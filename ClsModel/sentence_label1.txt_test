I gotta take the world's biggest fucking piss
If you're not, then nobody
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, little lady
Are you through having a tantrum
And then, before the sentence was over,  you threw a "fucking" in there to emphasize your "irritatance.
All right
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring
So, what's the plan, man
Okay, is Christian Simonson gonna be there
He's gonna be there with Jesse Letterman
Yeah, well, when I'm redecorating his house in the hills  that I am also living in, I'll let you know it worked
Okay, we're pretty clear on what it is you didn't do
Dressed
They call it "the thing"
They like it better than no thing
Whose couch
Mmm, the plot thickens
And then he starts to whine, "Oh, right now?
And he says, "well, wait
You don't even know what I'm gonna say.
Jesse Letterman..
He said, "I am letting you and your girlfriends stay at my lake house,  not you and a bunch of horny boys trying to get their fuck on with my daughter.
I have my own relationship with Ben,  and you're just jealous 'cause it don't include you
So when are the boys showing up
Maybe they can bring some pot
Oh, come on
"Oh, come on," my ass
Oh, my God
You wanna join us
So you must be the infamous Butterfly
Yeah, now thanks to you, we gotta tell her sooner than later
Julia, what the fuck did you say about me on the radio
Sure
Okay, Marcy, take it
Howdy
Shh
Oh, you did, did you
Yeah
Nah, man
But for your information, skinny bitch,  black men and a whole lot of motherfucking white men  have had plenty fun adoring my ass
All right, if you're not gonna buy me a drink, can I have mine back
What can I get you
And then, if they say that...  you gotta give them a lap dance
Oh, come on
It's gonna be funny

Well, good to meet you, Stuntman Mike
Thank you, Julia
What the fuck was that
I asked him what movies you worked on
You know the show The Virginian
Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians doubling Gary Clarke
No
How's that
I'm ready to blaze
Now the party can start

Boys or just us girls

Mike
Did I miss my chance
Yeah, I know
But that's what I love about Austin
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all, but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf
I just got lucky
And you look a little touchéd
That kind of hurt your feelings a little bit, didn't it
So...  how about that lap dance
You're still a nice girl,  and I still like you
What's your name again
My friend Jungle Julia over here says that jukebox inside is pretty impressive
We're gonna go somewhere else
We're gonna go hang out
Lookin' good, Cannonball Run
I can hear you
Yeah, well, I wanted it to be impressive
You've seen a movie where a car gets into some smashup  there ain't no way in hell anybody's walking away from
Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays, more often than not, you're right
I just didn't know you could make a car death proof
That's where you put the camera
Yeah, well, actually, I didn't ask to drive you home
I thought so
Well, because there was a 5050 shot on whether you'd be going left or right
What the fuck
I'll fucking rip your fucking...  Stop the fucking car
I know it's a joke, and it's superfunny
No, no, no, no
You're gonna play it next song, right

And if you ask me, he should have
Dr. Block
Well, what's the patient's prognosis, Dr. Block
Is that it
So, Pop, what do you think
Well, what we have here is a case of vehicular homicide
Every one of them gals was swimming in alcohol  and floating on weed
Them pretty little gals look like a goddamn giant  chewed 'em up and spit 'em out
Shit
That was just plain old goddamn reckless endangerment
But I got me a goddamn bartender gonna testify  that old Stuntman Mike didn't drink a drop all night,  and his passenger was left stranded by her date  in the goddamn rain, no less, and she asked him for the fucking ride
Search for evidence, you know, to prove my theory
I thought about it a lot
So, are you on the same floor with him
Mmm, he's damn good

Oh, you best get your ass off Kim's car
Okay
See you in a second
And you get 15 and change back
Thought I'd ask
This month's
He'll let it go for 27 bucks
What the fuck do you care
Okay
Oh, my God
Fucking hell
How does that happen
The director, Cecil Evans, is so much fun
Name sounds promising
He likes to watch me pee
You're having one off with The Rock
Oh, yeah
No dick this trip
How long have you had this boyfriend
Kim
Oh, Abbie's got the big kahuna
Nigga, please
Yes, men are dogs
Yeah, he's a standin fucker
Thank you
Did he know it was your birthday
He made you a tape
Yes
That sounds like the test of true love to me
It just sounds like there's a little more to it than that
What do you mean, "No, of course not"
The reason Cecil hasn't had a girlfriend in six years is because girls will fuck him
Have you let him do anything
You're not fucking him...  Mmmm
Actually, uh, it was Cecil's sex life that was on the table and your lack of one
So, Zoë, Kim and I are in the Philippines at an outdoor rave
What were you working on
It's dark as hell, and you can't see shit
Nice
Yep
Just as I'm thinking, "There's that ditch Abbie was talking about,"  bam, I'm in the fucking ditch, you know
If I fell in that fucking thing,  I probably would've been fucking paralyzed
Yeah
Having said that,  before you get too envious of Zoë's prowess,  you're missing the most important part of that story
So, Kim, you still pack a roscoe
I know this
Yeah
I didn't say it
Do I know
Don't do your laundry at midnight
I wanna do my laundry whenever the fuck I wanna do my laundry
Yeah
But until that day, it's wild West, motherfucker
Fuck me swinging, balls out
Not just that
So, back home..
Zoë's from New Zealand, and you never..
I really am
Pipe down, and I'll tell you
So, as of yesterday,  for sale, in this town,  some dude is selling a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger  with a 440 engine and a white paint job
Oh, uh, Kowalski
Oh, God
"Most girls"
Of course I did
Mmhmm
The real one, not that Angelina Jolie bullshit
Fucking legendary, mate
You ladies take your time
Oh, hell, no
Now, what did you say after the last time
Yeah, but...  "But," my ass
You said not only are we never gonna play ship's mast again,  but you also said if you ever do what you trying to do now  to not only refuse, but that I had permission  to physically restrain your ass if necessary
Damn skippy you meant it
You are such a liar
And when I said it, if I had known I was going to come to America  and had the opportunity to play ship's mast  with a fucking Vanishing Point Challenger,  I would've added a "however.
I'll be your best friend
You just order me to do it
And after a shower, you put moisturizer on my butt
What
I've been up all night
I should be in my hotel room asleep, not fucking around here on Tobacco Road
He is never gonna go for it if we all go
We're doing more than that
Actually, we're paying you a compliment,  'cause we gonna do some stupid shit
But you got good sense,  and anybody with good sense ain't gonna wanna do what we're doing
Okay
How you gonna do that
What are you gonna do, blow him
Not really
You just sit in the back, and I don't wanna hear  a peep out of your ass, you understand
Agreed
Jasper
I'm Abernathy
Okay, Abbie
How do I know y'all ain't just gonna steal it
Two, that would be rude
But Kim and I are, so we're totally trackdownable
Why does she look kind of familiar
Well, you see, we're making a Hollywood movie in town,  and it's a cheerleader movie, and she's one of the cheerleaders
Jasper, Lee
Gulp
I'm thinking we told your ass to shut the fuck up
You sure
I'm just saying
No, no, no, no
Um, ain't you 'posed to be my slave or some shit
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming
Well...  Fuck that
Please give her the belt
Whatever
You ain't that fucking hard
You know, I ain't six
Check this out
Whoohoo
All righty
What the fuck
Did you say something
Nothing
Hold on, Zoë
I can't
Zoë
I forgive you

No, God...  All right, get it together
Where the fuck do you think you're going
Gonna wiggle it at me

Hello, you poor devils
Then you are exactly the one I'm looking for

I don't care
Of course they're for sale
You shot Roscoe

Thank you

You go to hell, dentist
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale

Blueberry, didn't I give you my last apple
They ain't never seen no nigger on a horse before
It's still a bit early
Innkeeper
Sit down, my boy
But these days, I practice a new profession...  ...bounty hunter
After I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities
You kill people
Ah
If you're not in a position to refuse, all the better
So, I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement
I know what they look like all right
You travel with me until we find them
OK, boys
Now, why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble
[groaning]   [yelling]  [shot echoing]    Now you can get the marshal
I want six men, six rifles behind it
We got a hundred rifles aimed at every way out of that buildin'
You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head,  and I mean right now
You mean like you did our sheriff
Well, much as we'd all enjoy seeing something like that,  ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town
[doors squeaking open]  Come ahead
Thank you
The hell, you say
You're encouraged to wire him
In other words, marshal, you owe me $200
Django, I had no idea you were a married man
And the girl, too
Separately
You know when she was sold...  ...you know where she came from,  and you know her name
She wasn't born on the Carrucan plantation
Hmmm
When we gain access to these plantations, we'll be putting on an act
Hm
And your character is that of The Valet
Youse gonna let me pick out my own clothes
My valet does not walk
Not on my property
My name is Dr. King Schultz
And it is for these attributes we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee  to parley with you now
Oh, I'm afraid so
Oh, maybe while we discuss business,  you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures  to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds
<i>'</i> Django
He cannot be treated like a slave
Betina, sugar
You got it
His mama work over at the lumberyard
Yes'm, Big Daddy
You just treat him like you would Jerry
Po' little squirrels
I'm lookin' for three white men
You know 'em
I don't know them
You mean the Shaffers
Well, one's over in that field
If anybody should be gettin' whupped now,  it should be me
She's a... she's a house slave
I'm keeping it funny for you
Where the other two at
They whippin' Little Jody
Come on, girlie
You'd better give me that arm
Keep it funny
[groans]   Who were they
I don't know
Yes
I'm positive he dead
He's my deputy
Now, I reiterate, the warrant states dead or alive,  so when Mr. Freeman and myself executed these men on sight,  we were operating within our legal boundaries
Gimme
Posthaste
Now, unless they start shootin' first, nobody shoot 'em
I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing
I just made it worse
Can you see
[man] Yeah
Anybody bring any extra bags
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing
Now, look, let's not forget why we're here
OK, I'm confused
You get my vote, Robert
I didn't say no bags
That's a raid
out from under that wagon
What
Goddamn it
Big Daddy's getting away
Broomhilda is a German name
Oh, every German knows that story
Well, Broomhilda was a princess
Broomhilda's on a mountain
And there, Broomhilda shall remain
A fella named Siegfried
And he walks through hellfire...  ...because Broomhilda's worth it
But let me ask you a question
I thought you was mad at me for killin' Big John and Lil Raj
You work with me through the winter till the snow melts..
Why you care if I find my wife
Plus, when a German meets a real life Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal
Damn sight better than he deserves
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you

Oh, so you've heard of it
But when they tore her back up and then they...  ...burned that runaway "r" on her cheek...  ...they goddamned her
They gonna try to make her a comfort girl
So...  ...say...  ...a man wants to buy a horse
But now you're a horse thief, and they hang horse thieves
Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her, then how we gonna get her
We gonna offer to buy Candyland
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone  who is an expert on Mandingo fighting

Hmmm
In other words, first thing is first
Oh, Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like  not to hear your native tongue in four years
Dr. Schultz
You mighta caught yourself   a little dose of nigger love
It is the soaring eagle that attracts her attention,   not the plucked chicken
[all chuckle]  so down on yourself
Don't "who" me, bitch
You don't know him
OK.  Yeah
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about
Now, that $9,000 figure  Bright Boy's been bandyin' about, that ain't too far off from right
You know, Monsieur Candie, you do possess the power of persuasion
And a wise decision that is
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract  before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh
With my Mr. Tuttle
I say splendid, doctor
[all chuckling]  To The Black Hercules
So, Hildi, how you like servin' at the big table in The Big House, huh
Sure do
Huh
Go on
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf
Hildi's got somethin' like four lashes on her back

that warms my heart to hear that
Why,yes

Fine
If you'll excuse me a moment
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you regale us with a tale of the circus
Them motherfuckers ain't here to buy no Mandingos
They here for that girl
No
But...  Then he ain't bought diddly
Where you gettin' all this
You wouldn't pay no never mind to no $300
If it had been a snake, it would have bit me
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it
Yeah
Yes, we were, doctor
This is Ben
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...  ...and my daddy's daddy
[laughs]  Now, right out there on that porch, three times a week for 50 years,  Old Ben here would shave my daddy with a straight razor
If you examine...  ...this piece of skull here...  ...you will notice three distinct dimples
...I will admit you are pretty clever
Now lay your palms flat on that tabletop
Doctor
Am I right
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,  you yourself said that for the right nigger  you'd be willin' to pay what some may consider is a ridiculous amount
And I take it you prefer the "take it or leave it" style of negotiation
Easy, big fella

We're gonna sit down,'cause we ain't quite through yet
Sit down on this little red stool,  while I explain the f estivities of the evening to you
Chester
That shit don't help, treating a woman like a queen
Whatever constitutes a good time, as f ar as you guys are concerned, that's your business
Chester, your way of breakin' the news to him gently is scarin' the fuck outta him
I mean, I was thinkin' you might be thinkin'...  that we want you to do somethin' like weird sex thing,  you know, like, suck us off, pee on us, shit like that
No
But he's been here for 15 minutes and you have, you know, talked about everything but   What do you care
Whoa
Allow me to present our intentions to Theodore
Uh  Ah, if you saw it, you'd remember it
Anyway, Peter Lorre makes a bet with Steve McQueen...  that Steve McQueen can't light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row

Whether it's you who holds the axe or a Mexican maid...  or some bum we yank off the street
All right
Okay
Others which you remember f or the rest of your natural lif e.  Now, since what we're proposing here is so unusual,  so outside the norm,  that this is a good bet that this is going to be one of those incidents that sticks

Ahh
Perf ect, perf ect, perf ect
Ready
Chester, my fuckin' finger, man
Aaah
Wrap it up
He was expecting my call
Leo
Oh
I got it
You're on it
Let's go
Come on
I'll see ya
Yes
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself
I've read the reports of this area
To my knowledge,  those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers
Now, according to these papers,  all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for  except the Dreyfuses
So, monsieur LaPadite,  what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses
There were five of them
Thirty, 31
I'm not really sure
Monsieur LaPadite,  are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me
I'm aware
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is,  as opposed to most German soldiers,  I can think like a Jew  where they can only think like a German
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now,  would you greet it with hostility
Has a rat ever done anything to you  to create this animosity you feel toward them
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels  that you do with rats, do you
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search  of a house suspected of hiding Jews
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar,  he looks everywhere he would hide
That is unless you have something to tell me  that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary
It will be met with reward
Yes
Yes
ALDO: Tenhut
Once we're in enemy territory,  as a bushwhacking guerrilla army,  we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are
And the German will fear us
A debit you owe me, personally
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis
Lieutenant Aldo Raine
Then sit down
Wicki here,  an AustrianJew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good
Heard of him
Lieutenant Aldo Raine
When it comes to killing Nazis...   ..
We all come here to see if you want to go pro
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again,  you got to show me on this here map where they are
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees
Yes
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time,  and if you still respectfully refuse,  I'm calling The Bear Jew over
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that
Got us a German here who wants to die for country
Donny
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame
Donny, bring that other one over here
English
What kind of artillery
They'll shoot you
Yeah, that's what we thought
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off
They're films, ain't they
MAN: Right this way, Lieutenant
General Ed Fenech
The bar is in the globe
No junk in it
Don't be modest, Lieutenant
What should we drink to, sir
Yes
Explain it to me
An alternative to what he considers  the JewishGerman intellectual cinema of the '20s,  and the Jewishcontrolled dogma of Hollywood
Quite well, actually
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick
The master race at play
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere
It'll be you, her, and two Germanborn members of the Basterds

You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement
You said it was in a tavern
She's a British spy
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now
I don't look calm to you
Fair point, Lieutenant
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput
She's just an actress
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans
lt would appear there's only one thing left for you to do
British
ALDO: Speak English pretty good for a German
I'm a father
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing
Wilhelm
ALDO: Who's that
Who do you think
Wilhelm
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal
No guns me, no guns you
So what do you say, Willi
What choice you got, son
Now, get the girl and go
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal
All right, Aldo
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it
It's called suspicious
Yeah, I remember him
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate
How'd the shooting start
Germans would and did notice it
Tuxedos
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere
No
Least of all, by tomorrow night
Which is
What is that supposed to mean
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg
He's going to wrap it up in a cast,  and you got a good howlbrokemyleg mountainclimbing story
We both speak a little ltalian
Is that the plan
What else are we going to do
Omar, third most
I don't speak ltalian
Margheriti
HANS: Margheriti
Bunch of shithead fuck
Get off
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS
ALDO: Touch me again, Krautburger
Omar
What is that English expression about shoes and feet
Finding people is my specialty,  so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people
Just a name that stuck
Germans' nickname for you
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved
No, I guess not
That's a pretty exciting story
I have no doubt
But if I don't pick up this phone right here,  you may very well get all four
So, the way I see it,  since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction,  if I do nothing,  it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves
What kind of deal
A general
How fun
Over there is a very capable twoway radio and sitting behind it  is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann
You know, where I'm from...  Yeah
U p there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity,  but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family  selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits
Psst
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite  in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor  for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich
And I would like the United States of America  to purchase property for me on Nantucket lsland  as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved  by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party  to a swifterthanimagined end
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you
Yes, sir
Champagne
HANS: Hermann, uncuff them
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back
What have you done
You'll be shot for this
More like chewed out
I'd make that deal
When you get to your little place on Nantucket lsland,  l imagine you are going to take off that handsomelooking SS uniform of yours
That's what I thought
But I'm aware that ain't practical
I think this just might be my masterpiece
This is my TEC9

Yeah, you got a half a mill in Mexico and you want me to bring it in
So I said, "Look, you want proof he's getting paid for selling 'em
Yes
Now, let me lay it all out to you, okay
Mmmm, mmmm
If you listen, it's a damn good idea
Who
Yeah, I'm thinking a woman
'Cause I don't trust 'em
So, we gonna need two women
The Dell Amo Mal, the food court
I'm your manager
No, that's an agent
A manager gets 1 5%, agent gets 1 0
So he says, "Fuck that, " and moves over into guns
But you got to admit, he's not too bright
He moves his lips when he reads
Well  So, what are you trying to tell me?
That's not what I'm saying at al
You live with him, so  No, I live here
Well, that's what him and that stewardess are doing
You ain't gonna get serious while we're in here chilling
No
That bitch is gonna be fucking you two minutes after I'm out the door
Oh, so she ain’t your girlfriend?
Well...  the "not your girlfriend" part I felt more about
Oh, oh, shit
Hell, yeah
Oh
I knew it
I know her
Well, you can't trust Melanie,  but you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie
I was just calling to find out how everything went today at A. T.F
I don't know whether you still have it, but it's on it
Hope everything's well
Who?
You send some hardheaded rock whore up here and she  Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, don't forget your bags
Max
Just catching a movie
I know
You think he's got a thing for you?
Has he hinted around?
He's more interested in Ordell than he is in the money
You know where it came from
Half a million dollars will always be missed
I'm tired of it
Miss Brown?
The night you got me out of jail?
Yeah
Did you do that that night?
It's 1 9 years of this shit.
We gotta stop meeting like this

Money exchange, trial run

Hmm

Louis, Jackie

I knew you would try to pull some shit like that
It's my goddamn money
Oh, no
She's the one gonna be receiving the money
Louis, call Simone
We waiting on her
Are you sure I can't tempt you a little bit more?
I don't like that part
She ain't there
Now, you gotta listen to this, man, 'cause this concerns you, all right?
Okay, now, this time you’re going to get Sheronda a Billingsley bag, right
She knows what I look like?
Right, right, right, right
Because they're gonna be watching my ass hard
Right
Hey
Damn
Ordell has a guy working for him named Louis
Did you talk to him?
Mmmm
He definitely works for Ordell
Ordell’s got him staying down in Compton
Some white chick named Melanie, another girlfriend of Ordell's
It was her coke I got busted with
Everything's the same, except for one change
You know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit
Ordell feels way too hot for him to bring in his money,  and he knows you're watching him and he's fucking paranoid
He'll see 50,000
He didn't before
He's expecting to see 50,000, and there it is, on top
You get nothing
Well, a suit
Yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Goddamn it, I'm telling you, ain't nothing different
Well, I'm gonna open it
Ever been tempted
Put one of these in my pocket?
That would be one point of view
Don't go doing something stupid
How can I do anything stupid when I'm being watched every second?
I want you to put it in this Bilingsley shopping bag
Why're you putting  Winston
Where you going
Catch a movie, maybe somethin' to eat
Let's go
Well, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm waiting on her
We're late
Kiss my ass, fuck wad
Um, I think I like that suit
Wow
I mean, you wear that suit to a business meeting, and you'll be the badass in the room
Jackie?
Yeah
Boohyah
So, how much is it?
Wait

Are you sweating?
You just stay right here
Fuck it

Thanks
You fuckin' mongoloid
Can you ring it up for me
I understand
And away we go
Your change

I wasn't even gonna buy anything
Well, that's what I wanna tell you
It was totally fuckin' with my nerves, man
Twice
Well, how can you talk to her?
Is she dead?
II think so
She's dead
What?
I don't know
Neither did I
The fitting room
I swear on my life
Where you shot her?
Hey, I know the bitch tried to set me up
She didn't ask you
Now, what the fuck's that gonna tell ya
Oh, I'll be sure and ask that bitch before I blow her brains out
got it
And then she puts 40 grand or so in there to rub that shit in my face
Unless, you know, either she's got it or the Feds got it
You know what?
Like, maybe he was with his wife or his girlfriend
Max Che  You seen Max Cherry in the dress department where we  Man, look at me when I'm talkin' to you
And you don't think nothin' about him bein' there?
You know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes, don't you?
You gonna tell me reasons?
Her ass used to be beautiful
I thought I did
You see, I've had my eye on this suit...  that I've wanted, and, well, I'm just gonna go try it on   Wait a minute
The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it
Because I couldn't
And then somebody fuckin' killed her for it
But I couldn't go after her, because I was in my fucking underwear
What was I supposed to do if something happens?
Okay
You're clueless, right?
Not even a little idea
Yeah, if it'd motherfuckin' make you happy
Fuck
found him shot in the car on Ninth
It looks like Louis' buddy shot him twice, pointblank range
Hey, I have no evidence of you doin' anything
You didn't pay for that snazzy new suit with marked bills
I just got one thing to say
Oh, yeah, yeah, right
Motherfucker hung up on me
See, you bring a motherfucker up,  next thing you know they breaking you off some goddamned disrespect
Yeah, Max there?
He ain't here right now, man
All right
Do you know who this is?
Tell me where you are
Look here, man
And if she go to the police,  you tell her I will name her ass as my accessory
You're right
They don't have your winning personality
You bet
Got your money your bond refund?
This al?
She wants to give you your money
He finds people that don't wanna be found
She also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it
Jackie didn't trust Melanie
Y'all went to all that trouble just to protect my interest?
Don't worry about her
My office
She still is
It's in the safe:, she can't
When you told her that you'd name her as an accessory, that scared her more than anything
See, I ain't trust Melanie, either, but I could handle her
Jackie's at your office, huh?
All right
Usually, she too cool for school
I didn't know you liked the Delfonics
Hey, look at me when I 'm talkin' to you, motherfucker
There ain't nothin' you wanna tell me before we get out of this car, is there?
You sure?
I want you to keep your ass in front of me
That you?
He dead
What do you mean you found him?
She said you wanted him
Remember when you said you hoped you'd get him before he gets me?
It was fun gettin' a half million dollars in the mail
Well, you earned it

Could I excuse myself?
If I wanted to
This is me at my most masochistic
What you gonna do now, huh
Okay
Mommy, I'm home
Mommy, what happened to you and the TV room
This is an old friend of mommy's I ain't seen in a long time
How old are you, Nikki
You know, I had a little girl once
And I want you to leave us alone till I tell you to come out
This Pasadena homemaker's name  is Jeanne Bell
Mine, Black Mamba
So I suppose it's a little late for an apology
Look, bitch, I need to know  if you're gonna start more shit around my baby girl
Not rationality
To get even, even Stephen,  I would have to kill you, go up to Nikki's room, kill her,  then wait for your husband to come home and kill him
All I can tell you is that I'm a different person now
Bitch, you can stop right there
Just because I have no wish to murder you  before the eyes of your daughter  does not mean parading her around in front of me  is gonna inspire sympathy
Tomorrow
And we have us a knife fight
Fuck you, bitch
Weapon of choice
It was not my intention to do this in front of you
When engaged in combat...  the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the warrior's only concern
And next, we got some record
# Well #  # I'm just a single fellow with a lot on my mind #  # And I'm lookin' for me a woman #  # But she's mighty hard to find #  # Asked my country cousin #  # Checked the hottest spots in town #  # Oh, that little bitty woman #  Well, give me the gory details, Son Number One
And we're talking the whole shebang
It would appear somebody objected to this  and wasn't able to hold their peace
You better shitcan that blasphemy, boy
How can you tell
Who's the bride
The name on the marriage certificate  is Arlene Machiavelli
She's a little bloodspattered ngel
Yeah
Dying in our sleep is a luxury  that our kind is rarely afforded
Elle, you're going to abort the mission
Will you keep your voice down
But you didn't kill her
We've done a lot of things to this lady
Don't you agree, Miss Driver
I love you very much

At this moment, this is me at my most masochistic

I will not tolerate this
And while...  ...you laugh like stupid donkeys...  ...they weep in the afterlife..
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind
So that you understand how serious I am..
I encourage you from time to time,  and always in a respectful manner, to question my logic

Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you
Now, look, you know, she comes home from work in about an hour and a half
We don't wanna fuck your shit up
The phone is in my bedroom
Well, say she comes home
<i>She comes home from a hard day's work, finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...</i>  <i>doing a bunch of gangster shit...</i>  <i>there ain't no tellin'</i> <i>what she's liable to do.</i>  Yeah, I grasp that, Jules
I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs
I'm on the motherfucker
She the hysterical type
Jules
You're... Jimmie, right
We got one
Please do
If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking
Uhhuh
Take me to it
About the car, is there anything I need to know
Does it stall
Positive
You two
Now, Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house
Wipe down the upholstery
We need to raid your linen closet
I need blankets, I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads
I said, a please would be nice
Get it straight, Buster
I don't mean disrespect, okay
Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right
Green
Nobody who'll be missed
Okay
I wanna help
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is
And I'm positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...   Ginny
This is some fuckedup, repugnant shit
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red
That's all
You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail
I can't believe this is the same car
Quickly, gentlemen
What
Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head
Okay, gentlemen
The water's fuckin' cold
Better you than me, gentlemen
Come on, do it, goddamn it
We couldn't have planned this better
Dorks
We're laughing our way right into prison
Vincent, you follow in my Acura
Laws...   nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something
Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling
I don't know why
Like it never happened
So, what's with the outfits
I'm takin' milady out to breakfast
Say good night, Raquel
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work
I have character
Feel like havin' breakfast with me
Thank you
Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed
Pigs are filthy animals
That's a filthy animal
Dog eats its own feces
But a dog's got personality
I just been sittin' here, thinkin'
About the miracle we witnessed
And what's an act of God
It could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys
Now, whether or not what we experienced...  was an AccordingtoHoyle miracle is insignificant
You're really thinkin' about quittin'
Fuck
Like Caine in Kung Fu
So you decided to be a bum
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum
Garcon
If my answers frighten you...  then you should cease asking scary questions
I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee...  replayin' the incident in my head...  when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity
This is a robbery
You just be quiet over there
Get down
Move
You gonna give me a problem
I am not a hero
Yeah
You tell them to be fucking cool and everything will be over
Well done
Get the fuck down
In the bag
In the bag
Now get the fuck down on the floor
In the bag
Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing
Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst
Shoot him in the face
This ain't none of your goddamn business
Now, I'm gonna count to three
Okay, Ringo
Open it
Goddamn it, what is it
Be cool
Chill out, honey bunny
I promise
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody
Come on, Yolanda
Correctamundo
And when you do it...  you do it cool
Okay, now you let him go
And you don't want that
So let's see what we can do
Besides, I been through too much shit over this case this morning...  to just hand it over to your dumb ass
Point the gun at me
Tell her it's still cool
I'm proud of you
I love you too, honey bunny
It's the one that says bad motherfucker
Open it up
Okay, put it in your pocket
Vince, shut the fuck up
What
Well, there's this passage I got memorized
And you will know I am the Lord...  "when I lay my vengeance upon you.
But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice
Yeah, I'd like that
Yeah, that's probably a good idea
It's about a girl who's very vulnerable
Who the fuck is Τoby
It was a bigass hit for Madonna
I didn't say I hadn't heard of it
Borderline
Oh, Τoby's that little Chinese girl
Look, what the fuck was I talking about
Ηow many dicks is that
Pain
It hurts her
Wong
What do you mean when we leave
Give me it back now
"Τoby Chung
Gimme that book
You shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologise
You know what I heard
When it was big, I must have heard it a million trillion fuckin' times
(Laughter)  I must have zoned out during that part before
I'll take care of the check
Come on, throw in a buck
You know what these chicks make
Τhey make shit
I'll tip if somebody really deserves a tip
What's special
Look, I ordered coffee
Τhey make minimum wage
I used to work minimum wage  and I wasn't lucky enough to have a job society deemed tipworthy
Τhese people bust their ass
But society says, "Don't tip these guys here",  "but tip these guys here.
Fuck all that
What I won't do is play ball
Give me my dollar back
Mr Pink
Ηe don't tip
Come on, you, cough up a buck, you cheap bastard

Listen to me  you're gonna be fine
You're gonna wish you were dead, but it takes days to die from your wound
Gut shot
Ohh
As opposed to good
I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up
One minute they're not there, the next minute  they're there
Τhose were responding to the alarm
First, I just tried to get the fuck out of there
Τhey could be coming right now
I'm just gonna be in that room
I'll be right there looking at you
You know I felt funny about this job right off
I always said if I felt that way about a job I'd fuckin' walk and I didn't
Τake a breather
Yeah

Τhen the alarm gets tripped
Εverybody starts going ape shit
Τhe cops didn't show up until after Mr Blonde started shooting everybody

Τhat's the way I look at it
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us when he shot the place up
I mean, everybody panics  everybody
No, what you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional
Maybe 21
I never looked back
No chance they punched through
Εven if they did get away, then where the fuck are they
Where
We meet here
Τhey don't know our names but they could be singing about this place
We discovered one of the team was an undercover cop
Mr Brown
Maybe he set it up...  No, I don't bite

I'm right, OΚ
Alabama
We did about four jobs together, then decided to call it quits
Τhey've done a couple jobs together
Fiveman job   busting in and out of a diamond wholesaler's
What happened to Marcellus Spivey
What for
But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd
But on this particular day, they're getting a shipment of polished stones from lsrael
(Both laugh)  What's the cut, Papa
Ηuh
I thought he was dead for sure
Without medical attention, he will die for sure
We gotta book up
(Sighs) You got an idea, spit it out
Assuming we can trust Joe, how are we gonna get in touch with him
Ηe planned a robbery and he's got a blood bath on his hands
Well... all right, then I guess we take him to a hospital
Wait, wait
It was just a natural conversation
Ηe just got shot
I'm trying to comfort him...  telling him not to worry, everything's gonna be OK, I'm gonna take care of him,  and he asked me what my name was
Τell him, "I'm sorry, I can't give out that fuckin' information "  "it's against the rules"
I got a question  do they have a sheet on you where you're from
Now he knows A, your name, B, what you look like,  C, where you're from, and D, your specialty
If we don't, he's gonna die
You wanna shoot me, you piece of shit
You're looking at me like it's my fault
If you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror
Fucking kicking me
We didn't know what happened to you and Blue
We need you acting freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip
What makes you say that
Nobody's going anywhere
Don't take another step, Mr White
I got a big fuckin' problem...  with any triggerhappy madman who almost gets me shot
Asshole
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it
Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy...  or are you gonna bite
You're acting like a bunch of fuckin' niggers
But that was then
Somebody stuck a redhot poker up our ass  and I wanna know whose name's on the handle
Look, I know I'm no piece of shit, and I'm pretty sure you're OK,  and I'm positive you're on the level,  so let's try and figure out who the bad guy is, all right

Τell him yourself

No, you wouldn't
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy
Now, Εddie, when you came in here, we were talking some serious business
Seymour Scagnetti
Well, I wanna,  but first I gotta prove to asshead that I can  get a regular, you know, job, jobtype job,  before I can move out on my own
All right, we can work this out, can't we, Εddie
Vic, you're not gonna lift shit
Dock workers do very well
"We had to send him to Τaft airstrip five fuckin' hours away.
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews, I'll tell him what's what
Look, just let Εddie for now set you up at Long Beach
Τhen we'll talk to you, all right

If some nasty, lowlife,  scumridden motherfucker, man, sprayed diarrhoea all over one of the bowls
I still had a connection, which was insane  cause you couldn't get weed anyfuckingwhere
Like, they knew I still smoked,  so they asked me to buy some for them when I was buying for me
She never even had to meet these people
I couldn't even rent a fuckin' tape without six fuckin' phone calls interrupting me

So, anyway, one night she plays it real cool

Τhat sick piece of shit was a stonecold psycho
Ηe talked about what he was gonna do when he was slicing him up
Let me just say this out loud, cause I wanna get this straight in my head
I swear on my mother's eternal soul, it's what happened
So, Mr Orange...  you're telling me that this very good friend of mine,  who did four years for my father,  who, in four years, never made a deal, no matter what they dangled in front of him...  you're telling me that now that this man is free,  and we're making good on our commitment to him,  he's just gonna decide, out of the fuckin' blue... to rip us off

They won't get it
My sweet Cordelia
Skinny little Nancy Callahan
Did something happen to her
Nancy's 19 years old
She's forgotten you, old man
He stinks so bad, I want to throw up
How the hell did they find her
I've got to get out
You got me, Roark
What
on me back before the trial
They're scared of something
No, we're getting you out for time served, no strings attached
We'll use the law, the press..
Going to a lot of trouble for nothing
I'm going in there and I'm telling them I'm a twisted, wretched child molester
It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan
Christ
Eight years
She had two kids
Don't be
How could they have found out it was you writing all those letters to me
All she does is read and study and write
Nancy wouldn't have anything to do  with a pack of drunks and losers like this
Excuse me, miss
Her name is Nancy
Then it hits me
Lead the creep outside
I'm just a horny excon watching an exotic dancer
We need to get out of here right this second
Me and my dumb letters
Nobody but me can keep this heap running
Taken it to the range a couple of times
Hartigan, there's so much I've wanted to say to you
Damn
He doesn't know how to take his time
Gotta confirm the kill
It's OK. You did great
I'll be right back
And it's all over the place
[sirens wailing]  We're out of time
That's why I was sure you'd been kidnapped
I swore if I ever saw you again, I'd show you I grew up strong
all that good with people
All these years
Eight years
For God's sakes, you're just a kid
No, Nancy
Recognize my voice, you piece of shit cop
I've been suckered into betraying the only friend I've got,  put her in the hands of a rapist I thought I'd put down for good
My tools better be clean and sharp
I'd love him if I didn't hate him
And now you've led me back to your darling Cordelia
A little old for my taste, but I can forgive that just this once
She'll scream
No way to fight it now
This is the end
Give it a shot, old man
Stay conscious
You can do it
An engine of cyclopean power throbs beneath this steel stallion's hood
Every cop on the force  knows about the Roark family's farm and to stay away from it
Once things get loud, I'll have use for the cannons
"Nobody but me can keep this heap running," she told me
I'll bet he slapped you around something fierce
I was cured
Hate yourself later
[whip lashing]  [Roark grunting]  Do you think I'm tired
You're thinking the whip was the worst I could do
You can't get it up unless I scream
Damn
Good advice
Look at you
You can't even lift that cannon
I'm taking no chances with you
Both of them
I didn't scream
She's herself again
You better get rolling
I can't lose you, not again

Maybe after I've pulled off that miracle, I'll go and punch out God
She'll never be safe

Three hours later and my head is feeling several sizes too big
You'd have to check her pulse or notice those perfect breasts of hers  aren't moving like if she was breathing
Why the kindness, Goldie
Somebody paid good money for this frame
why you died, Goldie
And when his eyes go dead, the hell I send him to  will seem like heaven after what I've done to him
You got any beers around this place
Thanks
The pills come from a girlfriend who's a shrink
How do you suppose I'm gonna square this with the board
This isn't some barroom brawl
This is blood for blood, and by the gallons
There's no choices left
But I'm out
But I'll have to sneak past Mom,  and her ears have gotten a whole lot better since she went blind
For a while we just get the feel of each other back
Is that you, baby
I couldn't sleep for the worry
Oh, I... cut myself shaving
I'm gonna find that son of a bitch that killed you,  and I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye
So does your face
Nancy's just getting started with her gig,  but already the crowd's breathing hard
I'm here to do you a favor
What'll it be, Marv
Show's over, dickwad
[Marv] Take it off
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie
Who sent you
For a second, I smell the angel smell that belonged to my Goldie
How many got paid off for the frame, Louie
How many for the kill
your sins, my son
By way of a "for instance," I killed three men tonight
Roark
It's all there
[gunshot]  Worth going to hell for
Goldie
This is a bad place, this farm
People have died here...  [soft growling]  the wrong way
It's whoever owns you I'm curious about,  because there's blood on your breath, and I think I know what kind
I go blind
You killed Goldie
Lucille
It's him
Take a nice, slow breath
The heads on the wall
He made me watch
You've brought us some big trouble this time, Marv
What hooker
But I didn't know that
Quiet
[grunts]  [thudding]  You're not gonna get either of us killed, Marv
He's unconscious and unarmed,  so there's no need to kill him
I just killed and what he told me
It wasn't till I showed him all those pieces of himself that he said it
And here he's gonna get killed in the name of a dead hooker
What if I'm wrong
A psycho killer
Lucille said Goldie was a hooker,  and if she was, she has roots here:  Friends, maybe even family
No wonder I'm seeing things
Because that's my name, you ape
Goldie was my sister
Would any of you dames let me get close enough to you to kill you
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn thing about those other girls, did they
Nuts
You sat there and took it,  when you could've taken my gun away any time you wanted to
What style do you want
I'm too dumb to put the whole picture together yet,  but she fires up two cigarettes and hands me one,  and I taste her lipstick on it
I'm gonna be needing a dozen twofoot lengths of this rubber tubing...  and a spool of razor wire...  and a pair of those special gloves that'll let me handle the wire
and I crawl back inside myself
Yes, Marv
Kill him good
to the kitchen
and breathe the fire out of my lungs
She was my sister
I'm sorry, kid, but I haven't even started with this creep,  and I don't want you watching the rest
Well, what do you know
not even when the mutt's had its fill  and Kevin's guts are lying all over the place
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers
Who's the babe
What about you
I owe you, Goldie
No sign of target
The dog ate the rest
Don't scream or I'll plug you
What the hell do you know
He didn't just eat their bodies, he ate their souls
And then your... Goldie almost ruined everything
Who would believe a thug like you
No satisfaction
Everything up until the killing will be a gas
It's so stupid
Night after night, I wait for somebody to come and finish me off
They don't ask me any questions
They nail me for the works, not just the people I did kill,  but even Lucille and the girls that Roark and Kevin ate,  and even Goldie
I got 'em for you good, didn't I, Goldie
You can call me Goldie
The goddess
I haven't got all night
Hit it
There is no way in hell I'm letting you in
It meant plenty
Especially the kind of total jerk loser  who has to beat up on a girl to make himself feel like a man
I'll take care of this
He's got four friends out there in the hall,  breathing hard and just as drunk as he is
I'm no racist
OK, baby, you know what I can do
All right, all right
None of these bozos got lives, they gotta hang out with you
That's a man's shirt, and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine
He flew out the window just as soon as he heard you were coming,   'cause you scared him so bad
You goddamn bastard
[men laughing]  Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy
[scoffs]  I'm a generous guy
I've been told
You got a couple phone calls you ought to make
I'm Shellie's new boyfriend and I'm out of my mind
No questions, damn it
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine
Dwight, he was from a while back,  before you showed up again with that new face of yours
No, don't go
It's a chance I shouldn't be taking,  but I can't go home and forget about it,  and let Jackie Boy and his pals find their fun
across the park  to pick up Jackie Boy heading like a bat outta hell up the hill
Then Jackie Boy saves me a great, big, steaming pile of trouble
Not for long
He knows he's not the law, not in Old Town
But if you cross 'em,  you're a corpse
Things they'd done to guys who got out of line
We'll get you there
Besides, I don't do group jobs
Baby doll, I've had me one hell of a bad day
Everything's under control
arguing with her
You worry too much
Not right now
He's outta control
And she's been aching for some practice
Save yourself and your buddies a ton of grief
They're scum
And they won't
I'm a little on edge
It's a good night's sleep
Get in the car
Oh, God, no
He's got squat
Yeesh
I got friends you can't imagine
She blocked the barrel
I can't see
She makes a Pez dispenser out of him
I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants
Iron Jack, the papers call him
They get to defend their own tun'
That keeps the girls free to keep the pimps and the mob out
The streets will run red with blood
We'll fight the cops and the mob  and anybody else who tries to move in on us
Make sure it's a hardtop with a decent engine
I'll hide the bodies
I'll haul the bodies to the pits
And you were gone, off playing with that barmaid
They'll catch you
Not yet, they won't
She almost yanks my head clean off,  shoving my mouth into hers so hard it hurts
Always... and never
Sure, Becky, go home
You'll catch cold if you don't
I just want to hear my mom's voice
We were barely able to get the trunk closed as it was,  we packed it so tight
You're dead
Well, it tells you something about your state of mind, don't it
A smoker's a smoker when the chips are down
What are you gonna do when you run outta gas, call AAA
Not unless you keep your eyes on the road, sugar pie
Watch it
You're flushed
None of that stops the bastard from being absolutely right
Tough call
I don't know what to do
Well, you're driving with a busted tail light
Jackie Boy will go into the damn tar pits,  I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks, go home and call it a...  No more questions, Dallas
We're in lockdown
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty will be in our possession,  and the truce between your prostitutes and the police will be shattered
You will all be slaves
I know you
I can't fathom these Americans always whining  and going on about how they got it so bad
Guiding light of the modern world, it is
It's all bent up
They were mercenaries
every last inch of the man, Brian
No air to breathe
Let it in
You're Elvis
It's a cinch
Miho, I hope to hell you left one of 'em alive enough to talk
Sometimes, that means dying
What do we do
I got it
I'm as helpless as a baby
It was an outright lie I was giving ya about me revolver being wet
She twists the blade
I tell Miho what we're gonna do and how we're gonna do it
What, are you kidding me, man
Your nerves, responsive
It's over, Gail
You sold us out
It wasn't your mom
Breaks your heart, doesn't it
Your precious, scrawny, little neck
No, I was promised
Nobody
Will you look at that
Guys, look
McCarthy, you fool
But the alley is crooked, dark and very narrow
You can have Old Town, I don't care
Of course, Mr. McCarthy
Every step of the way
Cute trick, McCarthy, but it will do you no good
No escape,  no surrender, no mercy
Every last one
Deadly, little Miho
Who the hell are you, and what happened to them
I got paperwork on 'em in my pocket
You know I am
Well smoke..
Fella in the wagon
Well...  That's what I'll do
Not so much
Col. Something Warren, right
I know you too
So why don't you explain to me...  What an African bounty hunter's doin' wanderin'  around in the snow in the middle of Wyoming
What happened to your horse
Well I guess that makes this one fortuitous wagon
I sure as hell hope so
I been called worse
How much
Now that ten thousand's practically in my pocket
I ain't got no designs on her
I sure hate to interrupt y'all
Now shut your mouth and hold them damn horses while I think
They are real pretty, ain't they
Give o.B
We get goin' a lot quicker you help out too
Now do you got that
That's too bad
You could say he was my best friendif I  considered stupid animals firends, which I don't
If by woman, you mean her
Gonna' wait to watch it
We talked about this in chattanooga
Can't catch me sleepin' if I don't close my eyes
But when John Ruth the hangman catches ya',  you don't die by a bullet in the back
But in the brains department,  he like a man who took a high dive in a low well
I still got, what
The Lincoln letter
Look, I know you gotta' be real careful with it and all
But...  As your saving my life an' all,  I suppose I could let you read it again
They was pen pals
Whoa, easy
That nigger like to bust my jaw
How is it
What
This changes things, son
But with a partner, eighteen's a whole lot better
Chapter two son of a gun  hand your weapons to the driver
I done did it
Is that you Chris mannix
Only by reputation
I just wanna' ride
Mannix's marauders
What brings you in my path, Chris mannix
Where is your star
Well I ain't the sheriff yet
And from the look of those three frozen fuckers up there,  I figure you're a bounty hunter open for business
Daisy domergue
Well I'll be double dogged damned
Yeah it's really me and it's really my head
Well execuse me for findin' it hard to belive a  town electin' you to do anything except drop dead
No I suppose not
Could you come down here and join us
Yeah
There ain't no bounty on my head, bushwacker
Now..
Y'all wanna' lie on the ground and make snow angels together
I don't drink,  with rebel renegades, and I damn sure don't break bread with 'em
Ya' wrapped yourselves up in the rebel flag as an excuse to kill and steal
You wanna' show me how grateful you are..
I don't think so
None of them found fortune
Now it didn't stay 30 thousand the length of the war
Why did they have a reward on you
You ain't never heard of wellenbeck prisoner of war camp, West Virginia
So I burnt it down
Southern youth, farmer's sons,   cream of the crop  and I say, "let 'em burn"
Drop a big ole' rock on their head
And I made them trees, mannix
Wasn't the final yankee death count somethin' like thirtyseven
But if memory serves,  your side didn't look at it that way
If he did all that, the cavalry woulda' shot him
Cavalry tends to look kindly on that
Don't you say anything about my daddy,  what he fought for,  was dignity in defeat, and against the unconditional surrender
You gonna talk that hateful nigger talk,  you ride up top wtih o.B
Like I said y'all, I'm just happy to be alive
Chapter three minnie's haberdashery  get in there
But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,  so it looks like you're stuck with us
He's lookin' after the place while they gone
Get 'em outta this cold, before that blizzard hit's 'em
You heard him freeloaders, get to work
You gotta' nail it shut
Hold it shut
One ain't good enough
Gimme that other piece of wood
Who's the idiot who broke that, that Mexican fella'
When did you fella's arrive
I think we all felt the same way, but were a little too polite to say something
Where's the well water
Coffybeans
Good
No he's lyin'  he ain't sheriff of nothin'  he's a Southern renegade
You're a bounty hunter
Why
You're suppose to produce it upon request
I got my warrant, oswaldo
Transporting a desperate hostile prisoner such as her  sounds like hard work
And why is her hanging proper, so important to you
Looks like I brought you a customer
You got it
The bar is open, follow moi
Come on, goddamnit I'm cold
Should be done soon
I'll give you a hand
Muchas gracias
And, if... You're found guilty,  the people of red rock will hang you in the town square
And after busting down that door, they drug you out  in the snow and hung you up by the neck, that,  we would be frontier justice
The bad part is it's apt to be wrong as right
It's my job
I hang you in red rock, I move on to the next town, I hang someone else there
Yeah, well...  You got it
Am I in it
I am
And I don't know who you are
About nine miles outside of red rock
My mother
For the first time in my life I,  made a pretty penny and, eh...  Come home and spend time with my mother for Christmas
I mean..
General
I've been called worse
It's already cold enough in here
There is a hammer and nails right there
It's gonna' blow right open
Goddamn it
Thank you
Oh, you are
Yes I am
Horseshit
You comin' into red rock to hang Lance Lawson
Precisely
But all that just to guard her
Yeah
The letter from Abraham Lincoln
Not him
Say your name was again
They ain't here
Yes
That sure don't sound like minnie
But it sounds peculiar, though,  what sound peculiar
Yes
She rolls her own
Yeah I do, senor Bob
Well, I'll be double dogged damned
According to the Yankees, it's a free country
I heard you gave those blue bellies sweet hell
Hell yeah, we did
That would be nice
Here we go general
My son, Chester Charles smithers,  he died out here a few years back
Never to be heard from again
No chance he could be livin' "the cold life" out in  the woods
Fucking hold it low
There you go, motherfucker
Considering minnie's no hats indoors policy
A large black dog
You know my daddy, I said that my daddy
I said the army of north Virginia would have been used in very different way
But I know he's a nigger
Inform the nigger in the cavalry officers uniform  that I had a division of confederates under my commend,  in Baton Rouge
Oh that's interesting
We had neither the time or the food
I damn will guarantee that too
The northern side and the Southern side
One of them fella's is not what he says he is
And they got 'em coupla' days
Our best bet is this,  duplicitous fella' ain't as cool a customer as Daisy here
If he can't handle it, he'll stop waiting
And what do you got to say about all this
Okay everybody,  hear this
That money's mine boys
Really
Because I'm gonna' take your gun, son
Nothing personal
I'll protect you
Blink if you're calm
I'm real sorry about this, son
Just a precaution
O.B.
I'm gonna' cut you loose while we eat
So domergue,  I suppose this blizzard counts as a stroke of luck as far as you're concerned
How 'bout you oswaldo
But mean bastards, you need to hang
You okay, o.B.
So...  How you doin', black major
I ain't in the mood, Chris mannix
You did say, didn't ya'
Abraham Lincoln the president of the United States..
As in: "Dear maj. Warren"
Yes
Yes
Practically a friend
What's the matter, John Ruth
I know,  I'm the only black son of a bitch you ever met, so I'm gonna' cut you some slack
Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it
Good for you, sister
Yes you may
Fever took her, started this last winter
Atlanta boy, and a Augusta girl
God damnit
Yeah, your son came up here a few years back
I know the day he died,  do you
You wanna know what day that was
All them fella's came up here sang a different tune,  when they found themselves at the mercy of a nigger's gun,  "let's just forget it
I go my way, you go yours"   that's your boy Chester talkin'  you a goddamn lie
You shut your lyin' nigger lips up
It was colder than that
Right down to his bare ass
But this time he wasn't begging to go home
All he wanted... was a blanket
You  ain't never been cold as your boy was that day
You bet your sweet ass it was warm
No blanket
Ignoring how I made him...  Lick, all over my Johnson
The dumbest thing your boy ever did...  Was to let me know..
Marquis Warren who is supremely confident about the  legality of what just transpired, ignored them  sat at a table by himself and drank Brandy
John Ruth held the door close, waiting for Joe gage and o.B
John Ruth...  Yeah
That's why this chapter is called...  Domergue's got a secret
You come back with anything else but a guitar
I got it
Go ahead, sing it
Gimme that guitar
Oh my god
Everybody get your back sides up against that back wall over yonder
You too, senor Bob
Let me hear you say, "I got it"
Chris mannix, come over here on this side
And I mean, anything
'Cos you almost drunk it your own damn self
Gimme the key
Or two of y'all is workin' with her
But John Ruth's trying to hang your woman,  so you kill him... okaymaybe
He damn sure is you sons of bitches
And about the men standin' next ta' ya' would be responsible
Let's slow it down
How long you say minnie been gone
And there was another fellow on the plantation, uncle charly
So if minnie's on the north side visiting her mama for a week,  how'd she make the stew this morning
This... is sweet Dave's chair
And if... he went to the north side..
And if it's you,  that means minnie and her man ain't at her mama's
Which makes it you, Joe gage
I was sitting on that side of the room
But you didn't count on the blizzard and you didn't count on the two of us
Or can you prove it, cabrone
If you would have been here two and half years ago  you'd know about the sign usta' hang above the bar
And it hung over that bar every day till she  took down, a little over two years ago
But when you tell me minnie mink took the habadashery,  the most precious thing to her in the whole world,  and left it in hands of a goddamn Mexican
Four measly bulltes and there goes senior, Bob
If I don't hear a confession from one of you  motherfuckers quick, fast and in a hurry,  I'm gonna' pull this whole pot of coffy, down that bitches goddamn throat
You gonna' die now you murderin' bastard
Warren can I kill him
I ain't got no gun, sheriff
Well I can't give him a seat I don't have   listen why don't you take the passengers inside, introduce them to minnie
Here we are everybody, minnie's haberdashery
Come on in everybody, don't be shy
Lovley smile, that Gemma
Hi ya' Dave
Joe gage
Stove, fireplace, whatever
Oh, and Judy said something about the best coffy in the world
Yes, ma'am, but fix the coffy
Got 'em, Ed
Miss minnie
You play
You speak French
Oui  yes
Just do it
Are you the jelly bean salesman around here
Okay
I brought in your bags in case anybody wants  to change your clothes before red rock
Rock steady
Is it anywhere near old Zealand
It's where I'm from, it's our biggest city
Passengers, not so much
Do we collect the bodies and Chuck 'em in the well out there
Well hang on, by puttin the horses away that's easy enough
And when it comes to that pile of niggers we building out back,  won't take nothin' to make you general of it
Later today,  dirty son of a gun's gonna come in here
You know why
That's why
No I don't
So when they get here,  you just sit your ass in this chair
Hello, thank you, good night and...   Maybe your name
Do you understand
Deal, thank you
And waited for John Ruth and Daisy's stage to arrive
So the name of the game here is patience
Good luck, mate
This ain't the normal line
And sweet Dave inside
Well whoever you are, help o.B
Get 'em outta this cold, before that blizzard hit's 'em
Open up
That's how I'm doin'
Just make yourself comfortable
You
two!..
Don't shoot her
Well you better shit another pistol out your ass
Slowly come on up
What are you doin' he was giving up
Keep your hands flat on that table
Mannix
I am workin with all three of them fella's..
He's a big bad cat
Wich finally explains why you're worth ten
Now with brohter deadd, I'm in charge of this gang, right boys
Hold it Warren
What's... your... deal
When the snow melts...  We go back to Mexico and you go on to red rock to get that star pinned on your chest
Under the name "English Pete hicox" I've gotta' federal  bounty of fifteen thousand dollars on my head
Joe gage, who you be
But you'll never spend a cent of that bounty money  and you'll never leave this mountain alive
Cause I doubt you can drive a four horse team
Fifteen killer strong
You wanna save the town
You belive in Jesus now, huh, bitch
Give me my pistol
Yeah
You gonna make a deal with this diabolical bitch
So I kill, Warren... And we're all friends
You see..
What I belive is...  Joe gage or grouch douglass whatever the fuck his name was...  Poisoned the coffy...  And you watched him do it
I'm lookin' at 'em, right here right, right  now
You're gonna' die on this mountain, Chris
I don't feel so good
Get up
Your ass ain't nailed to the floor
Now we've come to the part of the story...   Where I blow your goddamn head off
What's the Las thing...  That bastard did, 'fore he died
"But mean bastards, you need to hang"
I wanna watch
Dear marquis..
I'm very proud everytime I hear new of you...  We still have a long way to go, but hand in hand..
