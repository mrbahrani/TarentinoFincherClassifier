label1 ﻿1 Hold on
label1 I gotta come up
label1 We can't be late
label1 We won't
label1 If you're not then nobody
label1 We were kind of hoping you were
label1 Yeah
label1 How are you not holding
label1 Jesus Christ Shanna
label1 It is not my fucking job to supply y'all with weed when we go out
label1 Whoa whoa whoa whoa little lady
label1 I was just teasing you
label1 I'm not angry
label1 It just would be nice if y'all didn't just count on me all the fucking time  and surprise me every once in a while with pot
label1 Okay mean girl in a high school movie
label1 Are you through having a tantrum
label1 You've been in the car all of two seconds and you're already cursing at me
label1 I am not cursing at you
label1 You said "Jesus Christ Shanna.
label1 And then before the sentence was over  you threw a "fucking" in there to emphasize your "irritatance.
label1 Come on guys
label1 Don't fight
label1 I'll pay for it when we get some
label1 One: It is not about the money
label1 It is about the pain in the ass of scoring
label1 And two: We're not really fighting
label1 That wasn't a fight
label1 That was Julia acting like a grumpy bitch  and me calling her on it and indulging her at the same time
label1 That's how we tolerate each other after all these years
label1 Oh billboard
label1 So what's the plan man
label1 Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's
label1 Of course
label1 You're so good
label1 I know
label1 You bet your ass he is
label1 Christian Simonson the filmmaker is in town
label1 He's got a big thing for Julia
label1 If he had a big thing for me he'd fucking call me  as opposed to disappearing for six months  and he'd get his ass down here more often than he does  and on my birthday give me a fucking phone call
label1 Oh billboard
label1 Yeah but you get those legs of yours around him and it's all over
label1 Yeah well when I'm redecorating his house in the hills  that I am also living in I'll let you know it worked
label1 So margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's touch base with Chris and Jesse  tell them about later and make damn sure they come
label1 Oh shit
label1 Speaking of which what happened with you and Nate last night
label1 Well you know not mu... We just fucking met each other
label1 I mean if you don't bust their balls a little bit they're never gonna respect you
label1 How about enlightening us on what it is you did do
label1 Nothing to write home about
label1 We just made out on the couch for about 20 minutes
label1 Dressed halfdressed or naked
label1 Dressed
label1 We didn't do the thing
label1 Excuse me for living but what is "the thing"
label1 You know it's everything but
label1 I call it "the thing.
label1 Do guys like the thing
label1 Okay I wanna get back to what it is you did do
label1 So you're making out on the couch with Nate right
label1 Correct
label1 Whose couch
label1 His or the one in your hotel room
label1 What am I stupid over here
label1 Mine
label1 We started sitting up
label1 We worked our way to lying down
label1 Mmm the plot thickens
label1 I was straddling him
label1 What else
label1 That was it
label1 So we made out for a little while on the couch  and I said "Okay I'm gonna go to bed now so it's time for you to leave.
label1 And then he starts to whine "Oh right now?
label1 And he says "well wait
label1 what about this?
label1 And I said "No.
label1 He said "What do you mean no
label1 You don't even know what I'm gonna say.
label1 I said "I already know what you're gonna say  and the answer's no.
label1 I said "Because you're gonna say 'let's just go to sleep together
label1 "'We don't gotta do nothing
label1 "'Just cuddle sleep next to each other wake up in the morning together.
label1 No you're gonna leave but I'll see you tomorrow.
label1 Yeah fuck Nate
label1 Jesse Letterman..
label1 You can hang out with him you can make out with him  but no hooking up with him because we are driving to Lake LBJ tonight  and my daddy's pretty clear about one thing
label1 He said "I am letting you and your girlfriends stay at my lake house  not you and a bunch of horny boys trying to get their fuck on with my daughter.
label1 Your dad talks like that
label1 Hell yeah
label1 It's not like he ain't gonna know either  because when I'm staying at the lake house with my girlfriends in our bikinis  Daddy just has a tendency to pop up and make sure we don't need anything
label1 Look he's totally harmless and cute as a bug's ear
label1 And if you flirt shamelessly with him like the sixfoot baby giraffe in the backseat  you got a puppy dog for life
label1 I have my own relationship with Ben  and you're just jealous 'cause it don't include you
label1 You call her dad Ben
label1 I'm not a child
label1 So when are the boys showing up
label1 They're gonna meet us at the Chili Parlor
label1 Maybe they can bring some pot
label1 No
label1 I don't wanna be either A depending on their fucking ass  or B depending on their ass
label1 Uhuh
label1 We don't score ourselves  we're gonna be stuck with them all fucking night
label1 Ooh try Lanna Frank
label1 Oh hey that's your last billboard before Guero's
label1 Oh come on
label1 Give me a break
label1 "Oh come on" my ass
label1 We said every time
label1 Jules let me get a drag
label1 Thanks
label1 Oh my God
label1 days Arlene
label1 Hey
label1 You wanna join us
label1 For a second but I'm with some friends
label1 Oh
label1 So you must be... must be..
label1 Shh
label1 She don't know nothing about it
label1 Know about what
label1 When were y'all gonna tell her
label1 Soon
label1 Tell me what
label1 Yeah now thanks to you we gotta tell her sooner than later
label1 All right cut the shit
label1 I said a little somethin'somethin' about you on the air today
label1 All I said was I had a sexy friend named Butterfly  who was in from out of town for the weekend  and we would be going out somewhere in Austin tonight  and if they were out on the town maybe they'd see us
label1 And I described you and I said that if they spotted you while we were out  if they'd do something you'd do something
label1 Okay now Julia I'm serious
label1 What did you say and what did you say I'd do
label1 Anyhoo I could explain what I said which would be boring  or Marcy over here  who is an incredible actress could act it out for you  which I think will give you a better idea  of what you have in store for you tonight
label1 Okay so just tell me your way
label1 So we'll act it out with Marcy
label1 Okay give Marcy your drink
label1 Okay so you're in a club or a bar  and Marcy's a kind of cute or kind of hot or kind of sexy  or better be fucking hysterically funny but not funnylooking guy  who you could fuck
label1 Got it
label1 Okay Marcy take it
label1 Howdy
label1 Hi there
label1 Excuse me but your name wouldn't be Butterfly would it
label1 It seems you have me at a disadvantage
label1 Pleased to meet you Barry
label1 Y'all are getting me hot
label1 Shh
label1 So is uh Butterfly your real name
label1 Yes it is
label1 And how'd you know my name Barry
label1 I listened to Jungle Julia's show this morning
label1 Oh yeah
label1 I listen to her show every morning
label1 Oh you do do you
label1 Yeah
label1 She's like the coolest lady in town
label1 Nah man
label1 I like her ass that way
label1 She got a black girl's ass
label1 She's got a big ass
label1 Okay what the fuck are you doing
label1 Oh look who wants to get to the point all of a sudden
label1 Okay we'll get to the point
label1 But for your information skinny bitch  black men and a whole lot of motherfucking white men  have had plenty fun adoring my ass
label1 All right if you're not gonna buy me a drink can I have mine back
label1 No
label1 Okay okay okay okay
label1 So Butterfly can I buy you a drink
label1 What can I get you
label1 I'll take a margarita
label1 Here you go
label1 "Did you hear me Butterfly
label1 Miles to go before you sleep.
label1 What
label1 If they call you Butterfly buy you a drink  repeat that poem you gotta give them a lap dance
label1 That's bullshit
label1 I ain't giving them nothing
label1 Well you can do it or not but if you don't  everybody in Austin's gonna think you're a chickenshit
label1 I ain't giving nobody no lap dance 'cause of what you said
label1 Oh come on
label1 Yeah everything's funny to you two when it's happening to me
label1 Look you don't have to do it for anybody you don't want
label1 I said you'd do it for the first guy who says it
label1 So some geek comes over trying to be cool  just tell him you already did it at another place earlier
label1 But maybe a little later in the evening  you've had a few drinks you're kind of looseygoosey  you're safe with your girls  then some kind of cute kind of hot kind of sexy hysterically funny  but not funnylooking guy comes up and says it  then maybe you did it earlier maybe you didn't
label1 You made me trip

label1 So is it "Shawna" and the girls at the lake house this weekend
label1 Oh fuck
label1 I...  No
label1 Now there is one thing that every girl in the whole world  whose name is Shanna has in common with each other  we all hate the name Shawna  and we really hate it when people call us Shawna
label1 Just remember it's Shanna Banana not Shawna Banawna
label1 Okay but at some point in the evening I had fuckability stock
label1 I mean...  it wasn't bullish but..
label1 Okay Warren's sending over shots
label1 And you know the house rule:  If he sends over shots you've gotta do them
label1 What
label1 Warren says it we do it
label1 I love that philosophy: "Warren says it we do it.
label1 So let's do it
label1 What is it
label1 Here we go
label1 Post time
label1 Mmm
label1 Ow
label1 Now is that a tasty beverage or is that a tasty beverage

label1 Chartreuse the only liquor so good they named a color after it
label1 Not me

label1 Okay
label1 But careful where you keep that hot flame all right
label1 Drinks
label1 Shanna Banana
label1 Another bigass Long Island iced tea

label1 I just got lucky
label1 Oh hardyfuckinghar
label1 Wait a minute
label1 Why
label1 I was thinking we could make out
label1 Not even in the bar but in front of the entrance
label1 Forget it
label1 What out there
label1 It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there
label1 Not in my car it's not
label1 Look you won't get wet
label1 You know most guys wouldn't brag about that
label1 Hahaha
label1 You know what I mean
label1 Look I know you guys are going to Lake LBJ and we can't come
label1 I wanna make out
label1 Okay just stop with the whining
label1 It's not attractive
label1 Deal
label1 No no no
label1 Deal or no deal
label1 If you're gonna whine when I pull the plug in six minutes  we can just walk back inside the fucking bar right now
label1 Deal
label1 No whining
label1 And no begging
label1 When you say done it's done
label1 I'm gonna remember you said that
label1 Okay let's go
label1 Oh you got two jobs:  kiss good and make sure my hair don't get wet
label1 But what's the point
label1 They're going to Shanna's daddy's house at Lake LBJ  and it's no guys... absolutely no guys
label1 Okay so after we bring the girls drinks  in fairly rapid order but not obvious we order two more rounds of shots
label1 You think they're gonna fall for that
label1 We'll be very convincing
label1 No more fucking around
label1 We go to Jäger shots
label1 Man they're not gonna drink Jäger shots
label1 Come on dude we can at least get one shot of Jäger  down these fucking bitches' throats
label1 You never know
label1 That could be the shot that puts them past the point of "fuck it.
label1 Then all of a sudden "no guys at the lake house"  turns into "a couple of guys at the lake house.
label1 My point exactly
label1 I know I can at least get Shanna "Suck My" Banana  to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot
label1 What's Julia's sweet shot
label1 Key lime pie
label1 Even fucking Leroy Brown'd do one more for dessert
label1 I wonder if B.J
label1 brought the Bear with him
label1 ♪ Well the last time he shot him ♪  Jesus
label1 ♪ Eastbound and down ♪  Dude fucking cut himself falling out of his time machine
label1 Could I get a chicken suit for Stroker Ace please
label1 I had to get something out of the car and Nate was gentlemanly enough  to escort me with his umbrella
label1 Ah good for you Nate
label1 You see that pretty girl sitting by herself at the bar
label1 Meow
label1 She's not a hippie
label1 She might as well be a hippie
label1 Thank you Timmy boy
label1 Well do you know what just happened to her
label1 No
label1 Oh I'm sorry
label1 You were telling a story
label1 What about her
label1 Hey Warren is there anybody in this place you could vouch for to give me a ride home
label1 You've been eavesdropping
label1 Oh eavesdropping and can't help but hear
label1 So uh Icy Hot  are you offering me a ride home
label1 I'm offering you a lift if when I'm ready to leave you are too
label1 And when are you thinking about leaving
label1 Truthfully I'm not thinking about it
label1 But when I do you will be the first to know
label1 Will you be able to uh drive later
label1 I've been drinking club soda and lime all night  and now I'm building up to my big drink
label1 Which is what
label1 Virgin piña colada
label1 Why would someone who doesn't drink  spend hours at a bar drinking water
label1 A bar offers all kind of things other than alcohol
label1 Mmm
label1 Like what
label1 Women nacho grande platters  the fellowship of some fascinating individuals  like Warren here
label1 Alcohol is just a lubricant for all the individual encounters  that a barroom offers
label1 Ooh
label1 Is that cowboy wisdom
label1 I'm a stuntman
label1 But that's a very easy mistake to make
label1 How do you know my name
label1 When you were talking with Warren  couldn't help but overhear
label1 So what's your name Icy
label1 Stuntman Mike
label1 Stuntman Mike's your name
label1 You ask anybody
label1 Stuntman Mike
label1 And who the hell is Stuntman Mike

label1 Is that the girl from the billboard outside
label1 Yep
label1 She sure is a strikinglooking woman
label1 It's got gin tequila...   Look at that hair
label1 Lots of leavein conditioner
label1 Hardly
label1 But if you wanna get with uh Jungle Julia there's a real easy way to do that
label1 Really
label1 What would that be
label1 Get famous
label1 You won't have to find her
label1 She'll find you
label1 And you don't even wanna know what she did for that billboard
label1 You've earned it
label1 What did she ever do to you
label1 We went to school together from kindergarten through high school
label1 That's what she did to me
label1 She was her height right now at 12
label1 Half the guys she still fucks from the old class  she used to beat up and terrorize in the fifth grade
label1 I see
label1 And she used to beat you up and take your chocolate milk huh
label1 That pituitary case
label1 Sorry
label1 I'm built like a girl not a black man
label1 But I'd die before I ever gave Julia Lucai my chocolate milk
label1 Hey are you famous or something
label1 No no no
label1 Hey what do you do
label1 Really
label1 What I do is work my ass off to get my own record label off the ground
label1 But why that girl wanted a picture of me  is because I'm a local deejay
label1 Wait a minute
label1 You got a billboard by Big Kahuna Burger don't you
label1 Yeah
label1 Yeah
label1 Jungle Julia Lucai
label1 Stuntman Mike McKay
label1 Now my friends and I are gonna continue to get our weed on
label1 Thank you Julia
label1 But just the same no thanks
label1 Suit yourself
label1 But you know...  Aw shit
label1 Sorry
label1 It's nothing
label1 What the fuck was that
label1 Actually I do want you to have a shot
label1 You got some voucher here
label1 I asked him what movies you worked on
label1 No fucking clue
label1 Well technically I really don't know if he's ever done anything for sure
label1 Yeah well there was another actor on that show... Gary Clarke...  and I looked like him a bit
label1 Obviously before I cut myself shaving
label1 Oh I like it
label1 Well damn if you ain't so sweet you make sugar taste just like salt
label1 Anyway I did a lot of Virginians doubling Gary Clarke
label1 From that point on I specialized mostly in car stunts
label1 Yeah I did damn near the whole third season of Vegas
label1 I was Robert Urich's driving double
label1 And then Bob did another show... Gavilan  and he brought me with him on that till...  And after that...  Do you know any of these shows or people I'm talking about
label1 No
label1 No
label1 So how exactly does one become a stuntman  Stuntman Mike
label1 Well in Hollywood  anybody fool enough to throw himself down a flight of stairs  can usually find somebody to pay him for it
label1 But really I got into the business  the way most people get in the stunt business
label1 My brother got me in it
label1 Well who's your brother
label1 I'm trying to get these two shows happening in New York for November
label1 I'm ready to blaze
label1 Finally
label1 Yeah
label1 You need to catch up with us
label1 Now the party can start
label1 Anyhoo I'm sorry
label1 Will you forgive me
label1 But you have to be real nice to me for the whole rest of the time I'm here
label1 Promise
label1 Mmhmm
label1 How about your little friend
label1 You wanna bring him
label1 If you really want him to come Shanna won't mind
label1 So how about it
label1 Boys or just us girls
label1 Good idea
label1 Ladies
label1 Thanks
label1 Cheers Butterfly
label1 "The woods are lovely dark and deep  "and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep
label1 "Did you hear me Butterfly
label1 Miles to go before you sleep.
label1 Sorry Stuntman Burt...  Mike
label1 She already broke off that dance
label1 Is that true
label1 Do I frighten you
label1 Is it my scar
label1 Ah
label1 Yeah I know
label1 Sorry
label1 It's my mom's car
label1 Have you been following us
label1 No
label1 But that's what I love about Austin
label1 It's just so damn small
label1 I saw him outside of Guero's
label1 And I saw you outside Guero's too
label1 You saw my car I saw your legs
label1 So you really weren't following us
label1 I'm not following you Butterfly
label1 I just got lucky
label1 Sorry
label1 It was a onetimeonly offer  and she did it earlier this evening at Anton's
label1 How do you know
label1 I'm good that way
label1 And you look a little touchéd
label1 What's "touchéd"
label1 Wounded slightly
label1 Why should I be wounded
label1 That kind of hurt your feelings a little bit didn't it
label1 There are few things as fetching as a bruised ego  on a beautiful angel
label1 So...  how about that lap dance
label1 I think I'm gonna have to give you a rain check
label1 Well since you'll be leaving in the next couple of days  that rain check will be worthless
label1 I understand if I make you uncomfortable
label1 You're still a nice girl  and I still like you
label1 But I must warn you of something
label1 You know how people say...  "You're okay in my book"  or "In my book that's no good"
label1 And everybody I ever meet  goes in this book
label1 And now I've met you and you're going in the book
label1 Except I'm afraid I must file you...  under "chickenshit.
label1 Well I definitely couldn't file you under "chickenshit" then now could I
label1 What's your name again
label1 Stuntman Mike
label1 Well Stuntman Mike I'm Butterfly
label1 My friend Jungle Julia over here says that jukebox inside is pretty impressive
label1 Yeah it is
label1 Why don't you go get ready for your lap dance

label1 Lookin' good Cannonball Run
label1 He's just giving me a ride
label1 Have a nice ride
label1 I can hear you

label1 I can still hear you
label1 Bye
label1 Wow that's fucking scary
label1 Yeah well I wanted it to be impressive
label1 Scary tends to impress
label1 Is it safe
label1 Oh it's better than safe
label1 How do you make a car death proof
label1 Well that's what stuntmen do
label1 You've seen a movie where a car gets into some smashup  there ain't no way in hell anybody's walking away from
label1 Yeah
label1 Well how do you think they accomplish that
label1 Well unfortunately Pam nowadays more often than not you're right
label1 But back in the allornothing days the Vanishing Point days  the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days  the White Line Fever days...  real cars smashing into real cars  with real dumb people driving them
label1 So you give the stunt team the car you want to smash up  take her and reinforce that fucker everywhere  and voilà you got yourself a deathproof automobile
label1 I just didn't know you could make a car death proof
label1 Hell I can drive this baby into a brick wall  doing 125 miles an hour just for the experience
label1 Why is your passenger seat in a box
label1 Sometimes when you're shooting a crash director wants to put a camera in the car
label1 You know shoot the crash from the inside
label1 That's where you put the camera
label1 They call it a crash box
label1 There you go
label1 You know when you asked to drive me home  you didn't mention your car didn't have a passenger seat
label1 Yeah well actually I didn't ask to drive you home
label1 You asked me for a ride and I said yes
label1 But look at the bright side Pam
label1 I won't be getting fresh putting my hand on your knee
label1 I thought so
label1 Well Pam which way you going
label1 Right
label1 Ah that's too bad
label1 Why
label1 Well because there was a 5050 shot on whether you'd be going left or right
label1 You see we're both going left
label1 You could've just as easily been going left too  and if that was the case  it would've been a while before you started getting scared
label1 But since you're going the other way  I'm afraid...  you're gonna have to start getting scared... immediately
label1 What the fuck
label1 Just fucking let me out of here
label1 Okay here's the thing
label1 I get it
label1 I..
label1 Um but if you just stop right now  you know and... and... and let me out  I'll never tell anybody because I know it's a joke
label1 I know all about jokes
label1 I promise everything will be fine
label1 Just... Just... Just let me out  please and... and...  Hey Pam  remember when I said this car was death proof
label1 Well that wasn't a lie
label1 This car is 100% death proof
label1 Now I gotta catch me my other girlfriends
label1 No no no no
label1 It's Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich
label1 So you got it
label1 Thanks honey
label1 You're gonna play it next song right
label1 Growl

label1 Now you actually think that he premeditatedly murdered them gals
label1 Well I can't prove it  but since thinking don't cost nothing I can think it and I do
label1 Well hell yeah he got banged up but God damn
label1 Them pretty little gals look like a goddamn giant  chewed 'em up and spit 'em out
label1 Any of 'em survive
label1 Shit
label1 Two tons of metal 200 miles an hour  flesh and bone and plain old Newton..
label1 They all princess died
label1 Well I'd guestimate it's a sex thing
label1 The only way I can figure it
label1 Highvelocity impact  twisted metal busted glass  all four souls taken exactly at the same time
label1 Yeah I think the only thing we can dream of getting that bastard on  is vehicular manslaughter for the hitchhiker in the death box
label1 That was just plain old goddamn reckless endangerment
label1 Now on paper it's gonna look like he's just trying to help her out
label1 I mean that's the way the jury's gonna see it
label1 So what are you gonna do Pop
label1 Well I can take it upon myself to work the case you know  in my off hours
label1 Search for evidence you know to prove my theory
label1 Alert authorities
label1 Wherever he goes I go
label1 Or I can spend  the same goddamn amount of time and energy  following the NASCAR circuit
label1 Hmm
label1 I thought about it a lot
label1 I think I'd have a hell of lot happier life if I did the latter
label1 If he ever does it again  I can make goddamn sure he don't do it in Texas

label1 We made out in the hall for about 10 minutes and then I sent him off to his room
label1 Mmm he's damn good
label1 He's got them mushy lips and fingertips
label1 Mmm I love them mushy lips
label1 Then he takes his big hand and he puts it on my throat  tilts my head back and leans over me  kisses me from behind

label1 Fucking hell
label1 How does that happen
label1 Well I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup and she's off for the next three days  there's no stunts being filmed during that time so Kim's free  and Lee's on a "will notify" for the next four days
label1 Great
label1 We're having the best time
label1 The director Cecil Evans is so much fun
label1 Hell yeah
label1 The next job after this one is definitely gonna suck
label1 So let's hear it ladies
label1 Set romances
label1 Who's getting it off
label1 That would be Lee and Toolbox
label1 Name sounds promising
label1 He's a grip
label1 Well he just keeps sounding better and better
label1 What's his perversion
label1 He likes to watch me pee
label1 PISSING
label1 Yeah but not no more
label1 Now she's getting it on with The Rock
label1 You're having one off with The Rock
label1 Not the real Rock
label1 He's this electrician named Bruce
label1 And Kim started calling him The Rock 'cause he kind of looks like The Rock  so now we all just call him The Rock
label1 This is an allstar crew
label1 We got a guy who looks like Nick Cage  and a guy who looks like Peewee Herman too
label1 Kim dick department
label1 Let's hear it
label1 No dick this trip
label1 I got a man
label1 How long have you had this boyfriend
label1 Who'd you steal him from
label1 Nobody
label1 Kim
label1 Wha... What
label1 All of Kim's boyfriends start out as somebody else's boyfriend
label1 I did not steal him
label1 I didn't steal any of them
label1 They just... jumped ship
label1 Oh Abbie's got the big kahuna
label1 I had a set crush on Cecil
label1 Set crush
label1 Nigga please
label1 You were his set wife
label1 "Were" and "had" being the key words here
label1 Yeah well if he's so in love with me  then whey did he fuck Daryl Hannah's standin
label1 Yes men are dogs
label1 Oh it's so funny
label1 Oh it's so funny
label1 Oh stop acting all hurt
label1 Yeah he's a standin fucker
label1 Bitch you need to get over that shit
label1 That was two weeks ago
label1 Oh well now that you put it like that
label1 Oh I haven't told you the best part
label1 He fucked her on my birthday
label1 Oh that's a horse of a different color
label1 Did he know it was your birthday
label1 He's the director
label1 He's kind of busy
label1 He ate a piece of my birthday cake and he got me a present
label1 Well what did he get you
label1 He made me a tape
label1 Yeah
label1 Wait
label1 He made you a tape
label1 Yeah
label1 Oh that is so romantic
label1 Yes
label1 That sounds like the test of true love to me
label1 Look I know you guys like him
label1 He's likable but he fucked another woman on my birthday
label1 How can you not be on my side
label1 Well I admit that sounds bad
label1 It is bad
label1 Were you two fucking
label1 Hell no
label1 Hello
label1 Is your name Abernathy
label1 The answer to your question is no of course not
label1 What do you mean "No of course not"
label1 And if you fuck Cecil you don't become one of his girlfriends
label1 Not to say I want to be his girlfriend  but if I did want to be his girlfriend  if I fucked him I wouldn't be his girlfriend
label1 I'd be one of his regulars
label1 And I'm just getting too fucking old for that shit
label1 Yes
label1 I've let him give me a foot massage  and when we go to the movies I've let him hold my hand
label1 Bitch you might be acting like you 12 years old  but he just acting like a man
label1 You need to break that nigga off a piece
label1 You're not fucking him...  Mmmm
label1 You're not sucking him...  Mmmm
label1 You're not giving him any tongue but Daryl Hannah's standin is
label1 Okay can we just take my sex life off the table
label1 Actually uh it was Cecil's sex life that was on the table and your lack of one
label1 Ohhh
label1 Before you can claim a nigga you got to claim a nigga  and you can start by giving that motherfucker a hand job  in the back of the van on Tuesday
label1 I'm not gonna do that
label1 I know you won't
label1 But you know who will
label1 The bitch that ends up living in that bigass mansion of his
label1 Now I gotta say I haven't entirely agreed with everything Kim said but it is true:  If you stretch shit out like you have with Cecil  and you suddenly get dirty on them  it blows their mind
label1 Three Kicks to the Head Part Three
label1 And admittedly we're a little fuckedup
label1 Cheers to that
label1 Word
label1 Cheers
label1 So Zoë  the genius  wants to take a picture of me
label1 So she's got her camera and keeps saying  "Step back a little" so I do
label1 Then "A little further" so I step back a little further
label1 Then "A little more" so I do
label1 Then I realize I'm right at the edge  of a sevenfoot concrete ditch  with God knows how many rocks and broken bottles and rats in it  and if I fell in that fucking thing I'd probably would've broken my fucking neck
label1 So I'm yelling at her "Zoë you almost killed me!
label1 Nice
label1 Nice
label1 Thank you
label1 Thank you
label1 I remember taking a step and looking down
label1 Just as I'm thinking "There's that ditch Abbie was talking about"  bam I'm in the fucking ditch you know
label1 What with Zoë the cat
label1 Nothing
label1 If I fell in that fucking thing  they would've had to helicopter me out of there
label1 Zoë just lands on her feet
label1 But then later I started feeling a little bad about myself
label1 We're laughing about it
label1 If I fell in that fucking thing  I probably would've been fucking paralyzed
label1 Oh honey you can't think like that
label1 You know we all have our individual talents  and that just happens to be one of Zoë's
label1 Well...  physically speaking Zoë is amazing
label1 I mean agility reflexes nimbleness
label1 There's few human beings that can fuck with Zoë on that front
label1 Having said that  before you get too envious of Zoë's prowess  you're missing the most important part of that story
label1 You didn't fall in the ditch Zoë did
label1 Zoë even knew there was a ditch there because you told her  and she still fell in
label1 We all have our talents
label1 Hey I resemble that remark
label1 So Kim you still pack a roscoe
label1 Check it out bitch
label1 Ooh nice one mate
label1 What's a roscoe
label1 A roscoe is a pistol
label1 You carry a gun
label1 Uhhuh
label1 You have a license to carry it
label1 Yeah
label1 Oh I didn't know you were..
label1 Okay I didn't say it all right
label1 Stop looking at me
label1 I didn't say it
label1 God
label1 Now do I approve
label1 No
label1 Do I know
label1 Yes
label1 Look I don't know what futuristic utopia you live in  but the world I live in a bitch need a gun
label1 You can't get around the fact that people who carry guns  tend to get shot more than people who don't
label1 Don't do your laundry at midnight
label1 Fuck that
label1 I wanna do my laundry whenever the fuck I wanna do my laundry
label1 Pepper spray
label1 Uh motherfucker try to rape me I don't wanna give him a skin rash
label1 I wanna shut that nigga down
label1 How about a knife at least
label1 Yeah
label1 You know what happens to motherfuckers carry knives
label1 They get shot
label1 I'll hire me a dodirt nigga and he'll carry the gun
label1 And when shit goes down I'll sit back and laugh
label1 But until that day it's wild West motherfucker
label1 So Zoë you thought about what you want to do first
label1 Oh really
label1 And what would that be
label1 To me there's no point in being in America  unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car
label1 Fuck me swinging balls out
label1 Um well I guess we can talk to Transpo
label1 But does it have to be a Dodge Challenger
label1 Not just that
label1 It has to be a 1970 Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine
label1 No worries mate
label1 I've got it all worked out
label1 When I knew I was coming here I went online and found out  that the local paper here in Tennessee is the Lebanon News Sentinel
label1 I'm sorry
label1 Where's home
label1 Australia right
label1 What do you mean by that mate
label1 Zoë's from New Zealand and you never..
label1 That is unless you want your ass kicked
label1 I really am
label1 Oh it's okay
label1 We're just taking the piss out of you mate
label1 Anyway I subscribed to the local paper a month ago
label1 Now why the fuck you want a local redneck newspaper in New Zealand
label1 Pipe down and I'll tell you
label1 I've been getting the paper for the last month  and I've been checking the classified at the back looking at cars for sale
label1 And you wanna buy it
label1 Kim I may be stupid but I'm not bloody stupid
label1 I wanna say I wanna buy it so he'll let me testdrive it
label1 A 1970 Dodge Challenger with a white paint job
label1 Kowalski from Vanishing Point
label1 Mate it's a fucking classic
label1 Mmm I get it
label1 If I can get this guy to let me drive it without him  I will blow the doors off that bitch
label1 Oh God
label1 "What's Vanishing Point?
label1 Abs I'm supposed to be the illiterate one
label1 It's just one of the best American movies ever made
label1 Actually Zoë most girls wouldn't know Vanishing Point
label1 Excuse me
label1 "Most girls"
label1 What the fuck are you two
label1 Of course we watched it
label1 Y'all grew up watching that Pretty in Pink shit
label1 What so you didn't watch John Hughes movies
label1 Of course I did
label1 I'm a girl
label1 But I also watched car shit too
label1 Mmhmm
label1 Gone in 60 Seconds..
label1 The real one not that Angelina Jolie bullshit
label1 We have an outdoors theater in Auckland
label1 What do you horny gals want
label1 Hey you got a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale
label1 This shit is off the fucking hook
label1 Fucking legendary mate
label1 Sweet ass
label1 Well if you'll excuse me for a moment  I'd just like to have a word alone with my business associate
label1 You ladies take your time
label1 Okay
label1 Mmm
label1 What are you waiting for
label1 I..
label1 I intend to but first I need to ask you something
label1 What
label1 Oh hell no
label1 Would you keep it down
label1 For Christ sakes...   Don't blaspheme
label1 Sorry
label1 Now what did you say after the last time
label1 Look I know what I said...  What did you say
label1 I know I said we shouldn't do this again...  No
label1 You didn't say we shouldn't
label1 Yeah but...  "But" my ass
label1 You said not only are we never gonna play ship's mast again  but you also said if you ever do what you trying to do now  to not only refuse but that I had permission  to physically restrain your ass if necessary
label1 Well...  No no no no
label1 Answer the question motherfucker
label1 Did you or did you not say that
label1 Yes I said that
label1 However...  Whatever with your "however.
label1 Look I know I said it and I know I meant it..
label1 Damn skippy you meant it
label1 Really..
label1 I meant we should never play ship's mast again  in New Zealand or Australia
label1 You are such a liar
label1 Look I know what I said when I said it
label1 But when I said it I didn't know I'd ever come to America
label1 And when I said it if I had known I was going to come to America  and had the opportunity to play ship's mast  with a fucking Vanishing Point Challenger  I would've added a "however.
label1 Okay oddly enough I actually understood that
label1 However just because you talked yourself into some stupid shit  doesn't mean I have lost my goddamn mind
label1 You need two people to play ship's mast and I ain't playing
label1 I'll be your best friend
label1 I don't need me no best friend lives on the other side of planet Earth
label1 I'll crack your back
label1 Well of course I'll crack it anyway
label1 Whenever you want it you got it
label1 You don't even have to ask for it
label1 You just order me to do it
label1 Just be like...  "Bitch get over here and get busy.
label1 You crack my back you'll give me foot massages...  Mmhmm
label1 Mmm
label1 And after a shower you put moisturizer on my butt
label1 So we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him
label1 What
label1 I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him..
label1 I heard what you said
label1 You know you two got some fucking balls
label1 What
label1 Don't play dumbass with me
label1 I've been up all night
label1 I should be in my hotel room asleep not fucking around here on Tobacco Road
label1 But because Zoë wanted to drive some fucking Vanishing Point car I'm here
label1 Now you two got the balls to ask me... no scratch that...  tell me I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad  while the cool kids get to go out and play
label1 Bullshit on that
label1 It ain't like that
label1 Then what's it like Kim
label1 You guys are our collateral
label1 I really think one human being will be collateral enough
label1 You're not gonna wanna do what we're doing
label1 What drive a car
label1 Mmm
label1 We're doing more than that
label1 We're doing more than that
label1 Actually we're paying you a compliment  'cause we gonna do some stupid shit
label1 But that's okay
label1 We're stunt people
label1 How do you know I don't wanna do it
label1 'Cause you're a mom
label1 Yeah
label1 You know we're supposed to be this big posse  but that's the excuse you guys use  whenever you want to exclude me from something
label1 So what is it you two daredevils are doing that I'm just so uncool  I couldn't possibly understand
label1 You know we're kind of conning this guy  so maybe it's best that we don't go into detail about it while he's watching us
label1 Okay
label1 How about this
label1 I'll talk him into it
label1 How you gonna do that
label1 Eh that's my problem
label1 But don't worry
label1 He'll say yes
label1 What are you gonna do blow him
label1 No
label1 I'm gonna insinuate that Lee's gonna blow him
label1 Not really
label1 But let me handle it
label1 We got a deal
label1 Okay Mommy listen up
label1 We take you along you don't say shit
label1 You don't even say crap
label1 You just sit in the back and I don't wanna hear  a peep out of your ass you understand

label1 Okay Abbie
label1 You know just to see if we're comfortable in it
label1 Why would I do something stupid like that
label1 How do I know y'all ain't just gonna steal it

label1 Two that would be rude
label1 Three we're staying at the Days Inn in town
label1 We're registered for the next month
label1 Actually Zoë's not
label1 But Kim and I are so we're totally trackdownable
label1 Who's Kim
label1 The colored girl
label1 Kim would be the girl of color
label1 And reason number four and the most important  while we're taking the car out for a little spin  that'll give you a better opportunity to get acquainted  with our other friend Lee
label1 Why does she look kind of familiar
label1 That would be because she's a famous actress
label1 Why is she dressed like that
label1 What's a cheerleader movie
label1 A movie about cheerleaders
label1 Is it a porno movie
label1 Yes it is
label1 But don't mention it

label1 Who's that stumblin' around in the dark
label1 State your business or prepare to get winged
label1 Calm yourselves gentlemen
label1 I mean you no harm
label1 I'm simply a fellow weary traveler
label1 Whoa boy
label1 Good cold evening gentlemen
label1 Might that be you
label1 Who wants to know
label1 I'm Dr. King Schultz
label1 This is my horse Fritz
label1 What kinda doctor
label1 Now are you the Speck Brothers
label1 And did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction
label1 So what
label1 So I wish to parley with you
label1 Speak English
label1 [chuckles] Oh I'm sorry
label1 It is a second language
label1 Now amongst your inventory I've been led to believe  is a specimen I'm keen to acquire
label1 Is there one amongst you who was formerly a resident  of the Carrucan plantation
label1 Who said that
label1 What's your name
label1 Django
label1 Then you are exactly the one I'm looking for
label1 Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are
label1 Who are they
label1 Ellis
label1 Roger
label1 Sometime they call him Lil Raj
label1 Not anymore
label1 Tell me...  ...if you were to see any of these three gentlemen again   would you recognize them
label1 [man] Hey
label1 Stop talkin' to him like that
label1 Like What
label1 My good man I'm simply trying to ascertain..
label1 Speak English goddamn it
label1 I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction
label1 I don't care
label1 No sale
label1 Of course they're for sale
label1 Move it
label1 My good man did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture  or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention
label1 Last chance fancy pants
label1 Oh very well
label1 I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast  but I didn't want you to do anything rash  before you had a moment to come to your senses
label1 You shot Roscoe
label1 I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me
label1 And I do believe I have... one two three four...  ...five witnesses who can attest to that fact
label1 Damn leg's busted
label1 No doubt
label1 [man] Godfuckin'damn it
label1 As I was saying...  ...if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again you could recognize 'em
label1 Yeah
label1 Sold American
label1 Mr. Speck
label1 How much for young Django here
label1 That iron is nasty business
label1 Oh could you hold this for a moment
label1 Thank you
label1 Get up on that horse
label1 Also if I were you  I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind
label1 Nigger
label1 Don't you touch my brother's coat
label1 Goddamn it
label1 One hundred... ten... 20...  ...and five...  ...for young Django here
label1 And since he won't be needing it anymore  I'd like to purchase your brother's nag
label1 Do you have one
label1 You go to hell dentist
label1 [scoffs]  I thought not
label1 No worries
label1 I come prepared
label1 Thank you
label1 This will serve nicely as a bill of sale
label1 Now as to you poor devils
label1 So as I see it when it comes to the subject of what to do next  you gentlemen have two choices
label1 One: Once I'm gone you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck  then carry him to the nearest town
label1 Which would be at least 37 miles back the way you came
label1 Or two: You could unshackle yourselves take that rifle  put a bullet in his head bury the two of them deep  and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country
label1 Oh and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you  the North Star is that one
label1 Tata
label1 Let's talk about this
label1 [lantern crashing]  [chains rattling]  You gotta be reasonable in a situation like this
label1 I'm just doin' my job
label1 Blueberry didn't I give you my last apple
label1 Tell you what boys: Take me to the doc in El Paso   I'll get you your freedom
label1 [gun cocking]   No
label1 No please...  [gunshot echoing]    All right now
label1 I'd like you to take two of these tonight...   [coughing]  ...and then in the morning...  That's a nigger on a horse
label1 What's everybody staring at
label1 They ain't never seen no nigger on a horse before
label1 Good morning innkeeper
label1 Two beers for two weary travelers
label1 It's still a bit early
label1 By then we'll be servin' breakfast
label1 the hell you think you're doing boy
label1 Get that nigger outta here
label1 [panting] Help
label1 Help
label1 Alas
label1 Now we must act as our own bartender
label1 Sit down my boy
label1 What kind of dentist are you
label1 But these days I practice a new profession...  ...bounty hunter
label1 Do you know what a bounty hunter is
label1 No
label1 Well...  ...the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash  a bounty hunter deals in corpses
label1 Prost
label1 The state places a bounty on a man's head
label1 I track that man I find that man I kill that man
label1 Sometimes that's easier said than done
label1 I show that corpse to the authorities proving yes indeed  I truly have killed him  at which point the authorities pay me the bounty
label1 So like slavery it's a flesh for cash business
label1 What's a bounty
label1 You kill people
label1 Certain people yeah
label1 Bad people
label1 Ah
label1 Badder they are bigger the reward
label1 And I must admit I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you
label1 On one hand I despise slavery
label1 On the other hand I need your help
label1 If you're not in a position to refuse all the better
label1 So for the time being I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey  work to my benefit
label1 Still having said that I feel guilty
label1 So I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement
label1 I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers
label1 But you do
label1 Don't ya
label1 Good
label1 So here's my agreement
label1 You travel with me until we find them
label1 Where we goin'
label1 I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg  but I don't know where
label1 That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find 'em
label1 You do that I agree to give you your freedom  $25 per Brittle Brother
label1 That's $75
label1 And as if on cue here comes the sheriff
label1 OK boys
label1 Come on out
label1 [overlapping chatter]  All right folks calm down
label1 Go about your business
label1 Now why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble
label1 You ain't got nothing better to do  than to come into Bill Sharp's town  and show your ass
label1 [metal springing noise]  [sheriff screaming]   [crowd gasping]  [groaning]    What'd you just do to our sheriff
label1 [groaning]   [yelling]  [shot echoing]    Now you can get the marshal
label1 Should we wait inside
label1 Can we just leave
label1 After you
label1 I want six men six rifles behind it
label1 I want two men two rifles up on this roof
label1 All the barrels aimed at that front door
label1 Somebody get poor Bill outta the goddamn street
label1 You in the saloon
label1 We got a hundred rifles aimed at every way out of that buildin'
label1 You got one chance to get out of this alive
label1 You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head  and I mean right now
label1 Yes it is
label1 This is U.S
label1 Marshal Gill Tatum
label1 Na wunderbar marshal
label1 I have relieved myself of all weapons  and just as you have instructed  I am ready to step outside  with my hands raised above my head
label1 You mean like you did our sheriff
label1 Shot him down like a dog in the street
label1 Yes that's exactly what I mean
label1 Do I have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street
label1 Fair enough marshal
label1 They're a little tense out there
label1 So don't make any quick movements and let me do the talking
label1 [doors squeaking open]  Come ahead
label1 You unarmed
label1 Marshal Tatum may I address you and your deputies  and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey  as to the incident that just occurred
label1 Go on
label1 Thank you
label1 Like yourself marshal I'm a servant of the court
label1 The man lying dead in the dirt who the good people of Daughtrey  saw fit to elect as their sheriff who went by the name of Bill Sharp  is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck  with a price on his head of $200
label1 The hell you say
label1 I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news
label1 But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff  sometime in the past two years
label1 Yeah
label1 years ago he was rustling cattle  from the B.C
label1 Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock Texas
label1 You're encouraged to wire him
label1 He'll back up who I am and who your dear departed sheriff was
label1 In other words marshal you owe me $200
label1 After this Brittle business is behind us  you'll be a free man with a horse $75 in your back pocket...  What's your plan after that
label1 Find my wife and buy her freedom
label1 Django I had no idea you were a married man
label1 Do most slaves believe in marriage
label1 Oh me and my wife do
label1 Old Man Carrucan didn't
label1 Django Django  You got sand Django
label1 Boy's got sand
label1 I got no use for a nigger with sand
label1 And the girl too
label1 And I want you to take 'em to the Greenville auction and sell 'em
label1 Both of 'em
label1 And this one...  ...you will sell him cheap
label1 In Greenville...  ...there should be some sort of a records office
label1 You know when she was sold...  ...you know where she came from  and you know her name
label1 What is her name
label1 Broomhilda
label1 Broomhilda
label1 Broomhilda
label1 Hmmm
label1 Were her owners German
label1 She wasn't born on the Carrucan plantation
label1 She was raised by a German mistress the Von Shafts
label1 She speak a little German too
label1 Hmmm
label1 When she was little her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody  to speak German with
label1 Well let me get this straight
label1 Your slave wife speaks German and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft
label1 Yep
label1 They call me Hildi
label1 You'll be playing a character
label1 Hm
label1 No
label1 Do you understand
label1 Yeah
label1 Don't break character
label1 And your character is that of The Valet
label1 What that is
label1 Hmmm
label1 And now Django you may choose your character's costume
label1 Youse gonna let me pick out my own clothes
label1 But of course
label1 resumes playing]  Whoa
label1 It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory
label1 My valet does not walk
label1 I said niggers on horses...  [Schultz] His name is Django
label1 He's a free man
label1 He can ride what he pleases
label1 Not on my property
label1 My good sir perhaps we got off on the wrong boot
label1 Allow me to unring this bell
label1 My name is Dr. King Schultz
label1 And these are our horses Tony and Fritz
label1 [snorting]  [women giggling]  Mr. Bennett
label1 I've been led to believe that you are a gentleman and a businessman
label1 I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals
label1 You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee  to buy one of my nigger gals
label1 No appointment no nothin'
label1 Well what if I was to say I don't like you
label1 Or your fancypants nigger
label1 And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn
label1 Now what you got to say about that
label1 Mr. Bennett
label1 If you are the businessman I've been led to believe you to be  I have 5000 things I might say that could change your mind
label1 Hmmm
label1 Oh maybe while we discuss business  you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures  to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds
label1 Oh well absolutely
label1 Yessir Big Daddy
label1 Uh...  What's your Jimmie's name again
label1 <i>'</i> Django

label1 Everybody calm down
label1 We mean no one else any harm
label1 Who are you two jokers
label1 The man to my left is Django Freeman
label1 He's my deputy
label1 In my pocket is a warrant  signed by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas  for the arrest and capture dead or alive  of John Brittle Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle
label1 They were goin' by the name Shaffer
label1 You know them by the name of Shaffer but the butchers' real name was Brittle
label1 These are wanted men
label1 The law wants 'em for murder
label1 Now may I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it
label1 Gimme
label1 Satisfied
label1 May I have that back please

label1 Now unless they start shootin' first nobody shoot 'em
label1 That's way too simple for these jokers
label1 We're gonna whup that niggerlover to death
label1 And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself
label1 Damn
label1 I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing
label1 We ready or what
label1 [fabric ripping]  Oh... Oh shit
label1 I just made it worse
label1 Willard's wife
label1 Well make your own goddamn masks
label1 Look nobody's sayin' they don't appreciate what Jenny did
label1 Well if all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag  I coulda cut it better than this
label1 What about you Robert
label1 Not too good
label1 I mean if I don't move my head I can see you pretty good more or less
label1 But when I start ridin' the bag's movin' all over and I'm ridin' blind
label1 Shit
label1 [man] Yeah
label1 Oh God
label1 Anybody bring any extra bags
label1 I'm just askin'
label1 Do we have to wear 'em when we ride
label1 Oh well shitfire
label1 If you don't wear 'em as you ride up that just defeats the purpose
label1 Well I can't see in this fuckin' thing
label1 Well fuck all y'all
label1 I'm goin' home
label1 Now I watched my wife work all day gettin' 30 bags together  for you ungrateful sonsabitches  and all I can hear is criticize criticize criticize
label1 From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'
label1 We got a killer nigger over that hill there
label1 And we gotta make a lesson out of him
label1 OK I'm confused
label1 I think we all think the bag was a nice idea
label1 Yeah
label1 [mumbling agreements]  But not pointin' any fingers they coulda been done better
label1 So how 'bout no bags this time  but next time we do the bags right and then we go full regalia
label1 I like that idea a lot
label1 Wait a minute
label1 I didn't say no bags
label1 But nobody can see
label1 So
label1 So it'd be nice to see
label1 This is a raid
label1 I can't see you can't see
label1 All that matters is can the fuckin' horse see
label1 That's a raid
label1 [overlapping shouts]  [man] Sons of bitches
label1 out from under that wagon
label1 And get that niggerlover outta the wagon
label1 That nigger ain't down here Big Daddy
label1 They tricked us

label1 Would you care to
label1 He's getting away
label1 I got him
label1 Big Daddy's getting away
label1 I got him
label1 [slowmotion impact sound]  [Big Daddy grunting]  Got him
label1 How you know Broomhilda's first masters was German
label1 Broomhilda is a German name
label1 If they named her it stands to reason they'd be German
label1 Broomhilda is the name of a character  in the most popular of all the German legends
label1 There's a story about Broomhilda
label1 Oh yes there is
label1 Oh every German knows that story
label1 Well Broomhilda was a princess
label1 She was a daughter of Wotan god of all gods
label1 Anyway her father is really mad at her
label1 What she do
label1 I can't exactly remember
label1 She disobeys him in some way
label1 So he puts her on top of the mountain
label1 Broomhilda's on a mountain
label1 And he puts a firebreathing dragon there to guard the mountain
label1 And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire
label1 Unless a hero arises brave enough to save her
label1 Does a fella arise
label1 Yes Django as a matter of fact he does
label1 A fella named Siegfried
label1 Does Siegfried save her
label1 Quite spectacularly so
label1 And he walks through hellfire...  ...because Broomhilda's worth it
label1 I know how he feel
label1 I think I'm just starting to realize that
label1 Now look Django..
label1 ...I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love...  ...but I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscience
label1 A slave auction town in Mississippi isn't the place for you to visit
label1 But let me ask you a question
label1 How do you like the bounty hunting business
label1 Kill white folks and they pay you for it
label1 What's not to like
label1 Now I have to admit we make a good team
label1 I thought you was mad at me for killin' Big John and Lil Raj
label1 What you mean "partner up"
label1 You work with me through the winter till the snow melts..
label1 ...I give you a third of my bounties
label1 So we make some money this winter and when the snow melts  I'll take you to Greenville myself  and we'll find where they sent your wife
label1 Why you care what happen to me
label1 Why you care if I find my wife
label1 ...I've never given anybody their freedom before
label1 And now that I have I feel vaguely responsible for you
label1 As a German I'm obliged to help you on your quest  to rescue your beloved Broomhilda
label1 Ooh
label1 What happened to Mr. "I Wanna Shoot White Folks For Money"
label1 His son's with him
label1 Well good
label1 He'll have a loved one with him
label1 Maybe even share a last word
label1 That's better than most of them get
label1 Put down the rifle
label1 Don't worry I'm not mad at you
label1 Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill
label1 Consider that today's lesson
label1 Dead or alive
label1 Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall   [Schultz] Gang

label1 "Dandy Michaels Gerald Nash and..."  Crazy Craig Koons
label1 That is who Smitty Bacall is
label1 If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22  they would never have printed that
label1 Do you want to save your wife by doing what I do
label1 This is what I do
label1 I kill people and sell their corpses for cash
label1 This corpse is worth $7000
label1 Now quit your pussyfooting and shoot him
label1 Pa
label1 Pa
label1 Why
label1 It's good luck
label1 You always keep the handbill of your first bounty
label1 That's accurate
label1 Who the hella you got there
label1 Who the hell is the WilsonLowe Gang
label1 Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes
label1 Huh
label1 Well just leave 'em out here they ain't going nowhere
label1 Why don't you come in then out of the snowy snow  and get yourselves some coffee
label1 We had a birthday yesterday
label1 Pretty good
label1 Move it boy
label1 Get on up on that auction block

label1 Calvin Candie
label1 He owns the fourth biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi: Candyland
label1 Candyland
label1 Oh so you've heard of it
label1 Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland
label1 Well apparently that's where your wife is...   [sighs]  ...and that's the repellant gentleman  who owns her
label1 Oh no she ain't no field nigger
label1 She... she pretty
label1 And she talk good too
label1 [sizzling]  [screaming]  She ain't no field nigger but she ain't good enough  for the house no more either
label1 What's a comfort...
label1 Oh
label1 Not while I got freedom
label1 Not while I got my gun
label1 So do we offer to buy her
label1 So...  ...say...  ...a man wants to buy a horse
label1 Needs to buy a horse
label1 And do you know what the farmer says
label1 The farmer says no
label1 Well I say fuck that farmer and I'm stealin' that horse
label1 Fair enough
label1 But now you're a horse thief and they hang horse thieves
label1 We need her and we need a bill of sale
label1 May I offer an alternative plan of action
label1 Go ahead
label1 So... the man walks up to the farmer's farm  he knocks on the farmer's door...  ...and asks not to buy the horse but the farm
label1 We gonna offer to buy Candyland
label1 No it's far too big
label1 But apparently this farmer ain't all about the farm
label1 How much do you know about Mandingo fighting
label1 What
label1 Can you convincingly masquerade as someone  who is an expert on Mandingo fighting
label1 Why
label1 "</i>  Bonjour
label1 We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie
label1 <i>Entraz.</i>   Thank you
label1 Hmmm
label1 Ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver

label1 Ain't nothin' nobody is sellin' is worth buyin'
label1 I'm curious... what makes you such a Mandingo expert

label1 Can I get you a tasty refreshment
label1 Yes
label1 I'll have a beer
label1 Wunderbar
label1 Do not spare the rum
label1 Doc..
label1 You are well you are a neophyte
label1 I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this cowboy here is takin' advantage of you
label1 ...I didn't seek you out for your advice
label1 I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger  at above topdollar market price
label1 Now I was under the impression when you granted me an audience  it would be to discuss business
label1 Well we weren't talkin' business yet
label1 We were discussin' my curiosity
label1 Thank you
label1 go outside and play
label1 I know you didn't mean me
label1 Prost
label1 German
label1 Now according to Moguy if I do business with you  I'm doing business with both y'all
label1 Is that it
label1 Well you don't make it sound too flattering but more or less yeah
label1 Hm
label1 So..
label1 Not for top dollar
label1 Well then we got nothin' more to talk about
label1 He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell
label1 He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell
label1 Well I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell
label1 Well you won't sell your best
label1 You won't even sell your second best
label1 But your third best...
label1 You don't want to sell him either
label1 And what do you consider ridiculous
label1 For a truly talented specimen the right nigger
label1 Twelve thousand dollars
label1 Well gentlemen you had my curiosity  but now you have my attention
label1 Willie
label1 Hold up
label1 Hold up
label1 Ah
label1 Good morning gentlemen
label1 Good Dr. Schultz
label1 Beautiful morning isn't it
label1 Please won't you take a ride with us here in the Victoria
label1 Oh thank you very much
label1 You can tie your horse up back there
label1 Where I part company from many of my phrenologist colleagues  is I believe there is a level above bright above talented  above loyal that a nigger can aspire to
label1 Say one nigger that just pops up in 10000
label1 Bright day huh Bright Boy
label1 Sun is up
label1 Shining on all of us
label1 [Schultz] Thank you
label1 Quite an honor
label1 The honor is all ours
label1 Thank you
label1 Bright Boy you are that one in 10000
label1 The name of the game is keep up not catch up nigger
label1 Whoa
label1 Everybody calm down
label1 Now I saw the whole thing
label1 No harm done
label1 This nigger just..
label1 I said no harm done
label1 Now take your hand off your pistol
label1 Butch that means you too
label1 Everybody stop antagonizing my guest
label1 Hoot
label1 Get back up on your horse
label1 For God's sake somebody please help Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse
label1 [man] Yessir boss
label1 Oh now you are one lucky nigger
label1 Oh I'm gonna go walking in the moonlight with you
label1 You wanna hold my hand
label1 Head 'em out
label1 You got a problem with your eyeball boy
label1 No sir
label1 You want a boot heel in it
label1 No sir
label1 You flash that bad look at me again I'll give you a reason not to like me
label1 Now move nigger
label1 You niggers are gonna understand something about me
label1 I'm worse than any of these white men here
label1 You get the molasses out your ass you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me
label1 [chuckles]  Indeed
label1 You know I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimens at Candyland  so before that moment it would be good if I could have  a confidential strategy meeting with my confidant
label1 You mind telling me what the hell you doing
label1 I confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland
label1 You're sure it's her
label1 He didn't call her by name  but she's a young lady whip marks on her back and speaks German
label1 Now while it's not wise to assume  in this instance I think it's pretty safe
label1 Point being don't get so carried away with your retribution
label1 You lose sight of why we're here
label1 Yes I do
label1 Stop antagonizing Candie
label1 And I for one don't intend to die in Chickasaw County Mississippi USA
label1 I'm not antagonizing him
label1 You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves
label1 I recall the man who had me kill another man in front of his son  and he didn't bat a eye
label1 You remember that
label1 Yeah of course I remember
label1 What you said was that this is my world...  ...and in my world you gotta get dirty
label1 I'm gettin' dirty
label1 Well you're paraphrasing a tad but...  ...that was the general gist
label1 See you at Candyland
label1 That means you too Moonlight
label1 Now boy why do a fool thing like run off
label1 I can't fight no more Monsieur Candie
label1 You might not be able to win but your ass can fight
label1 Mr. Stonesipher would you please shut these goddamn dogs up
label1 I cannot hear myself think
label1 Marsha hush up
label1 Marsha
label1 Hey
label1 Get these goddamn dogs away from this nigger
label1 Come on now boy... get on out that tree
label1 Yessir
label1 How long was he loose
label1 A night
label1 Day
label1 Half the other night
label1 'Bout 20 miles off the prop
label1 Pretty far considering that limp he got
label1 Mr. Moguy who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday
label1 Onea this new lot
label1 Well way he looks now a blind Indian wouldn't bet a bead on him
label1 Candie I ain't got it in me no more
label1 Now now now now now
label1 I can't...  Now no beggin'
label1 You in trouble now son
label1 Yessir
label1 When I pay $500 then I expect to get five fights out of a nigger   'fore he roll over and play dead
label1 Sir
label1 You fought three fights
label1 But I won every one
label1 Yes you did
label1 Yes you did
label1 But that last one you muddled the line between winnin' and losin'
label1 Yessir
label1 Still the fact remains:  I pay $500 I want five goddamn fights
label1 So what about my $500 huh
label1 You gonna reimburse me
label1 You even know what "reimburse" means
label1 I'll reimburse you
label1 You Will
label1 Yep
label1 You'll pay $500  for practically a oneeyed old Joe ain't fit to push a broom
label1 No he won't
label1 Matter of fact so am I
label1 But we ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny
label1 Ain't got no use for him
label1 You heard him
label1 You're gonna have to excuse Mr. Stonesipher's slackjawed gaze
label1 He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life
label1 Ain't that right Mr. Stonesipher
label1 ...nor have I
label1 Now...  ...seein' as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here...  ...you won't mind me handlin' this nigger any way I see fit
label1 Mr. Stonesipher
label1 Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven
label1 Marsha
label1 Marsha hey get him
label1 [barks echoing]  Get 'im get 'im
label1 Yeah
label1 Whoo
label1 Whooee
label1 Nah he just ain't used to seein' a man ripped apart by dogs is all
label1 You are used to it
label1 I'm just a little more used to Americans than he is
label1 Hm
label1 Now Monsieur Candie...  ...whenever you're ready
label1 Let's get to it
label1 'Cause as of now if he's an example I ain't impressed
label1 Follow me
label1 Line 'em up to the left here now boy

label1 Yessir
label1 I understand
label1 Wellgood
label1 Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready
label1 He gonna stay in The Big House
label1 Stephen he's a slaver
label1 It's different
label1 In The Big House
label1 Well you got a problem with that
label1 Oh no
label1 I ain't got no problem with it  if you ain't got no problem with burnin' the bed the sheets  the pillowcases everything else when this blackass motherfucker's gone
label1 They are mine to burn
label1 Now your problem right now is makin' a good impression
label1 Yessir Monsieur Candie
label1 Go on now
label1 Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in The Big House
label1 Your daddy rollin' over in his goddamned grave
label1 Man the lip on him
label1 He's gettin' worse and worse
label1 Now...  Where is my beautiful sister?
label1 There she is
label1 Whoohoohoohoo
label1 Dr. Schultz this attractive Southern belle is my widowed sister
label1 Chester Rodney Chicken Charly
label1 Y'all get your ass over by that pen
label1 Come on Charly
label1 Come on now
label1 You know where it is
label1 Like you on a rope
label1 Niggers don't walk around here niggers run
label1 Monsieur Candie
label1 Hm
label1 Yeah
label1 About that matter about the nigger girl you were talking about
label1 Yeah I believe you mentioned she spoke German
label1 Ah yes
label1 Hildi what about her
label1 Do you think before the demonstration you could send her around to my room
label1 I don't see why not
label1 Actually Monsieur Candie sir  there'sa somethin' I ain't told you 'bout yet
label1 What
label1 [stammers] Uh Hildi in the Hot Box
label1 She bein' punished
label1 [Calvin] What she do
label1 [Stephen] She run off again
label1 Two
label1 When did she go
label1 Last night
label1 They brung her back this morning
label1 they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass
label1 Bill and Cody went lookin' for her found her brung her back
label1 Now she a little beatup
label1 How long she been in the box
label1 she been in there
label1 All damn day
label1 And the little bitch got ten more days to be in there
label1 Take her out
label1 Why
label1 Because I said so that's why
label1 Dr. Schultz is my guest
label1 Hildi is my nigger
label1 But Monsieur Candie she run off
label1 Jesus Christ Stephen
label1 What is the point of havin' a nigger that speaks German  if you can't wheel 'em out when you have a German guest
label1 Now I realize it is inconvenient but still you take her ass out
label1 Yessir
label1 Now gentlemen I do apologize but I am weary from our travels beyond words
label1 It is time for me to rest my tired eyes
label1 Y'all done heard the man
label1 Cora
label1 Come here
label1 Shoots
label1 Schultz
label1 Schultz
label1 Get her back over here
label1 Yessir
label1 [soft guitar music plays]   Come on girl
label1 Stand up
label1 Is you comin' with me or is you gonna sleep in that little box over yonder
label1 Hello ladies
label1 Dr. Schultz
label1 May I introduce to you Broomhilda
label1 Hildi this is Dr. Schultz
label1 Well it's not every nigger speaks German don't ya know
label1 [chuckles]  [forced chuckle]  As I look at you now Broomhilda  I can see all the passions you inspire are completely justified
label1 The doctor here speaks German
label1 And I've been informed you do as well
label1 Go ahead girl
label1 Speak a little German
label1 Ha
label1 [laughs]  Astonishing
label1 <i>Ja.</i>   Don't be afraid
label1 Pardon
label1 <i>Danke.</i>    Hey Little Trouble Maker
label1 You silvertongued devil you
label1 Hurry up girl
label1 These ready Miss Cora
label1 No no no they drinkin' tonight
label1 Get your big pretty ass out the way
label1 you knows what I like
label1 Ooh
label1 Come on with these biscuits girl
label1 Look Monsieur Candie they were all fine specimens no doubt about it
label1 But the best three by far were Samson...   What's that other one's name
label1 Goldie
label1 Goldie
label1 By the way why is he called Eskimo Joe
label1 these nigger nicknames get started
label1 His name was Joe maybe one day he said he was cold
label1 Well regardless Samson's your best
label1 We all know that
label1 You will never sell him and I can see why
label1 He's a champion
label1 All three are champions
label1 Samson's the champion
label1 Them other two pretty good
label1 Calvin now what's this nigger you let..
label1 You have to understand Monsieur Candie  while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game  I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus
label1 Is that right
label1 Hence I have big ideas when it comes to presentation
label1 I need something more than just a big nigger
label1 Yeah he needs to have panache
label1 Need to have what
label1 What
label1 Panache
label1 Showmanship yes
label1 I want to be able to bill him as The Black Hercules
label1 The Black Hercules isn't that clever
label1 More like Niggerles
label1 Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger per se
label1 But is he right as rain
label1 Oh Dr. Schultz  I will have you know there is no one in the nigger fight game  that appreciates the value of showmanship  more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie here
label1 Nobody
label1 Hmmm
label1 And that is a nigger that can win fights
label1 Now that should be your first second third fourth and fifth concern
label1 Now after you have that and you know you have that  then you can start to implement a grand design
label1 In other words first thing is first
label1 First thing's first
label1 Ooh
label1 Famously
label1 Oh Monsieur Candie you can't imagine what it's like  not to hear your native tongue in four years
label1 Well hell I can't imagine two weeks in Boston
label1 Two weeks in Boston
label1 [coughing]   I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue
label1 And Hildi is a charming conversation companion
label1 Dr. Schultz
label1 You mighta caught yourself   a little dose of nigger love
label1 a powerful emotion boy
label1 [Stephen] Hm
label1 It's like a pool of black tar
label1 Once it catches your ass you're caught
label1 Yessir you stuck
label1 Well naturally
label1 It is the soaring eagle that attracts her attention   not the plucked chicken
label1 [all chuckle]  so down on yourself
label1 you got to put your elbow in these dishes you hear me
label1 You know that nigger don't you
label1 Who
label1 "Who?
label1 You know who I'm talkin' about
label1 At the table
label1 I don't know him
label1 No
label1 "No" what
label1 No sir
label1 You wouldn't lie to me now would you
label1 If you say so
label1 Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger no doubt about it
label1 But if it was my money I wouldn't pay no $12000 for him
label1 What would your price be
label1 Well if I was inclined to be generous...  ...and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous...  ...9000
label1 Dr. Schultz let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about
label1 You see it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger
label1 Sure wasn't
label1 It was you who approached me to buy one
label1 Sure was
label1 Now that $9000 figure  Bright Boy's been bandyin' about that ain't too far off from right
label1 And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that   I could do so any day of the week
label1 But like you said in Greenville doctor..
label1 It was only your ridiculous offer of $12000   that made me even consider it
label1 Hmmm
label1 You know Monsieur Candie you do possess the power of persuasion
label1 Monsieur Candie you have a deal
label1 Eskimo Joe $12000
label1 [banging table] Hooray doctor
label1 Hooray
label1 However that is a tremendous amount of money
label1 Persnickety man named Tuttle
label1 And I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract  before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh
label1 Hmmm
label1 Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined   by a physician of my choosing
label1 [Calvin] Naturally
label1 So say I return in about...   ...five days time
label1 With my Mr. Tuttle
label1 I say splendid doctor
label1 Splendid
label1 Gentlemen...  ...may I propose a toast
label1 To Eskimo Joe
label1 [all chuckling]  To The Black Hercules
label1 To The Black Hercules
label1 You was right doctor
label1 That name do have panass
label1 [chuckles]  Hm
label1 So Hildi how you like servin' at the big table in The Big House huh
label1 When Monsieur Candie talk to you you answers
label1 I like it a lot Monsieur Candie
label1 It's a lot better than sizzlin' in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass  through a bramble bush
label1 But maybe it's not quite as much fun as gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos   huh sugar bear
label1 Oh Lord she like them niggers
label1 Sure do
label1 Like Samson
label1 You know Monsieur Candie  the doctor here might be interested in seein' Hildi's peeled back  seein' as how they don't have many niggers where he come from
label1 Dr. Schultz when you was alone with Hildi here  did you just speak German or did you get to take her clothes off
label1 No we just talked and...  haven't seen her back
label1 I haven't...  No no no no
label1 Stephen's right you might find this interesting
label1 Hildi go on take off your dress
label1 Go on
label1 [Lara Lee] Uh Calvin
label1 Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf
label1 They don't got niggers there
label1 He is a man of medicine
label1 These niggers are tough Dr. Schultz no doubt about it
label1 Hildi's got somethin' like four lashes on her back
label1 Lara Lee just get one she'd lose her goddamn mind
label1 [Stephen] Sure would
label1 [Calvin] Look at that doctor
label1 It's like a paintin'
label1 Look at that
label1 We are eating
label1 [exhales]  Fine
label1 Fine fine fine fine
label1 After dinner then Stephen
label1 After dinner
label1 During the brandies gentlemen hm
label1 [Lara Lee] She a mess
label1 Yes ma'am
label1 [gasps] Oh
label1 I just got you done up
label1 Come on in here
label1 Baby you on Stephen bad side and you need to be on his blind side
label1 You say you ain't know him
label1 Huh
label1 I said you said you ain't know him
label1 I don't
label1 Mr. Stephen..
label1 ...I don't
label1 Why is you lying to me
label1 I ain't
label1 Then why is you crying
label1 Why is I'm scaring you
label1 Because you scary
label1 that warms my heart to hear that
label1 You stay right here
label1 you'd be willing to part with Hildi
label1 Whyyes
label1 Yessiree bob I did
label1 In that case allow me to propose another proposition
label1 Hurry up goddamn it
label1 Monsieur Candie...  [Calvin] Stephen
label1 You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here
label1 Excuse him
label1 Monsieur Candie could I get a word with you in the kitchen
label1 You mean get up out of my chair
label1 Why
label1 It's about dessert
label1 I'd rather discuss that in private
label1 We're having white cake
label1 What sort of melodrama could be brewing back there
label1 You right Monsieur Candie
label1 You right
label1 I'll handle it myself
label1 Shit get fucked up around here you blame me
label1 Fine
label1 Fine
label1 Yessir
label1 Well gentlemen as you can see  talented as they are no doubt in the kitchen  from time to time adult supervision is required
label1 If you'll excuse me a moment
label1 the dinner service
label1 Hurry up girl
label1 So Dr. Schultz why don't you regale us with a tale of the circus
label1 What is the matter
label1 They wants that girl
label1 [chuckling]  Stephen what the hell are you talking about
label1 Hm
label1 They playing your ass for a fool is what I'm talking about
label1 They ain't here for no musclebound Jimmie
label1 Wh... What girl
label1 Hildi
label1 Yeah Hildi
label1 Her and Django them niggers know each other
label1 Did he give you any money
label1 No
label1 Not yet
label1 But...  Then he ain't bought diddly
label1 Not yet nohow
label1 But he's just about to buy  who he come here to buy when I interrupted him
label1 "Thank you Stephen.
label1 Where you gettin' all this
label1 Why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger  with a chewed up back ain't worth $300
label1 They doin' it 'cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi
label1 She probably his wife
label1 You wouldn't pay no never mind to no $300
label1 But that 12000
label1 That made you real friendly now didn't it
label1 Yes it did
label1 His wife huh
label1 If it had been a snake it would have bit me
label1 Those lying...  ...goddamn timewastin' sons of bitches
label1 Sons of bitches
label1 Oh there you are
label1 I was beginning to think that you and that old crow run off together
label1 That'd be a hell of a note wouldn't it
label1 Billy Crash is out there dealing with some shady slaver  trying to sell a passel of ponies
label1 Would you be a dear go out there and give them gals an eyeball
label1 Of course brother
label1 Thank you darling
label1 Yeah
label1 Business never sleeps
label1 Apropos before your exit  we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda
label1 Ah yes
label1 Yes we were doctor
label1 And we will again
label1 Who's your little friend
label1 This is Ben
label1 He's a old Joe that lived around here for a long time
label1 And I do mean a long damn time
label1 Old Ben here took care of my daddy...  ...and my daddy's daddy
label1 Growing up the son of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi  puts a white man in contact with a whole lotta black faces
label1 I spent my whole life here right here in Candyland...  ...surrounded by black faces
label1 [laughs]  Now right out there on that porch three times a week for 50 years  Old Ben here would shave my daddy with a straight razor
label1 Now if I was Old Ben I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat  and it wouldn't have taken me no 50 years to do it neither
label1 But he never did
label1 Why not
label1 You see the science of phrenology  is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species
label1 In the skull of the African here  the area associated with submissiveness  is larger than any human or any other subhuman species on planet Earth
label1 If you examine...  ...this piece of skull here...  ...you will notice three distinct dimples
label1 Here here and here
label1 But this is the skull of Old Ben
label1 Now Bright Boy..
label1 ...I will admit you are pretty clever
label1 But if I took this hammer here...  ...and I bashed in your skull with it...  ...you would have the same three dimples in the same place...  ...as Old Ben
label1 Hey
label1 If you lift those palms off that turtle shell tabletop  Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawedoff
label1 There have been a lot of lies said around this dinner table here tonight  but that you can believe
label1 Mr. Moguy would you be so kind as to collect the pistol  hanging off these boys' hips here
label1 Thank you ever so much
label1 Doctor
label1 Jackass
label1 Ah yes
label1 Am I right
label1 Right
label1 Bring out Hildi
label1 Get over there yonder
label1 [screams]  Sit your ass in that goddamn...  flat on that tabletop
label1 To which me myself said "What is your definition of ridiculous?
label1 To which you said "$12000.
label1 [yells]  Now considering y'all  have ridden a whole lot of miles  went through a whole lot of trouble and done spread a whole lot of bull  to purchase this lovely lady right here  it would appear that Broomhilda is in fact... the right nigger
label1 And if y'all want to leave Candyland with Broomhilda  the price is $12000
label1 Yes I do doctor
label1 You see under the laws of Chickasaw County  Broomhilda here is my property
label1 And I can choose to do with my property whatever I so desire
label1 And if y'all think my price...  ...for this nigger here is too steep...   [grunts]  ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...  ...take this goddamn hammer here and beat her ass to death with it
label1 Right in front of both y'all

label1 D'Artagnan
label1 And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this
label1 Come again
label1 Alexandre Dumas
label1 Yes of course doctor
label1 I figured you must be an admirer
label1 You named your slave after his novel's lead character
label1 Now if Alexandre Dumas had been there today  I wonder what he would have made of it
label1 Yes
label1 His approval would be a dubious proposition at best
label1 Softhearted Frenchie
label1 Alexandre Dumas is black
label1 Are these Broomhilda's papers

label1 One more moment doctor

label1 It's a custom here in the South...  ...once a business deal is concluded that the two parties shake hands
label1 I'm not from the South
label1 But you are...  ...in my house doctor
label1 So I'm afraid I must insist
label1 On what
label1 That I shake your hand
label1 Oh then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction
label1 What you think I am
label1 No I don't
label1 I think you are a bad loser
label1 And I think you're an abysmal winner
label1 Nevertheless here in Chickasaw County a deal ain't done  until the two parties have shook hands
label1 Even after all that paper signin' don't mean shit...  ...you don't shake my hand
label1 If I don't shake your hand you're gonna throw away $12000
label1 Mr. Pooch
label1 If she tries to leave here before this niggerloving German shakes my hand  you cut her ass down

label1 next to America's hottest old car
label1 That's the car I own
label1 Are you listenin' to me
label1 Goddamn shit
label1 Are you listening to me
label1 That's a 1964 niggerred ragtop Chevy Chevelle
label1 And I love that car more than l love hips lips or fingertips
label1 Cut to: We're sittin' here celebratin' gettin' high   drinking champagne  Drinking Cristal
label1 When you're drinking champagne you're drinking champagne
label1 When you're drinking Cristal you say you're drinking Cristal
label1 Whatever that pissityass thing is we are drinking it you know
label1 [Murmurs]  What what
label1 Hey hey hey
label1 When all of a sudden  we flip on Steve McQueen Peter Lorre being fuckin' badasses
label1 Badasses
label1 And I look over at this funnylooking motherfucker over here  and I say "I'd do that f or the Chevelle.
label1 I'm funny
label1 And that's when Chester says  "Oh really?
label1 We already told you we were drunk Ted
label1 That goes without motherfucking saying
label1 'Cause if we wasn't drunk we'd probably chicken out
label1 When you're fucked up you don't lie
label1 Man you tell the fuckin' truth
label1 Which brings us to your part in this little wager Ted
label1 I don't have a part sir
label1 That's it
label1 Like my old granddaddy used to always say  "The less a man makes declarative statements  the less apt he is to look f oolish in retrospect
label1 Ah thank you thank you thank you
label1 Thing is there are some inherent obstacles in this undertaking
label1 Aside from the obvious
label1 First of which is being the f act that I'm not like Peter Lorre on that TV show
label1 I'm not some sick fuck travelin' the countryside collecting fingers
label1 All right you know we're all buddies here
label1 No one wants Norman to lose his finger
label1 We just want to chop it off
label1 Well hopefully sir
label1 Yeah well they sewed that guy's dick back on
label1 They can sew Norman's pinky back on
label1 Yeah how hard can it be
label1 So Norman he's he's taken care of you know
label1 My interests on the other hand have not
label1 I am as emotionally attached to my car as Norman is physically to his finger
label1 That's a very fuckin' piece of expensive machinery I'm putting on this wager
label1 And you know if I lose I lose
label1 That's fine
label1 I have no problem with that
label1 I'm a big boy
label1 I knew exactly what the hell I was doing
label1 But if I win l wanna win
label1 lf Norman lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a fuckin' row  he's gonna have no emotional problems whatsoever about taking my car keys
label1 [Murmurs]  But if I win  well it's not inconceivable that at the last minute...  maybe neither Leo or l...  will be able to... wield the axe
label1 A hatchet sir
label1 Which brings us full circle to you Ted
label1 [Glass Clatters On Bar]  Cleareyed Ted
label1 Sober Ted
label1 Completestranger Ted
label1 Justmetusandcouldn't giveafuckaboutus Ted
label1 We want you to be the dice man
label1 Hell of a night huh Ted
label1 I've got to get out of here
label1 Money
label1 Ted I got a $100 bill here with your name on it  whether you do what we ask or not
label1 Just to sit back down in that chair for one minute more
label1 But that has nothin' to do with this $100 bill in my hand
label1 ln f act you can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that goddamn door
label1 But if you wait 60 seconds bef ore you do it  you're gonna be $100 richer
label1 Ted you're gonna do whatever you wanna do
label1 All we're askin' is that you indulge us for one minute more
label1 My friend Chester here is willing to pay you for that minute
label1 Ted take the money
label1 I sit on that stool listen to what you have to say for 60 seconds   and I get $100
label1 [Chester] Correct
label1 And afterwards I can walk out that door no hard f eelings
label1 You got a deal
label1 Yes
label1 Oh yes yes
label1 Yes yes yes
label1 Ted good answer
label1 All right
label1 Norman give me your watch
label1 Let me know when a minute ends and when it begins
label1 You got it
label1 Ah
label1 Okay
label1 Gentlemen start your engines
label1 Okay Ted pay attention here
label1 I'm gonna make two piles here on the bar
label1 One pile which is yours
label1 And another pile which could be yours
label1 And what you have to realize is we're gonna do this thing...  one way or the other
label1 You can buy a whole lot of soup with that pile
label1 I'm the closer here
label1 All right
label1 I'm a little me Um I've lost count
label1 How much is on the bar here
label1 Okay
label1 Ted do you know how long it takes the average American to count to 600
label1 [Angela] lt's a rhetorical question Ted
label1 No sir
label1 Now Ted a person's lif e is filled with a zillion little experiences
label1 Some which are insignificant have no meaning and you know you f orget them
label1 Others which you remember f or the rest of your natural lif e.  Now since what we're proposing here is so unusual  so outside the norm  that this is a good bet that this is going to be one of those incidents that sticks
label1 So since you're gonna be stuck remembering this f or the rest of your lif e  you have to decide what that memory will be
label1 So Ted are you going to remember for the next 40 years  give or take a decade  that you refused $1000 f or one second's worth of work
label1 Or that you made $1000 f or one second's worth of work
label1 Time
label1 Okay
label1 [Group] Yes
label1 Always be closing
label1 Right here right now
label1 Bef ore I change my mind
label1 Hear hear
label1 Let's go
label1 Get this shit over and done with
label1 Ahh
label1 Perf ect perf ect perf ect
label1 This is one of those moments in time...  none of us are ever gonna f orget
label1 I'm ready
label1 Ted are you ready
label1 Okeydokey
label1 Norman...  begin
label1 Aaah
label1 My fuckin' finger
label1 Chester my fuckin' finger man
label1 He cut off my fuckin' finger
label1 lt hurts
label1 Nonsense Syllables]  My fuckin' finger Chester
label1 He cut off my fuckin' finger
label1 Aaah
label1 Oh Leo
label1 Wrap it up
label1 Wrap it up
label1 Could I talk to Don Levine please
label1 do this
label1 he's in surgery
label1 He was expecting my call
label1 He was supposed to be there
label1 What
label1 Who the fuck has plastic surgery at 6:30 in the morning on New Year's Eve
label1 Leo
label1 I need you to stand still
label1 Hold it
label1 Oh fuck
label1 Oh fuck
label1 All right
label1 Oh
label1 Leo
label1 l gotta get the  lt's the finger
label1 I got the finger
label1 l got it
label1 I got it
label1 right here
label1 You're on it
label1 The fuckin' door's closin'
label1 Here
label1 All right let's go
label1 Let's go
label1 Let's go
label1 Let's go
label1 Come on
label1 Get up get up
label1 I'm gonna go back to my room
label1 Are you comin' or not
label1 I'll see ya
label1 [Group] Oh
label1 Close the fuckin' door
label1 Are you aware of my existence
label1 Yes
label1 This is good
label1 Now are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France
label1 Yes
label1 The Führer couldn't have said it better himself
label1 But the meaning of your visit  pleasant though it is is mysterious to me
label1 The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews  and found nothing
label1 I'm aware of that
label1 I've read the reports of this area
label1 But like any enterprise when under new management  there is always a slight duplication of efforts  most of it being a complete waste of time but needs to be done nevertheless
label1 I just have a few questions monsieur LaPadite
label1 Now  before the occupation there were four Jewish families in this area  all dairy farmers like yourself
label1 Doleracs Rollins the Loveitts  and the Dreyfuses
label1 Is that correct
label1 To my knowledge  those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers
label1 this is your house make yourself comfortable
label1 Now according to these papers  all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for  except the Dreyfuses
label1 Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished
label1 Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape  or someone is very successfully hiding them
label1 What have you heard about the Dreyfuses monsieur LaPadite
label1 I love rumors
label1 Facts could be so misleading  where rumors true or false are often revealing
label1 Again this is just a rumor  but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain
label1 So the rumors you've heard have been of escape
label1 Yes
label1 Having never met the Dreyfuses would you confirm for me  the exact members of the household and their names
label1 The father Jacob
label1 Wife Miram
label1 And her brother Bob
label1 How old is Bob
label1 Thirty 31
label1 And the children  Amos  and Shosanna
label1 Ages of the children
label1 Amos was nine or 10
label1 And Shosanna
label1 And Shosanna was  18 or 19
label1 Well I guess that should do it
label1 However before I go could I have another glass of your delicious milk
label1 But of course
label1 I have no interest in such things
label1 But you are aware of what they call me
label1 I'm aware
label1 That they call you "The Jew Hunter.
label1 Precisely
label1 Heydrich apparently hates the moniker  the good people of Prague have bestowed on him
label1 Actually why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me
label1 lt would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it
label1 Now I on the other hand love my unofficial title  precisely because I've earned it
label1 The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is  as opposed to most German soldiers  I can think like a Jew  where they can only think like a German
label1 Now if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast  it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk
label1 But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast  it would be that of the rat
label1 The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing
label1 But where our conclusions differ  is I don't consider the comparison an insult
label1 Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in
label1 It's a hostile world indeed
label1 I suppose I would
label1 Has a rat ever done anything to you  to create this animosity you feel toward them
label1 Rats spread disease
label1 They bite people
label1 I propose to you any disease a rat could spread  a squirrel could equally carry
label1 Would you agree
label1 No
label1 Yet they're both rodents are they not
label1 And except for the tail they even rather look alike don't they
label1 It's an interesting thought Herr Colonel
label1 However interesting as the thought may be  it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel
label1 Probably not
label1 I didn't think so
label1 You don't like them
label1 You don't really know why you don't like them
label1 All you know is you find them repulsive
label1 Where does the hawk look
label1 He looks in the barn he looks in the attic he looks in the cellar  he looks everywhere he would hide
label1 But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide
label1 However the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria  and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me
label1 May I smoke my pipe as well
label1 Please Herr Colonel make yourself at home
label1 Now my job dictates  that I must have my men enter your home  and conduct a thorough search  before I can officially cross your family's name off my list
label1 And if there are any irregularities to be found rest assured they will be
label1 I might add also that any information  that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment
label1 Actually quite the contrary
label1 It will be met with reward
label1 And that reward will be  your family will cease to be harassed in any way  by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country
label1 Yes
label1 Yes
label1 Point out to me the areas where they're hiding
label1 Since I haven't heard any disturbance  I assume while they're listening they don't speak English
label1 Yes
label1 ls that clear
label1 Yes
label1 It's the girl
label1 Au revoir Shosanna
label1 My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine
label1 And I'm putting together a special team and I need me eight soldiers
label1 Eight Jewish American soldiers
label1 Now you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon
label1 Well we'll be leaving a little earlier
label1 We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians
label1 Once we're in enemy territory  as a bushwhacking guerrilla army  we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only
label1 Killing Nazis
label1 Nazi ain't got no humanity
label1 They're the foot soldiers of a Jewhating massmurdering maniac  and they need to be destroyed
label1 That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform  they're going to die
label1 That means I got a little lndian in me
label1 And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance
label1 We will be cruel to the Germans
label1 And through our cruelty they will know who we are
label1 And the German won't be able to help themselves  but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands  and our boot heels and the edge of our knives
label1 And the German will be sickened by us
label1 And the German will talk about us
label1 And the German will fear us
label1 And when the German closes their eyes at night  and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done  it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with
label1 ALL: Yes sir
label1 That's what I like to hear
label1 When you join my command you take on debit
label1 A debit you owe me personally
label1 Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps
label1 And I want my scalps
label1 And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis
label1 Hey Hirschberg
label1 Send that Kraut sarge over
label1 HIRSCHBERG: You
label1 Sergeant Werner Rachtman
label1 Lieutenant Aldo Raine
label1 Pleased to meet you
label1 Yes
label1 Then sit down
label1 How is your English Werner
label1 Wicki here  an AustrianJew got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good
label1 Became American got drafted come back to give y'all what for
label1 Another one up there you might be familiar with
label1 Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz
label1 Heard of him
label1 Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz
label1 MALE NARRATOR: The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity  among German soldiers is simple
label1 Instead of putting him up against a wall  the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin  to be made an example of
label1 Needless to say once the Basterds heard about him  he never got there
label1 Lieutenant Aldo Raine
label1 These are the Basterds
label1 Ever heard of us
label1 We just want to say we're a big fan of your work
label1 When it comes to killing Nazis...   ..
label1 And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent
label1 But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur
label1 Can I assume you know who we are
label1 You're Aldo the Apache
label1 Werner if you heard of us  you probably heard we ain't in the prisonertaking business
label1 We in the killing Nazi business and cousin business is abooming
label1 Now that leaves two ways we can play this out
label1 Either kill you or let you go
label1 Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive  depends entirely on you
label1 Up the road a piece there's an orchard
label1 Besides you we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere
label1 If that patrol were to have any crack shots  that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight
label1 So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again  you got to show me on this here map where they are
label1 You got to tell me how many they are and you got to tell me  what kind of artillery they're carrying with them
label1 Well now Werner that's where you're wrong because that's exactly what I expect
label1 I need to know about Germans hiding in trees
label1 And you need to tell me
label1 Now just take that finger of yours  and point out on this here map where this party is being held  how many is coming and what they brought to play with
label1 I respectfully refuse sir
label1 Hear that
label1 Yes
label1 That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz
label1 The Bear Jew
label1 Now if you heard of Aldo the Apache you got to have heard about The Bear Jew
label1 I heard of The Bear Jew
label1 Beats German soldiers with a club
label1 He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat what he does
label1 He's going to take that big bat of his  and he's going to beat your ass to death with it
label1 Now take your Wienerschnitzellicking finger  and point out on this map what I want to know
label1 Fuck you
label1 And your Jew dogs
label1 Actually Werner we're all tickled to hear you say that
label1 Quite frankly watching Donny beat Nazis to death  is the closest we ever get to going to the movies
label1 DONNY: Yeah
label1 Oblige him
label1 Did you get that for killing Jews
label1 Bravery
label1 Yeah
label1 BASTERD 1: Oh no
label1 BASTERD 2: Oh no
label1 BASTERD: Yeah Donny
label1 About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you
label1 Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park
label1 He went yard on that one on to fucking Lansdowne Street
label1 You
label1 Damn it Hirschberg
label1 Donny bring that other one over here
label1 Alive
label1 Batter up
label1 You're on deck
label1 Two hits
label1 I hit you you hit the ground
label1 English
label1 Ask him if he wants to live
label1 Tell him to point out on this map the German position
label1 Ask him how many Germans
label1 Around about 12
label1 Now when you report what happened here  you can't tell them you told us what you told us
label1 They'll shoot you
label1 They're going to want to know why you so special we let you live
label1 Now that you've survived the war when you get home what you going to do
label1 WlCKl: He's going to hug his mother
label1 Well ain't that nice
label1 Ask if he's going to take off his uniform
label1 Yeah that's what we thought
label1 We don't like that
label1 See we like our Nazis in uniforms
label1 Just like that
label1 But you take off that uniform ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi
label1 And that don't sit well with us
label1 So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off
label1 You know how you get to Carnegie Hall don't you
label1 Practice
label1 HANS: Au revoir Shosanna
label1 Hey you can't bring those here on a public vehicle
label1 They're films ain't they
label1 Yes
label1 Then they're flammable
label1 MALE NARRATOR: Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper
label1 Shosanna has a collection  of over 350 nitrate film prints
label1 MAN: Right this way Lieutenant
label1 Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting sir
label1 General Ed Fenech
label1 At ease Hicox
label1 If you offer me a scotch and plain water I could drink a scotch and plain water
label1 Thataboy Lieutenant
label1 Make it yourself like a good chap will you
label1 The bar is in the globe
label1 Whiskey
label1 Straight
label1 No junk in it
label1 lt says here that you speak German fluently
label1 And your occupation before the war
label1 I'm a film critic
label1 List your accomplishments
label1 Well sir such as they are  I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers  and I've had two books published
label1 Don't be modest Lieutenant
label1 What are their titles
label1 The first book was called  Art of the Eyes the Heart and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema in the '20s
label1 And the second one was called TwentyFour Frame da Vinci
label1 It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W
label1 What should we drink to sir
label1 All the way down sir
label1 Yes
label1 Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich
label1 Yes
label1 Explain it to me
label1 Pardon sir
label1 Well this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry  under the Third Reich
label1 Explain to me UFA under Goebbels
label1 An alternative to what he considers  the JewishGerman intellectual cinema of the '20s  and the Jewishcontrolled dogma of Hollywood
label1 How's he doing
label1 Frightfully sorry sir
label1 Once again
label1 Well compared to say Louis B. Mayer  how's he doing
label1 Quite well actually
label1 Since Goebbels has taken over  film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years
label1 But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number
label1 I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick
label1 Lieutenant Hicox at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino
label1 Three days from now  Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris
label1 What film sir
label1 The motion picture is called Nation's Pride
label1 In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion  will be Goebbels Goring Bormann and most of the German High Command  including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo  as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry
label1 The master race at play
label1 Basically we have all our rotten eggs in one basket
label1 And like the snows of yesteryear gone from this earth
label1 Jolly good sir
label1 The Germans call them the Basterds
label1 The Basterds
label1 Never heard of them
label1 Whole point of the Secret Service old boy you not hearing of them
label1 But the Jerries have heard of them because these Yanks have been them the devil
label1 The Basterds will be waiting for you
label1 In Nadine there's a tavern called La Louisiane
label1 There you'll rendezvous with our double agent
label1 She'll take it from there
label1 She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere
label1 It'll be you her and two Germanborn members of the Basterds
label1 She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need
label1 I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you
label1 Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark
label1 Bridget von Hammersmark
label1 Yes for the last two years now
label1 One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild
label1 Indeed
label1 Got the gist
label1 I think so sir
label1 You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement
label1 l didn't know
label1 You said it was in a tavern
label1 lt is a tavern
label1 You know fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties
label1 Number one being you're fighting in a basement
label1 What if we go in there and she's not even there
label1 Don't worry
label1 She's a British spy
label1 She'll make the rendezvous
label1 Stiglitz right
label1 l hear you're pretty good with that
label1 You know we're not looking for trouble right now
label1 Simply making contact with our agent
label1 However the off chance I'm wrong things prove eventful  I need to know we can all remain calm
label1 I don't look calm to you
label1 Well now that you put it like that l guess you do
label1 This Jerry of yours Stiglitz not exactly the loquacious type is he
label1 ls that the kind of man you need
label1 Fair point Lieutenant
label1 So you all get in trouble in there what are we supposed to do
label1 Make bets on how it all comes out
label1 If we get into trouble we can handle it
label1 But if trouble does happen we need you to make damn sure  no Germans or French for that matter escape from that basement
label1 Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous
label1 She chose the spot
label1 Isn't that just dandy
label1 She's just an actress
label1 You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement
label1 She wasn't picking a place to fight
label1 Mmm
label1 HlCOX SPEAKING GERMAN ]               Well if this is it old boy  l hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's
label1 By all means Captain
label1 There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch
label1 Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily  l must say damn good stuff sir
label1 Now about this pickle  we find ourselves in
label1 lt would appear there's only one thing left for you to do
label1 Stiglitz
label1 Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls
label1 You outside
label1 Who are you
label1 British
label1 ALDO: We're American
label1 What are you
label1 I'm a German you idiot
label1 ALDO: Speak English pretty good for a German
label1 So let's talk
label1 Okay talk
label1 I'm a father
label1 My baby was born today
label1 ln Frankfurt
label1 Five hours ago
label1 H is name is Max
label1 They're the ones that came in shooting and killing
label1 It's not my fault
label1 Okay
label1 lt wasn't your fault
label1 Wilhelm
label1 Now is there anybody alive on our side
label1 No
label1 I'm alive
label1 ALDO: Who's that
label1 Which girl
label1 Who do you think
label1 Von Hammersmark
label1 Yeah she's ours
label1 Wilhelm
label1 But she's alive
label1 ALDO: Okay Wilhelm
label1 What do you say we make us a deal
label1 What's your name
label1 Okay Wilhelm here's my deal
label1 You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away
label1 No guns
label1 No guns me no guns you
label1 And we take the girl and leave
label1 It's that simple Willi
label1 You go your way we go ours
label1 So what do you say Willi
label1 Aldo
label1 I'm here Willi
label1 l want to trust you
label1 But..
label1 But how can l
label1 What choice you got son
label1 Aldo  I'm going to trust you
label1 Come down
label1 l thought we had us a deal
label1 We still have a deal
label1 Now get the girl and go
label1 Not so fast
label1 We only got a deal we trust each other
label1 You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff
label1 You got guns on us
label1 You decide to shoot we're dead
label1 They drop them down here you're dead
label1 That's a Mexican standoff and that was not the deal
label1 No trust no deal
label1 All right Aldo
label1 Fine
label1 Not so goddamn fast doc
label1 Tell him to go play with his dogs
label1 Before we yank that slug out you you need to answer a few questions
label1 Few questions about what
label1 Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened
label1 The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it
label1 l can see since you didn't see what happened inside  that the Nazis being there must look odd
label1 Yeah we got a word for that kind of odd in English
label1 It's called suspicious
label1 Everybody needs to calm down
label1 You're letting your imagination get the better of you
label1 You met the sergeant yourself
label1 Willi
label1 Yeah I remember him
label1 His wife had a baby tonight
label1 He had just become a..
label1 He had just become a father
label1 The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence
label1 It couldn't be both
label1 How'd the shooting start
label1 The Englishman gave himself away
label1 He ordered three glasses
label1 We order three glasses
label1 That's the German three
label1 Germans would and did notice it
label1 Okay let's pretend there were no Germans  and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to
label1 What was the next step
label1 To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms  with all the military there would've been suicide
label1 But going as members of the German film industry  they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else
label1 I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight
label1 How'd you intend to get them in that premiere
label1 Hand me my purse
label1 Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort
label1 You still get us in that premiere
label1 You speak German better than your friends
label1 No
label1 Have I been shot
label1 Yes
label1 Least of all by tomorrow night
label1 There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino
label1 One the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue
label1 Enormous change at the last minute
label1 That's not very Germatic
label1 Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar
label1 Which is
label1 Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere
label1 Fuck a duck
label1 What are you thinking
label1 What is that supposed to mean
label1 lt means you getting us in that premiere
label1 I'm probably going to end up losing this leg
label1 Byebye acting career
label1 Fun while it lasted
label1 How do you expect me to walk the red carpet
label1 He's going to wrap it up in a cast  and you got a good howlbrokemyleg mountainclimbing story
label1 You all like climbing mountains don't you
label1 I don't
label1 I like smoking drinking and ordering in restaurants
label1 But I see your point
label1 We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears  and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet
label1 We both speak a little ltalian
label1 With an atrocious accent no doubt
label1 But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib
label1 So you mumble ltalian and brazen through it
label1 Is that the plan
label1 That's about it
label1 That sounds good
label1 What else are we going to do
label1 Go home
label1 No that sounds good
label1 If you don't blow it with that I can get you in the building
label1 Who does what
label1 Well I speak the most ltalian so I'll be your escort
label1 Omar third most
label1 I don't speak ltalian
label1 Like I said third best
label1 Just keep your fucking mouth shut
label1 In fact why don't you start practicing right now
label1 Yes
label1 Gorlomi
label1 Gorlomi
label1 Antonio Margheriti
label1 HANS: Margheriti
label1 ANNOUNCING IN GERMAN ]     What's that American expression
label1 "If the shoe fits you must wear it.
label1 ALDO: Fucking shithead
label1 Faggot fuck
label1 Fuck you
label1 Bunch of shithead fuck
label1 Goddamn Nazi farts sons of bitches
label1 Get your hands off me
label1 You fucking bratwurstsmelling... Goddamn you
label1 Hmm
label1 You Jerrybanging Limburgsmelling...   As Stanley said to Livingstone  Lieutenant Aldo Raine I presume
label1 Hans Landa
label1 You've had a nice long run Aldo
label1 Alas you're now in the hands of the SS
label1 And they've been waiting a long time to touch you
label1 Caught you flinching
label1 ALDO: Touch me again Krautburger
label1 Utivich
label1 Is that you Lieutenant
label1 Omar
label1 The woman
label1 No I do not
label1 Tell me Aldo if I were sitting where you're sitting  would you show me mercy
label1 Nope
label1 "Looks like the shoe is on the other foot.
label1 Yeah I was just thinking that
label1 So you're Aldo the Apache
label1 So you're The Jew Hunter
label1 I'm a detective
label1 A damn good detective
label1 And yes some of them were Jews
label1 But Jew Hunter
label1 Just a name that stuck
label1 Well you do have to admit it is catchy
label1 Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you
label1 Germans' nickname for you
label1 The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man
label1 And as if to make my point I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life
label1 l mean you're a little fellow but not circusmidget little  as your reputation would suggest
label1 Where's Bridget von Hammersmark
label1 Well let's just say she got what she deserved
label1 And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark  you get what you pay for
label1 Now as far as your paesanos Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...  How you know our names
label1 Lieutenant Aldo  if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate  every single one of your swastikamarked survivors  we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed
label1 No I guess not
label1 Well back to the whereabouts of your two ltalian saboteurs
label1 As of this moment  both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in
label1 And your mission some would call a terrorist plot  as of this moment is still a go
label1 That's a pretty exciting story
label1 What's next
label1 Eliza on lce
label1 However  all I have to do is pick up this phone right here  inform the cinema and your plan is kaput
label1 I have no doubt
label1 And yes some Germans will die
label1 Yes it will ruin the evening
label1 And yes Goebbels will be very very very mad at you  for what you've done to his big night
label1 And you need all four to end the war
label1 But if I don't pick up this phone right here  you may very well get all four
label1 And if you get all four you end the war  tonight
label1 So gentlemen  let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight
label1 So the way I see it  since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction  if I do nothing  it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves
label1 I guess so
label1 How about you Utivich
label1 I guess so too
label1 Gentlemen l have no intention  of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann  not to mention winning the war singlehandedly for the Allies  only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal
label1 If you want to win the war tonight  we have to make a deal
label1 What kind of deal
label1 However I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer
label1 A general
label1 That's a bingo
label1 Is that the way you say it
label1 "That's a bingo.
label1 Bingo
label1 How fun
label1 But I digress
label1 Where were we
label1 Yeah
label1 Make a deal
label1 Over there is a very capable twoway radio and sitting behind it  is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann
label1 If that tastes better going down
label1 Where is that exactly
label1 Maynardville Tennessee
label1 I've done my share of bootlegging
label1 Long story short we hear a story too good to be true  it ain't
label1 Sitting in your chair l would probably say the same thing  and 999
label1 999 times out of a million you would be correct
label1 But in the pages of history every once in a while  fate reaches out and extends its hand
label1 MAN: I implore you
label1 We must destroy that tower
label1 Sarge that tower...  MAN: The tower stands
label1 Psst
label1 Psst
label1 HANS: So when the military history of this night is written  it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino  from the very beginning as a double agent
label1 Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel  was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil  to establish my cover with the Germans
label1 And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite  in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise
label1 I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank
label1 I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor  for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich
label1 Full citizenship for myself
label1 Well that goes without saying
label1 And I would like the United States of America  to purchase property for me on Nantucket lsland  as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved  by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party  to a swifterthanimagined end
label1 Do you have all that sir
label1 Lieutenant Raine
label1 Right here
label1 Yes sir
label1 GENERAL: Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners
label1 Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines
label1 Upon crossing our lines Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you
label1 Yes sir
label1 Over and out
label1 When I kill that guy you got 30 feet to get to that guard
label1 Can you do it
label1 Champagne
label1 Who wants to send a message to Germany
label1 I have a message for Germany
label1 That you are all going to die
label1 Marcel burn it down
label1 Oui Shosanna
label1 My name is Shosanna Dreyfus  and this is the face  of Jewish vengeance
label1 HANS: Hermann uncuff them
label1 I'm officially surrendering myself over to you Lieutenant Raine
label1 We're your prisoners
label1 How about my knife
label1 Thank you very much Colonel
label1 ls that really necessary
label1 I'm a slave to appearances
label1 Scalp Hermann
label1 What have you done
label1 I made a deal with your general for that man's life
label1 Yeah they made that deal
label1 But they don't give a fuck about him
label1 You'll be shot for this
label1 Nah I don't think so
label1 More like chewed out
label1 I've been chewed out before
label1 You know Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass
label1 I'd make that deal
label1 How about you Utivich
label1 You make that deal
label1 I'd make that deal
label1 Damn good deal
label1 Well if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command  l suppose that's worth certain considerations
label1 But I do have one question
label1 When you get to your little place on Nantucket lsland  l imagine you are going to take off that handsomelooking SS uniform of yours
label1 Ain't you
label1 That's what I thought
label1 Now that I can't abide
label1 Not one damn bit sir
label1 l mean if I had my way  you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your peckersucking life
label1 But I'm aware that ain't practical
label1 I mean at some point you're going to have to take it off
label1 So  I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off
label1 I think this just might be my masterpiece

label1 Didn't exactly set the world on fire did you Jackie?
label1 a good one is more like it
label1 Otherwise you'll be in Sybil Brand three weeks...  before the public defender gets around to ya
label1 Hey Jackie do you know a guy named Beaumont Livingston?
label1 Yeah?
label1 No?
label1 Well he knew you
label1 He's dead
label1 They found him in a trunk of a car this morning  shot twice
label1 Once in the chest once in the head
label1 Here you go
label1 So I guess I'm wondering
label1 If you don't know Beaumont  why do you suppose Beaumont knows you?
label1 You know who we want
label1 If you cooperate tell us what we want to know we'll help you get out of this
label1 If you refuse to cooperate continue to cop a shit attitude like you're doing now  we will give you to Customs and they will take you to court
label1 With your prior the judge will give you two years
label1 Now you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change  but if I was a 44yearold black woman...  desperately clinging on to this one shitty little job I was fortunate enough to get  I don't think that I'd think I had a year to throw away
label1 So let's start again now shall we
label1 I 'm not sayin' another goddamn word
label1 I 'd like your permission to look through this again so we'll know how much we're talking about
label1 Sure
label1 While we're at it let's see what else is in there
label1 Do you mind
label1 Beauty case
label1 Mmhmm
label1 What's in it
label1 Glass case
label1 Birth control

label1 How does your client plead?
label1 Uh Your Honor she wishes to stand mute
label1 Very well
label1 Detective... Varga
label1 Sorry
label1 Uh you were the arresting officer in this case?
label1 That's correct Your Honor
label1 Yes I do Your Honor
label1 And that would be?
label1 Based on the defendant's prior conviction...  and the extreme possibility of flight due to the occupation  the state requests a bond of no less than 25000
label1 I'm gonna set bond at 1 0000...  and set the date of August 2 1...  for the prelim
label1 Your Honor when will that be?
label1 That's six weeks from now
label1 We'll continue this matter then
label1 Owens case 72242
label1 How does your client plead
label1 I thought it'd be 2 5.  would like to plead guilty Your Honor
label1 here in the courtroom
label1 Uhuhuh
label1 Comfortable?
label1 Door was open so I just come on in
label1 I can see that
label1 Why?
label1 Got some more business for you
label1 What did he do?
label1 She is an airline stewardess
label1 Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow
label1 They set her bond this afternoon at $1 0000
label1 Now I'm figuring you could take that $1 0000 you owe me from Beaumont  move it over to the stewardess
label1 The bond for possession's only a thousand
label1 Hmm
label1 Man they fuckin' with her
label1 They callin' that shit "possession with intent.
label1 A 44yearold black woman caught with less than two ounces  they calling that shit "intent.
label1 The same thing happen to a movie star they call it "possession.
label1 Still sounds high
label1 You know I think somebody already did
label1 What?
label1 You ain't hear?
label1 Hear what?
label1 Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out
label1 That shit rhymes
label1 Blew Beaumont's brains out
label1 Police make contact with you?
label1 Oh hell yeah
label1 You know they see I pay a big money bond for my boy  they start thinking that "where there's smoke there's fire" logic
label1 Rousted my ass out of bed 1 0:.00 in the morning
label1 Scared the shit out of my woman Sheronda
label1 She thought they was gonna take my ass away for sure
label1 Mmhmm
label1 Brown
label1 Jackie Brown
label1 What does she do for you?
label1 She's my friend
label1 My friends get in trouble I like to help them out
label1 Beaumont worked for you
label1 You can't tell nothing I say to you?
label1 You're not my client till you get busted and I bond you out
label1 Well we ain't got no uh What you call that shit?
label1 Confidentiality
label1 Why should I tell you anything?
label1 You got stewardesses bringing you 50 grand
label1 And why would a stewardess be bringing me 50 grand?
label1 Now you want me to speculate on what you do
label1 I'd say you were in the drug business except the money's moving in the wrong direction
label1 Whatever you're into you seem to be getting away with it so uh more power to you
label1 All right
label1 You want to move the 1 0000 you got on Beaumont over to the stewardess
label1 That means paperwork
label1 I gotta get a death certificate present it to the court  make out a receipt for return of bond collateral I type up another application   Hey hey hey hey
label1 another indemnity agreement
label1 I haven't got time
label1 What you have to do in case you forgot   is come up with a premium of a thousand bucks
label1 I can do that
label1 You know I got the money
label1 Come back when you do
label1 I'll bond out the stewardess
label1 Look you got to look at this with a little compassion all right?
label1 She ain't used to this kind of treatment
label1 Gangsters don't give a fuck but your average citizen  a couple of nights in County get to fuckin' with their mind
label1 Ordell this isn't a bar
label1 You don't have a tab
label1 You got a 44yearold gainfully employed black woman falsely accused  Falsely accused?
label1 She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
label1 Falsely accused of "intent.
label1 Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?

label1 So far they told me if I cooperate  then I'll get probation maybe
label1 Or if I stand mute I can get as much as five years
label1 Does that sound right?
label1 That's state time prison
label1 But they won't want to do that
label1 They'll offer you simple possession a couple of months of county time...  and a year or two of probation
label1 Do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?
label1 Yeah
label1 But that's not what this is about
label1 They were waiting for my ass
label1 They even knew the exact amount
label1 What did they want to know?
label1 Who gave me the money and who I was givin' it to

label1 They asked
label1 And you said?
label1 "I want to talk to my lawyer.

label1 You ain't said nothin' about me
label1 Mmmm
label1 Ah that's mighty noble of you
label1 Yeah they told me
label1 Yeah
label1 Somebody must have been real mad at old Beaumont
label1 Or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time
label1 Yeah I bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions
label1 And you ain't givin' them no kind of answer
label1 You scared of me
label1 You got any reason to be nervous around me
label1 Is that what I think it is?
label1 I think it's a gun pressed up against my dick
label1 Well you thought right
label1 Now take your hands from around my throat  nigger
label1 What the hell's wrong with you Jackie?
label1 Shut the fuck up

label1 Well if it's the A.T.F
label1 I know but it's a lot of money
label1 It's a half a million dollars all in Cabo and more coming in
label1 Ordell told me last night
label1 He called?
label1 He came by
label1 We talked
label1 Do you think he still trusts you?
label1 He had his doubts at first but he's always trusted me
label1 And he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can
label1 Why
label1 Because he needs my ass
label1 You want some sugar
label1 No thank you
label1 Maybe but I'm the only one he's ever used
label1 I mean he can't use his other people
label1 They're crooks

label1 Keep it
label1 Thank you sir
label1 You told 'em it's me
label1 They already know it's you
label1 Goddamn that don't mean you got to confirm it
label1 Look the only way they're going to give me permission to fly...  is if I agree to help 'em which is what I have to appear to be doing
label1 You tell 'em anything else
label1 Yeah you got a half a mill in Mexico and you want me to bring it in
label1 Goddamn You told them all that
label1 What the fuck that got to do with anything
label1 They know I'm delivering for you
label1 I told 'em about the half mil
label1 They could give a fuck about it
label1 All they wanna do is catch your ass with guns
label1 So I said "Look you want proof he's getting paid for selling 'em
label1 And they said
label1 Yes
label1 Hey what's the matter
label1 This is just seeming kind of risky now you know
label1 Now let me lay it all out to you okay
label1 I make two deliveries the first with 10000
label1 You know like a dry run
label1 They watch it see how it works
label1 Then the second delivery I come home with the half mil
label1 See that's too much exposure
label1 Now I ain't goin' nowhere near that money
label1 You don't have to
label1 I told them you never pick up the money yourself
label1 You always send someone and I never know who it is
label1 Mm
label1 That's a good idea
label1 Now the first time I do it they're looking around  they see me hand the 10000 to someone
label1 I don't know
label1 A friend of yours
label1 Like a woman
label1 If you want
label1 Yeah
label1 Yeah I'm thinking a woman
label1 Wait a minute
label1 'Cause I don't trust 'em
label1 Now the next trip when I bring in the half mils  it's gonna look like I'm doing the same thing as I did before
label1 No
label1 I hand it to someone else first
label1 Hmm
label1 And they follow the wrong one  thinking she's bringing the money to me
label1 That's the idea
label1 Can you cover that?
label1 Yeah
label1 Yeah I got the women covered
label1 The Dell Amo Mal the food court
label1 And I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
label1 We're in this together
label1 Yeah but it's my money and I don't need no fuckin' partners
label1 I ain't your partner
label1 I'm your manager
label1 So therefore I'm your manager and a manager gets 1 5%
label1 No a manager gets ten percent
label1 No that's an agent
label1 I'm gonna give you ten
label1 No
label1 No

label1 Well he seems to be making out
label1 Is it dead?
label1 Yeah
label1 Yeah well... so far he is
label1 Oh..
label1 I wouldn't go so far as to say that
label1 He moves his lips when he reads
label1 What does that tell you?
label1 He's still a fuckup
label1 He killed a man who worked for him the other day
label1 Well  So what are you trying to tell me?
label1 That I should get out of here?
label1 That's not what I'm saying at al
label1 You know where he went?
label1 He went to go meet that stewardess
label1 Please
label1 Well I don't know

label1 Did he tell you about that half million he's got down in Mexico?
label1 Uhhuh
label1 Of course he did
label1 He tells anybody who’s gonna listen
label1 Well that's what him and that stewardess are doing
label1 They're scheming on how they can get that money over here

label1 Oh man
label1 You ain't gonna get serious while we're in here chilling
label1 It's just about Melanie
label1 You know what?
label1 I'm really sorry about that man  but I had to be somewhere all of a sudden

label1 So I thought let him kick it here with Mel
label1 She didn't have to say shit
label1 I know Melanie
label1 That bitch is gonna be fucking you two minutes after I'm out the door
label1 Melanie really good about throwing a fuck a nigger's way
label1 Oh so she ain’t your girlfriend?
label1 Is that what you thought?
label1 No I wasn't sure
label1 I didn't know
label1 But you fucked her anyway?
label1 Well...  the "not your girlfriend" part I felt more about
label1 Oh
label1 Oh oh shit
label1 you know what is she to you?
label1 You know she's just one of the bitches I got set up
label1 I got Mel over in Hermosa Beach  and I rent this little place for Simone over in Compton where you’re staying  and about four blocks away I got this young 1 9yearold country girl named Sheronda
label1 I found her on the bus stop two days out of Georgia  barefoot country as a chicken coop
label1 Took her to my place in Compton told her it was Hollywood
label1 She believed you?
label1 Hell yeah
label1 Closest she ever been anyway
label1 But you trust Melanie around your business?
label1 Oh
label1 Yeah
label1 See I knew it
label1 I knew it
label1 I knew it
label1 See you didn't have to say nothing
label1 I don't understand why you keep someone around your business and you can't even trust 'em
label1 I ain't gotta trust her
label1 I know her
label1 I don't know what that means man
label1 Well you can't trust Melanie  but you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie
label1 Well I don't understand why you keep her the fuck around

label1 He's been He's been really nice
label1 You think he's got a thing for you?
label1 Maybe
label1 No
label1 He just tries to act cool
label1 You know I don't think there's anything wrong with that
label1 He's just a young guy having fun being a cop
label1 I know the type
label1 Trust me on this
label1 He's more interested in Ordell than he is in the money
label1 If he does anything suspect it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction  but he wouldn't walk off with the money: it's evidence
label1 If I was in Nicolet's place?
label1 No I mean you right now not if you were somebody else
label1 If I saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money would I take it?
label1 You know where it came from
label1 It's not like it's somebody's life savings
label1 Half a million dollars will always be missed
label1 You're avoiding the question Max
label1 Okay sure I guess I'd be tempted  especially now since I'm getting out of the bail bond business
label1 Why?
label1 A lot of reasons
label1 I'm tired of it
label1 When did you decide?

label1 Because they're gonna be watching my ass hard
label1 That's why we can't take the risk in doing it out in the open...  or even in the dining area

label1 Now you're going to take...  the Bilingsley bag Simone gives you and give it to Sheronda
label1 Right

label1 Damn
label1 Who's wantin' to page you like that?
label1 guy
label1 Hey if I wasn't so buddybuddy with that motherfucker this wouldn't work
label1 Ordell has a guy working for him named Louis
label1 You two meet?
label1 He was at Ordell’s apartment in Hermosa Beach
label1 Yeah
label1 I don't know if he lives there but I can find out
label1 Did you talk to him?
label1 Not really
label1 Mmmm
label1 His full name's Louis Gara
label1 Just did four years up in Susanville
label1 Bank robbery
label1 We've been following him
label1 He definitely works for Ordell
label1 He's not living over in Hermosa Beach though
label1 Ordell’s got him staying down in Compton
label1 Living with some 56yearold petty thief some woman named uh...  Hawkins Simone Hawkins
label1 You know her
label1 No
label1 They ever talk about her?
label1 Not yet
label1 Okay who's the other one?
label1 What's her deal?
label1 It was her coke I got busted with
label1 She knows everything
label1 She's not a part of it  and she's pissed off that she's not a part of it
label1 Well this is definitely somebody I wanna meet
label1 Everything okay
label1 Everything's the same except for one change
label1 I told him Ordell’s changing the amount he's bringing in
label1 Think they bought it?
label1 Mm oh yeah
label1 I got 'em thinking that Ordell’s real nervous  and they love thinking that he's scared of' em
label1 You know a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit
label1 Everything's the same except for one change
label1 Ordell feels way too hot for him to bring in his money  and he knows you're watching him and he's fucking paranoid
label1 So he's sweating a little bit
label1 He's gonna keep his half mil where it is  but he's gonna bring in 50000 just in case he needs bail
label1 It'll be more than that
label1 Don't be so literal
label1 Ray believed it
label1 I'm not gonna show him the whole amount
label1 He'll see 50000
label1 And where's the rest of it?
label1 In the bag underneath
label1 What if he checks
label1 He didn't before
label1 You're taking a hell of a chance kid
label1 Not really
label1 If he finds it I'll say Mr. Walker put it in there...  and I didn't know anything about it like the coke
label1 Well then you're out
label1 You get nothing
label1 Yeah but I'm not in jail...  and at least I tried
label1 You're going to have surveillance all over you
label1 That's why you don't make a move until I come out of that fitting room
label1 Well a suit
label1 There's this one I had my eye on
label1 Hello
label1 Look here we got a little change in plans
label1 No no no no it ain't no thing
label1 Everything's the same except one little difference
label1 Well she wasn't here today 'cause she done split on my ass
label1 Yeah
label1 Me and Louis went by her pad
label1 She gone
label1 She gone her shit's gone and my 10000 motherfucking dollars is gone
label1 Don't start buggin' on me
label1 Goddamn it I'm telling you ain't nothing different
label1 Now except for this time when we make the split  instead of Simone it's gonna be Melanie
label1 I think someone's knocking on the door
label1 Goddamn it Melanie got just as much sense as that bitch has she'd be in the same place
label1 All right
label1 Yeah later
label1 Yeah
label1 Well I'm gonna open it
label1 Chicken shit
label1 Okay the envelope contains $50000
label1 Ever been tempted
label1 What?
label1 Mmhmm
label1 If I did I'd have to give one to you wouldn't I?
label1 Of course nobody knows how much there is
label1 I guess we could take as much as we want
label1 Isn't that right?
label1 All those things are true
label1 I mean it's not like the money belongs to anybody
label1 That would be one point of view
label1 Yeah
label1 Once we make this evidence it belongs to us
label1 You're officially out of trouble now
label1 Don't go doing something stupid
label1 How can I do anything stupid when I'm being watched every second?
label1 Now look
label1 Here's the deal
label1 I want you to take all this cash
label1 I want you to put it in this Bilingsley shopping bag
label1 And that is exactly what I expect to see...  when I look inside Sheronda's Bilingsley shopping bag

label1 You know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes don't you?
label1 Why should I think something's weird if I don't know nothin' about them knowin' each other?
label1 I don't wanna hear no fuckin' excuses Louis
label1 I ain't givin' you excuses
label1 But I'm tellin' you I don't fuckin' I'm givin' you fuckin' reasons
label1 Oh you gonna tell me the reason...  you lost every goddamned cent I got in the world?
label1 Hey Hey man
label1 You better  Let me tell you the reason motherfucker
label1 The reason is your ass ain't worth a shit no more
label1 What the fuck happened to you man?
label1 Her ass used to be beautiful
label1 I thought I did
label1 Yeah well you didn't
label1 You know if it’s me...  and I got all that shit hangin' over my head like you got hangin' over yours  I don't know I'd go shoppin' later
label1 Well I got there early
label1 You see I've had my eye on this suit...  that I've wanted and well I'm just gonna go try it on   Wait a minute
label1 Wait a minute
label1 Wait wait wait
label1 Just wait a fuckin' second all right?
label1 I got there early
label1 The idea was to try on the suit see if I liked it
label1 If I did they would wrap it up and I would put back on my uniform...  'cause Sheronda is expecting me to wear it
label1 Meet Sheronda give her the shopping bag with the $50000 and go home
label1 Yeah but you didn't do that
label1 Because I couldn't
label1 Melanie burst in
label1 She grabbed the bag
label1 And then somebody fuckin' killed her for it
label1 What happened to the bag she gave you?
label1 She didn't give me a bag
label1 Melanie was not a part of the plan
label1 That's why she came into the dressing room grabbed the bag took off
label1 But I couldn't go after her because I was in my fucking underwear
label1 And I had to put on this suit because I could put it on faster than my uniform   You had time to pay the sales chick
label1 Ray I was frantic
label1 What was I supposed to do?
label1 All right what you do after that?
label1 I went lookin' for you
label1 And I went back to the place in the mal...  where you were before but you weren't there
label1 You didn't tell me how to do that
label1 There was a guy with Melanie?
label1 Okay
label1 You've no idea what happened to the $50000
label1 You're clueless right?
label1 You've no idea where the 50 grand is?
label1 None
label1 You have no idea It could've gone here could've gone there?
label1 I know nothin'
label1 Not a clue
label1 Not even a little idea
label1 A maybe
label1 Not a tiny motherfuckin' idea
label1 You'd take a polygraph?
label1 Yeah if it'd motherfuckin' make you happy
label1 Yeah put it right there
label1 Man
label1 I sure hope you didn't do anything stupid Jackie
label1 Can I talk to you for a second?
label1 Louis Gara's dead
label1 L.A.P.D
label1 And we lost Ordell
label1 I thought you were fuckin' watchin' him
label1 We were and we lost him
label1 He walked into a strip bar sometime around 3:30 and never came out
label1 The bar was on Ninth what less than a mile and a half from where they found Louis
label1 It looks like Louis' buddy shot him twice pointblank range
label1 We pick up Ordell
label1 We got three murders we can link him to and we got you
label1 What about you?
label1 You think I took some of that money?
label1 Hey I have no evidence of you doin' anything
label1 You didn't pay for that snazzy new suit with marked bills
label1 I'm glad to see that
label1 You gave us Melanie
label1 You gave us Louis
label1 Melanie was found with a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts
label1 I'll settle for Ordell with marked bills
label1 But if there's anything else...  you haven't told me about you know what that's between you and Ordell
label1 I just got one thing to say
label1 You better hope we find him before he finds you
label1 I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till I get my motherfuckin' money

label1 She also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it
label1 Turn around
label1 Put your hands on your head
label1 Why don’t you tell me why?
label1 Jackie didn't trust Melanie
label1 What she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money
label1 And you helped her didn’t you?
label1 Y'all went to all that trouble just to protect my interest?
label1 In a way yes
label1 My ass may be dumb but I ain't no dumb ass

label1 Call her and give her the combination
label1 Look I'm tellin' you you got her spooked
label1 Oh you expect me to just go walkin' in there?
label1 If she wanted to set you up you'd be in custody by now
label1 When you told her that you'd name her as an accessory that scared her more than anything
label1 Mmm
label1 Then that's why she wanted to give me my money ain't it?
label1 It ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about Melanie huh?
label1 See I ain't trust Melanie either but I could handle her
label1 And I told that fuckin' Louis all he had to do was hit her in the mouth
label1 But no he had to shoot her

label1 Oh
label1 That's what happened baby
label1 Barney did this
label1 Baby now you can't come in here
label1 This is an old friend of mommy's I ain't seen in a long time
label1 Hi honey
label1 I'm  What's your name
label1 Her name is Nikki
label1 Such a pretty name for such a pretty girl
label1 How old are you Nikki
label1 Nikki asked you a question
label1 I'm 4
label1 4 years old eh
label1 You know I had a little girl once
label1 She'd be about 4 now
label1 You can go in your room now
label1 Okay
label1 Nikkia
label1 In your room
label1 Now
label1 You want some coffee
label1 Yeah
label1 This Pasadena homemaker's name  is Jeanne Bell
label1 Her husband is Dr. Lawrence Bell
label1 But back when we were acquainted four years ago  her name was Vernita Green
label1 Mine Black Mamba
label1 Do you have a towel
label1 Yeah
label1 Thanks
label1 Yeah
label1 So I suppose it's a little late for an apology
label1 You suppose correctly
label1 Look bitch I need to know  if you're gonna start more shit around my baby girl
label1 I'm not gonna murder you in front of your child okay
label1 That's being more rational  than Bill led me to believe you were capable of
label1 It's mercy compassion and forgiveness I lack
label1 Not rationality
label1 I know I fucked you over
label1 I fucked you over bad
label1 I wish to God I hadn't but I did
label1 You have every right to want to get even
label1 No
label1 To get even even Stephen  I would have to kill you go up to Nikki's room kill her  then wait for your husband to come home and kill him
label1 That'd be about square
label1 Look if I could go back in a machine I would
label1 But I can't
label1 All I can tell you is that I'm a different person now
label1 Oh great
label1 Be that as it may  I know I don't deserve your mercy or your forgiveness
label1 However I beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter
label1 Bitch you can stop right there
label1 Just because I have no wish to murder you  before the eyes of your daughter  does not mean parading her around in front of me  is gonna inspire sympathy
label1 You and I have unfinished business
label1 And not a goddamn fucking thing you've done  in the subsequent four years  including getting knocked up is gonna change that
label1 It all depends
label1 Tomorrow
label1 The day after tomorrow
label1 How about tonight bitch
label1 Splendid
label1 Where
label1 There's a baseball diamond where I coach little league  about a mile from here
label1 We meet there around 2:30 in the morning  dressed all in black your hair in a black stocking
label1 And we have us a knife fight
label1 Now I have to fix Nikki's cereal
label1 Bill said you were one of the best ladies he saw  with an edged weapon
label1 Fuck you bitch
label1 So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass Black Mamba
label1 Black Mamba
label1 I should have been motherfucking Black Mamba
label1 If you wanna stick with your butcher knife that's fine
label1 Very funny bitch
label1 Very funny
label1 It was not my intention to do this in front of you
label1 But you can take my word for it
label1 Your mother had it coming
label1 When you grow up if you still feel raw about it..
label1 I'll be waiting
label1 For those regarded as warriors..
label1 Suppress all human emotion and compassion...  ...kill whoever stands in thy way even if that be Lord God or Buddha himself
label1 Come on out to Dallas
label1 This is Rockabilly Rhythms on KTRN Wichita Falls
label1 And next we got some record
label1 Very own wild man Charlie Feathers
label1 It's a goddamn massacre Pop
label1 They wiped out the whole wedding party execution style
label1 Give me a figure
label1 Nine dead bodies
label1 And we're talking the whole shebang
label1 Bride
label1 Reverend
label1 Reverend's wife
label1 They even shot that old colored fella that plays the organ
label1 It would appear somebody objected to this  and wasn't able to hold their peace
label1 Good gravy Marie
label1 What'd I tell you Pop
label1 You're in a house of worship
label1 Sorry Pop
label1 Well this is definitely the work of professionals
label1 I'd guesstimate Mexican Mafia hit squad
label1 Four maybe five strong
label1 How can you tell
label1 Well a sure and steady hand did this
label1 This is the work of a salty dog
label1 You can tell by the cleanliness of the carnage
label1 Now a killcrazy rampage though it may be  all the colors are kept inside the lines
label1 If you was a moron you could almost admire it
label1 Who's the bride
label1 The name on the marriage certificate  is Arlene Machiavelli
label1 That's a fake
label1 You can tell she was pregnant
label1 Man would have to be a mad dog  to shoot a goddamn goodlooking gal like that in the head
label1 Haycolored hair
label1 Big eyes
label1 She's a little bloodspattered ngel
label1 Son Number One
label1 Yeah
label1 This tall drink of cocksucker ain't dead
label1 I might never have liked you
label1 But that shouldn't suggest that I don't respect you
label1 My gift to you
label1 For fuck's sake
label1 Hello Bill
label1 What's her condition
label1 Comatose
label1 Where is she

label1 You don't owe her shit
label1 Speak
label1 Y'all beat the hell out of that woman
label1 But you didn't kill her
label1 And I put a bullet in her head
label1 Now you saw that yourself  with your own beautiful blue eye did you not
label1 We've done a lot of things to this lady
label1 And if she ever wakes up we'll do a whole lot more
label1 But one thing we won't do  is sneak into her room in the night like a filthy rat  and kill her in her sleep
label1 Don't you agree Miss Driver
label1 I guess
label1 Do you really have to guess
label1 No
label1 I don't really have to guess

label1 But when one manages the difficult task  of becoming queen of the Tokio underworld  one doesn't keep it a secret does one
label1 The halfJapanese halfChinese American Army brat  made her first acquaintance with death at the age of 9
label1 It was at that age she witnessed  the death of her parents at the hands  of Japan's most ruthless yakuza boss Boss Matsumoto
label1 Mommy

label1 Luckily for her Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile
label1 At 11 she got her revenge
label1 Look at me Matsumoto...  ...take a good look at my face
label1 Look at my eyes
label1 Do I look like somebody...  you murdered?
label1 By 20 she was one of the top female assassins in the world
label1 At 25 she did her part in the killing  of nine innocent people including my unborn daughter  in a small wedding chapel in El Paso Texas
label1 But on that day four years ago she made one big mistake

label1 Yet proud as I am of my life's work..
label1 ...I have retired
label1 These are not for sale
label1 I didn't say "sell me.
label1 I said "give me.
label1 Why should I help you
label1 Because my vermin is a former student of yours
label1 And considering the student  I'd say you have a rather large obligation
label1 You can sleep here
label1 I suggest you spend it practicing
label1 I've completed doing...  ...what I swore an oath to God 28 years ago  ...to never do again
label1 I have created "something that kills people.
label1 And in that purpose I was a success
label1 If on your journey you should encounter God...  ...God will be cut
label1 Yellowhaired warrior...  Go
label1 Domo
label1 It was one year after the massacre in El Paso Texas  that Bill backed his Nippon progeny  financially and philosophically in her  Shakespearianinmagnitude power struggle  with the other yakuza clans  over who would rule vice in the city of Tokio
label1 When the final sword was sheathed  it was ORen Ishii and her powerful posse...  ...the Crazy 88 that proved the victor
label1 The pretty lady to ORen's right  who's dressed like she's a villain on "Star Trek"  is ORen's lawyer best friend and second lieutenant
label1 The halfFrench halfJapanese Sofie Fatale
label1 Another former protegee of Bill's
label1 Gogo may be young but what she lacks in age  she makes up for in madness
label1 Ferrari... ltalian trash
label1 Do you want to screw me
label1 Don't laugh
label1 Do you want to screw me yes or no
label1 Yes
label1 How 'bout now big boy
label1 Do you still wish to penetrate me...  ...or is it I...  ...or is it I... who has penetrated you
label1 The bald guy in the black suit and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo  the head general of ORen's personal army the Crazy 88
label1 And just in case you were wondering  how could a halfbreed JapaneseChinese American  become the boss of all bosses in Tokio Japan  I'll tell you
label1 The subject of ORen's blood and nationality  came up before the council only once
label1 The man who seems bound and determined  to break the mood is Boss Tanaka
label1 And what Boss Tanaka thinks is...  Boss Tanaka
label1 This is a time for celebration
label1 And what exactly are we celebrating
label1 The perversion of our illustrious council
label1 Tanaka have you gone mad
label1 I will not tolerate this
label1 Apologize
label1 TanakaSan of what perversion do you speak
label1 My father...  ...along with yours  and along with yours started this council
label1 And while...  ...you laugh like stupid donkeys...  ...they weep in the afterlife..
label1 ...over the perversion committed today
label1 Outrageous
label1 Tanaka it is you who insults this council
label1 Fuck face
label1 Gentlemen
label1 Tanaka obviously has something on his mind
label1 By all means allow him to express it
label1 I speak of the perversion done to this council  ...which I love...  ...more than my own children  ...by making a Chinese JapAmerican half breed bitch its leader
label1 So that you understand how serious I am..
label1 As your leader..
label1 I encourage you from time to time  and always in a respectful manner to question my logic
label1 If you're unconvinced  a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest  tell me so
label1 But allow me to convince you
label1 And I promise you right here and now  no subject will ever be taboo
label1 Just like this fucker here
label1 Now if any of you sons of bitches  got anything else to say now is the fucking time
label1 I didn't think so
label1 Gentlemen this meeting is adjourned
label1 One ticket to Tokio please
label1 Moshi moshi
label1 Hey
label1 Hey yeah
label1 Gogo
label1 They demand ridiculous things
label1 Shut up... Do you know what would happen if they heard you
label1 What's gonna happen
label1 Did you hear about the Tanaka clan
label1 No I don't want that
label1 Yes it's me
label1 And if you give us a contact number we will get back to you
label1 Who do you remind me of
label1 You're right he does look like Charlie Brown
label1 Charlie Brown
label1 Four pepperoni pizzas
label1 That's not on our menu..
label1 Hey... hey... Charlie give me a kiss
label1 ORen Ishii
label1 You and I have unfinished business
label1 Charlie Brown beat it
label1 Miki
label1 TEAR THE BITCH APART
label1 So ORen any more subordinates for me to kill
label1 Gogo right
label1 Bingo
label1 Our reputations precede us
label1 Don't they
label1 Gogo I know you feel you must protect your mistress
label1 Walk away
label1 You call that begging
label1 You can beg better than that
label1 You didn't think it was gonna be that easy did you
label1 You know for a second there yeah I kind of did
label1 Silly rabbit
label1 Trix are for..
label1 Kids
label1 #  # Ain't nobody doin' but me baby #  # Nobody but me #  # Well let me tell you nobody #  # Nobody but me #  # Well let me tell you nobody #  # Nobody #  This is what you get for fucking around with yakuzas
label1 Go home to your mother
label1 Those of you lucky enough to still have your lives...  ...take them with you
label1 However...  ...leave the limbs you've lost
label1 Except you Sofie
label1 You stay right where you are
label1 Your instrument is quite impressive
label1 Where was it made
label1 Okinawa
label1 Whom in Okinawa made you this steel
label1 YOU LIE
label1 Swords however never get tired
label1 I hope you've saved your energy
label1 If you haven't...  ...you might not last five minutes
label1 Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords
label1 But you can at least die like a samurai
label1 Attack me...  ...with everything you have
label1 For ridiculing you earlier..
label1 ...I apologize
label1 Accepted
label1 Ready
label1 Come on
label1 That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword
label1 Sofie
label1 My Sofie
label1 Please
label1 Please forgive my betrayal
label1 No more of that
label1 But still..
label1 Except my aching heart over what she's done  to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie
label1 I've kept you alive for two reasons
label1 The first reason is information
label1 Burn in Hell you stupid stupid blonde
label1 I'll tell you nothing
label1 But I am gonna ask you questions
label1 And every time you don't give me answers  I'm gonna cut something off
label1 And I promise you they will be things you will miss
label1 Give me your other arm
label1 I want all the information on the Deadly Vipers
label1 Why she left you alive...  And where I can find them
label1 Guessing won't be necessary
label1 She informed me
label1 She said I could keep my wicked life for two reasons
label1 As I said before  I've allowed you to keep your wicked life for two reasons
label1 And the second reason is so you can tell him in person  everything that happened here tonight
label1 I want him to witness the extent of my mercy  by witnessing your deformed body
label1 I want you to tell him all the information you just told me
label1 I want him to know I want him to know
label1 Revenge is never a straight line
label1 It's a forest
label1 And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...  ...to get lost... to forget where you came in
label1 That woman deserves her revenge
label1 And we deserve to die
label1 How did you find me
label1 I'm the man
label1 One more thing Sofie
label1 Is she aware her daughter is still alive
label1 Your Mandarin is lousy
label1 It causes my ears discomfort
label1 You bray like an ass
label1 You are not to speak unless spoken to
label1 Is it too much to hope... you understand Cantonese
label1 I speak Japanese very well..
label1 I asked if you understand Cantonese
label1 A little
label1 If you can't understand me..
label1 I will communicate with you like l would a dog
label1 When l yell when l point when l beat you with my stick
label1 Bill is your master is he not
label1 Yes he is
label1 Your master tells me... you're not entirely unschooled
label1 I am proficient in TigerCrane Style  And l am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the Samurai sword
label1 The exquisite art of the Samurai sword
label1 Don't make me laugh
label1 Your anger amuses me
label1 Do you believe you are my match
label1 No
label1 Are you aware l kill at will
label1 Is it your wish to die
label1 No
label1 Then you must be stupid...  Then you must be stupid... so stupid
label1 Rise and let me look at your ridiculous face
label1 Rise
label1 What's the matter
label1 Cat got your tongue
label1 Oh yes you speak Japanese
label1 Go to that rack
label1 Remove the sword
label1 Let's see how good you really are
label1 From here you can get an excellent view of my foot
label1 Your swordsmanship... is amateur at best
label1 Your socalled kungfu... is really... quite pathetic
label1 I asked you to demonstrate... what you know... and you did...  Not a goddamn thing
label1 Like all Yankee women...  ... all you can do is order in restaurants and spend a man's money
label1 Excruciating... isn't it
label1 If it was my wish...  ... l could chop your arm off
label1 No please don't
label1 It's my arm now
label1 l can do what l please
label1 I can't
label1 Because you're helpless
label1 Yes
label1 Have you ever felt this before
label1 Compared to me... you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle
label1 YES!!
label1 THAT'S THE BEGlNNlNG
label1 Ls it your wish to possess this kind of power
label1 Yes
label1 Your training will begin... tomorrow
label1 Since your arm now belongs to me...  ... l want it strong
label1 Can you do that
label1 Then you can't do it
label1 What if your enemy... is three inches in front of you...  ... What do you do then...  ... Curl into a ball...  ... or do you put your FlST through him
label1 Now begin
label1 No wonder you can't do it... you acquiesce to defeat...   before you even begin
label1 If you want to eat like a dog...  You can live and sleep outside like a dog
label1 If you want to live and sleep like a human...  ... pick up those sticks
label1 Come on you bitch
label1 Here l come
label1 Elle you treacherous dog
label1 It's too risky
label1 I'm through doing that shit
label1 You always say that
label1 The same thing every time
label1 "I'm through never again too dangerous.
label1 I know that's what I always say
label1 You forget about it in a day or two
label1 The days of me forgetting are over
label1 The days of me remembering have just begun
label1 You know when you go on like this what you sound like
label1 You sound like a duck
label1 Quack quack quack
label1 Take heart 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again
label1 After tonight
label1 Correct
label1 Can I get anyone more coffee
label1 Oh yes
label1 Thank you
label1 You're welcome
label1 I mean the way it is now you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank
label1 Banks are easier
label1 Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery
label1 They're insured
label1 I don't even need a gun in a federal bank
label1 Heard about this one bloke he walks into a bank with a portable phone
label1 He gives the phone to a teller
label1 The bloke on the other end says...  "We got this guy's little girl
label1 If you don't give him all your money we're gonna kill her.
label1 Fuckin' right it worked
label1 That's what I'm talkin' about
label1 Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone...  not a pistol not a shotgun a fuckin' phone
label1 Cleans the place out
label1 They don't lift a fuckin' finger
label1 Did they hurt the little girl
label1 There probably never was a little girl
label1 You want to rob banks
label1 I'm not saying I wanna rob banks
label1 I'm illustrating if we did it'd be easier than what we've been doing
label1 No more liquor stores
label1 Yeah no more liquor stores
label1 Besides it ain't the giggle it used to be
label1 There's too many foreigners own liquor stores
label1 Vietnamese Koreans don't even speak fuckin' English
label1 You tell 'em empty out the register they don't know what you're talkin' about
label1 We keep on one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him
label1 I'm not gonna kill anybody
label1 I don't want to kill anybody either
label1 But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them
label1 And if it's not the gooks...  it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations
label1 You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand
label1 Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone
label1 Forget it
label1 We're out of it
label1 Well what then day jobs
label1 Not in this life
label1 <i>Garcon coffee!</i>  This place
label1 This place
label1 A coffee shop
label1 What's wrong with that
label1 Nobody ever robs restaurants
label1 Why not
label1 Bars liquor stores...  gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them
label1 Restaurants on the other hand you catch with their pants down
label1 Not as expectin' anyway
label1 I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this
label1 Correct
label1 Manager
label1 He don't give a fuck
label1 Waitresses
label1 Fuckin' forget it
label1 No way they're takin' a bullet for the register
label1 Busboys
label1 Some wetback gettin' paid $1 .50 an hour...  really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner
label1 Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths they don't know what's goin' on
label1 See I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up remember
label1 All the customers kept comin' in
label1 Yeah
label1 Now that was a good idea
label1 Thank you
label1 Made more from the wallets than we did from the register
label1 Yes we did
label1 A lot of people come to restaurants
label1 Pretty smart huh
label1 Pretty smart
label1 I'm ready
label1 Right now right here
label1 Come on
label1 All right
label1 Same as last time remember
label1 I'll handle the employees
label1 I love you pumpkin
label1 I love you honey bunny
label1 Everybody be cool
label1 This is a robbery
label1 Any of you fucking pricks move...  and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you
label1 Okay what you want to know
label1 Yeah it's legal but it ain't 100% legal
label1 You just can't walk into a restaurant roll a joint and start puffin' away
label1 I mean they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places
label1 Those are hash bars
label1 Yeah
label1 It breaks down like this
label1 It's legal to own it
label1 And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar it's legal to sell it
label1 It's illegal to carry it but that doesn't matter 'cause get a load of this
label1 I mean that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have
label1 Oh man
label1 I'm goin'
label1 That's all there is to it
label1 I'm fuckin' goin'
label1 I know baby
label1 But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is
label1 It's the little differences
label1 I mean they got the same shit over there that they got here...   but it's just there it's a little different
label1 Example
label1 You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer
label1 I'm talkin' about a glass of beer
label1 And in Paris you can buy a beer in McDonald's
label1 You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris
label1 They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese
label1 They wouldn't know what the fuck a quarterpounder is
label1 What do they call it
label1 They call it a Royale with Cheese
label1 Royale with Cheese
label1 What do they call a Big Mac
label1 Big Mac's a Big Mac but they call it Le Big Mac
label1 Le Big Mac
label1 What do they call a Whopper
label1 I don't know
label1 I didn't go into Burger King
label1 What
label1 Mayonnaise
label1 Goddamn
label1 They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit
label1 Yuck
label1 We should have shotguns for this kind of deal
label1 How many up there
label1 Three or four
label1 That's countin' our guy
label1 It's possible
label1 We should have fuckin' shotguns
label1 What's her name
label1 Mia
label1 Mia
label1 I don't know
label1 However people meet people
label1 She used to be a actress
label1 Oh really
label1 She do anything I'd have seen
label1 I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot
label1 What's a pilot
label1 I don't watch TV
label1 Yeah but you are aware that there is an invention called television...  and on this invention they show shows right
label1 Yeah
label1 The way they pick TV shows is they make one show
label1 That show's called a pilot
label1 Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows...  and on the strength of that one show they decide if they wanna make more shows
label1 Some get chosen and become television programs
label1 She starred in one of the ones that became nothing
label1 You remember Antwan Rockamora
label1 Halfblack halfSamoan
label1 Yeah maybe
label1 Fat right
label1 I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat
label1 He got a weight problem
label1 I mean what's a nigger gonna do
label1 I think I know who you mean
label1 Marsellus fucked him up good
label1 Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife
label1 So what he'd do
label1 Fuck her
label1 No no no no no
label1 Nothin' that bad
label1 Well then what then
label1 He gave her a foot massage
label1 Then what'd Marsellus do
label1 Sent a couple cats over to his place
label1 They took him out on his patio
label1 Threw his ass over the balcony
label1 Nigger fell four stories
label1 He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass like a greenhouse
label1 Since then he kind of developed a speech impediment
label1 That's a damn shame
label1 What do you mean
label1 You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage
label1 You don't think he overreacted
label1 Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did but he had to expect a reaction
label1 It was a foot massage
label1 A foot massage is nothin'
label1 I give my mother a foot massage
label1 I mean is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out
label1 No but it's the same fuckin' ballpark
label1 Stop right there
label1 Eatin' the bitch out and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing
label1 It's the same ballpark
label1 Now look maybe your method of massage differs from mine
label1 But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...  ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport
label1 Foot massages don't mean shit
label1 Have you ever given a foot massage
label1 Don't be tellin' me about foot massages
label1 I'm the foot fuckin' master
label1 You given a lot of them
label1 Shit yeah
label1 Would you give a guy a foot massage
label1 Fuck you
label1 You give 'em a lot
label1 Fuck you
label1 You know I'm kind of tired
label1 I could use a foot massage
label1 Yo yo yo man
label1 You best back off
label1 This is the door
label1 What time you got
label1 7:22 in the a.m.  No it ain't quite time yet
label1 Come on
label1 Let's hang back
label1 Now look just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right...  for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin' house...  fuckin' up the way the nigger talks; that shit ain't right
label1 Motherfucker do that shit to me he better paralyze my ass 'cause I kill the motherfucker
label1 I'm sayin' it does
label1 Now look I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'
label1 That's what's so fuckin' cool about them
label1 There's a sensuous thing goin' on...  where you don't talk about it but you know it and she knows it
label1 Fuckin' Marsellus knew it
label1 That's his fuckin' wife man
label1 This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit
label1 You know what I'm sayin'
label1 It's an interestin' point
label1 Come on
label1 Let's get into character
label1 What's her name again
label1 Mia
label1 Why you so interested in big man's wife
label1 He's goin' out of town Florida
label1 And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone
label1 Take care of her
label1 Show her a good time
label1 Make sure she don't get lonely
label1 You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date
label1 It is not a date
label1 It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'
label1 It's just good company that's all
label1 It's not a date
label1 Hey kids
label1 How you boys doin'
label1 Hey keep chillin'
label1 We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace

label1 I never  Oh I'm sorry did I break your concentration
label1 I didn't mean to do that

label1 No no
label1 You read the Bible Brett
label1 Yes
label1 Well there's this passage I got memorized
label1 Sort of fits this occasion
label1 "The path of the righteous man..."  is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish...  and the tyranny of evil men
label1 Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill...  shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness...  for he is truly his brother's keeper...  and the finder of lost children
label1 And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
label1 And you will know my name is the Lord...  "when I lay my vengeance upon thee!
label1 I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker
label1 The thing is Butch...  right now... you got ability
label1 But painful as it may be ability... don't last
label1 And your days are just about over
label1 But that's a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about
label1 You see this business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers
label1 Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine
label1 If you mean it turns to Vinegar... it does
label1 If you mean it gets better with age... it don't
label1 Two
label1 Boxers don't have an oldtimers' day
label1 You came close but you never made it
label1 And if you were gonna make it you would have made it before now
label1 You my nigger
label1 Certainly appears so
label1 That's pride fuckin' with you
label1 Fuck pride
label1 Pride only hurts

label1 All my piercing 18 places on my body every one of 'em done with a needle
label1 Five in each ear one through the nipple of my left breast...  two in my right nostril one in my left eyebrow...  one in my belly one in my lip one in my clit...   and I wear a stud in my tongue

label1 Sure did
label1 Just over three years
label1 I go there about once a year to chill out for a month
label1 No kiddin'
label1 I didn't know that
label1 Why would you
label1 I heard you did a pilot
label1 That was my 15 minutes
label1 It was a show about a team of female secret agents called Fox Force Five
label1 <i> Fox Force Five.</i>  Fox as in were a bunch of foxy chicks
label1 Force as in we're a force to be reckoned with
label1 And five as in there's onetwothreefourfive of us
label1 There was a blond one Sommerset O'Neal
label1 The Japanese fox was a Kung Fu master
label1 The black girl was a demolition expert
label1 French Fox's specialty was sex
label1 What was your specialty
label1 The character I played Raven McCoy...  her background was she grew up raised by circus performers
label1 According to the show she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife
label1 And she knew a zillion old jokes
label1 Her grandfather an old vaudevillian taught her
label1 And if we would have got picked up they would've worked in a gimmick...  where every show I would've told another joke
label1 You know any of them old jokes
label1 Well I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show
label1 It's corny
label1 Don't be that way
label1 No you wouldn't like it and I'd be embarrassed
label1 You'd be embarrYou told 50 million people and you can't tell me
label1 I promise I won't laugh
label1 That's not what I meant
label1 You know it
label1 Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much
label1 What a gyp
label1 Vanilla coke
label1 Yummy
label1 You think I could have a sip of that
label1 Be my guest
label1 I gotta know what a fivedollar shake tastes like
label1 You can use my straw
label1 Yeah but maybe I do
label1 Cooties I can handle
label1 All right
label1 Told ya
label1 I don't know if it was worth five dollars but it's pretty fuckin' good
label1 Don't you hate that
label1 Hate what
label1 Uncomfortable silences
label1 Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable
label1 That's a good question
label1 That's when you know you found somebody really special
label1 When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence
label1 We just met each other
label1 I'll tell you what
label1 You sit here... and think of something to say
label1 I'll do that
label1 Okay
label1 I said goddamn
label1 Goddamn
label1 I need some hair spray
label1 Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom...  to find your food waiting for you
label1 We're lucky we got anything at all
label1 I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter
label1 Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section
label1 Which one
label1 That is Marilyn Monroe
label1 That is Mamie Van Doren
label1 I don't see Jayne Mansfield so she must have the night off
label1 Pretty smart
label1 Yeah
label1 I got my moments
label1 So did you think of somethin' to say
label1 Actually I did
label1 I don't want to offend you
label1 This doesn't sound like the usual mindless boring gettin'toknowyou chitchat
label1 This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say
label1 Well well I do
label1 But you have to promise not to be offended
label1 No no
label1 I have no idea what you're gonna ask me
label1 You can ask me what you're gonna ask me...  and my natural response could be to get offended
label1 Then through no fault of my own I would have broken my promise
label1 Let's just forget it
label1 That's an impossibility
label1 Is that a fact
label1 And besides...  isn't it more exciting when you don't have permission
label1 All right all right
label1 Well here goes
label1 Who's Antwan
label1 Tony Rocky Horror
label1 He fell out of a window
label1 Well that is one way to say it
label1 Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out
label1 Yet even another way...  is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you
label1 Is that a fact
label1 No
label1 No it's not a fact
label1 It's just what I heard
label1 That's just what I heard
label1 Who told you
label1 "They" talk a lot don't they
label1 They certainly do
label1 They certainly do
label1 Don't be shy Vincent
label1 What else did ""they" say
label1 No no no no no
label1 They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage
label1 And
label1 And nothin'
label1 That's it
label1 You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourthstory window...  for giving me a foot massage
label1 And you believe that
label1 Well at the time I was told it sounded reasonable
label1 No it seemed excessive but that doesn't mean it didn't happen
label1 I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you
label1 A husband being protective of his wife is one thing
label1 A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else
label1 Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it... at my wedding
label1 Really
label1 When you little scamps get together you're worse than a sewing circle
label1 Ladies and gentlemen
label1 Now the moment you've all been waiting for
label1 The worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest
label1 Now this is where one lucky couple...  will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding
label1 Right here
label1 All right
label1 No no no no no
label1 No no no no no
label1 I do believe Marsellus my husband your boss...  told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted
label1 Now I wanna dance; I wanna win; I want that trophy
label1 All right
label1 You asked for it
label1 Let's hear it for our first contestants
label1 Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening

label1 <i>One more thing and we'll start for</i>   Butch stop watching TV for a second
label1 Yeah
label1 You've got a special Visitor
label1 Stand up.</i>  Now do you remember when I told you your daddy died in a POW camp
label1 Well this here is Captain Koons
label1 Hello little man
label1 Boy I sure heard a bunch about you
label1 See I was a good friend of your dad's
label1 Hopefully...  you'll never have to experience this yourself...  but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were...  for as long as we were...  you take on certain responsibilities of the other
label1 If it'd been me who'd...  not made it Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim
label1 But the way it turned out I'm talking to you
label1 Butch..
label1 I got something for ya
label1 This watch I got here...  was first purchased by your greatgrandfather during the First World War
label1 It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville Tennessee
label1 Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches
label1 It was bought by private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...  on the day he set sail for Paris
label1 This was your greatgrandfather's war watch...  and he wore it every day he was in that war and...  when he'd done his duty he went home to your greatgrandmother...  took the watch off put it in an old coffee can and in that can it stayed...  until your granddad Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country...  to go overseas and fight the Germans once again
label1 This time they called it World War II
label1 Unfortunately Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's
label1 Dane was a Marine and he was killed...  along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island
label1 Your granddad was facing death
label1 He knew it
label1 None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive...  so three days before the Japanese took the island...  your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport name of Winocki...  a man he'd never met before in his life...  to deliver to his infant son...  who he'd never seen in the flesh his gold watch
label1 After the war was over he paid a visit to your grandmother...  delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch
label1 This watch
label1 This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi
label1 He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch...  it'd be confiscated taken away
label1 The way your dad looked at it this watch was your birthright
label1 Five long years he wore this watch up his ass
label1 Then he died of dysentery He give me the watch
label1 I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years
label1 Then...  after seven years I was sent home to my family and...  now...  little man I give the watch to you
label1 It's time Butch
label1 <i>In the lightweight division...</i>  <i>in the right corner</i> <i>wearing the blue trunks...</i>  <i>weighing 210 pounds...</i>  <i>Floyd Ray Wilson!</i>  <i>It's official
label1 Marsellus
label1 No it wasn't
label1 I didn't do it
label1 I didn't do it
label1 Great
label1 I never thanked you for dinner
label1 What you got
label1 He booked
label1 His trainer
label1 I believe him
label1 No we don't wanna think
label1 We wanna know
label1 Take him to the kennel sic the dogs on his ass
label1 We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't
label1 Butch's searchhow do you want it done
label1 I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker
label1 If Butch goes to Indochina I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...   ready to pop a cap in his ass
label1 Mister
label1 What
label1 You were in that fight the fight on the radio
label1 You're the fighter
label1 Whatever gave you that idea
label1 No come on
label1 You're him
label1 I know you're him
label1 I'm him
label1 You killed the other boxing man
label1 He's dead
label1 The radio said he was dead
label1 What does it feel like
label1 What does what feel like
label1 Killing a man
label1 Beating another man to death with your bare hands
label1 No
label1 It is a subject I have much interest in
label1 You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody
label1 So
label1 I'll tell you what
label1 Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there and I'll tell you all about it
label1 So Esmarelda...  Villa Lobosis that Mexican
label1 That's some handle you got there honey
label1 Thank you
label1 And what is your name
label1 Butch
label1 What does it mean
label1 Our names don't mean shit
label1 So moving right along Esmarelda...  what is it you want to know
label1 I couldn't tell ya
label1 I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead
label1 Now that I know he's dead you wanna know how I feel about it
label1 What the fuck'd I tell ya
label1 As soon as the word got out the fix was in man the odds went through the roof
label1 I know
label1 I know
label1 Unbelievable
label1 If he was a better boxer he'd still be alive
label1 If he never laced up his gloves...  which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place he'd still be alive
label1 Yeah well who gives a fuck
label1 Yeah well enough about the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd
label1 Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch
label1 How many bookies did you lay it around on
label1 All eight
label1 So you'll have it all by tomorrow night
label1 No I understand
label1 A few stragglers aside
label1 Oh fuck Scotty that is good news
label1 That is great news man
label1 Yeah
label1 No me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning
label1 Okay my brother
label1 You're right
label1 All right Scotty next time I see you it'll be on Tennessee time
label1 Cool brother
label1 $45.60
label1 Now... if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight what are you gonna say
label1 The truth
label1 Three welldressed slightly toasted Mexicans
label1 Bonsoir Esmarelda Villa Lobos
label1 <i>Buenas noches Butch.</i>  Whew
label1 Keep the light off
label1 <i> Oui.</i>  Hard day at the office
label1 Got in a fight
label1 Poor baby
label1 Can you make spoons
label1 You know what
label1 I'm stinkin' like a dog over here
label1 I like the way you stink
label1 Let me take this jacket off
label1 I was looking at myself in the mirror
label1 Uhhuh
label1 I wish I had a pot
label1 A pot
label1 A pot belly
label1 Pot bellies are sexy
label1 Well you should be happy...  'cause you have one
label1 I don't have a pot
label1 I have a bit of a tummy like Madonna when she did "'Lucky Star.
label1 It's not the same thing
label1 I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy
label1 The difference is huge
label1 Would you like it if I had a pot belly
label1 Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla
label1 The rest of you is normalnormal face normal legs normal hips normal ass...  but with a big perfectly round pot belly
label1 If I had one I'd wear a Tshirt two sizes too small to accentuate it
label1 You think men would find that attractive
label1 I don't give a damn what men find attractive
label1 It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye...  is seldom the same
label1 You'd punch me in the belly
label1 Right in the belly
label1 Ohh
label1 I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe
label1 You'd do that
label1 Yeah
label1 Promise
label1 Yeah
label1 Did you get everything
label1 Yes I did
label1 Did everything go as planned
label1 You didn't listen to the radio

label1 Well there's this passage I got memorized
label1 Sorta fits the occasion
label1 "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides..."  by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
label1 Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will...  shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness...  for he is truly his brother's keeper...  and the finder of lost children
label1 And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
label1 And you will know my name is the Lord...  "when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

label1 No no no no
label1 That shit wasn't luck
label1 Yeah maybe
label1 This was divine intervention
label1 You know what divine intervention is
label1 I think so
label1 That's right
label1 That's exactly what it means
label1 God came down from heaven and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets
label1 I think it's time for us to leave Jules
label1 Don't fuckin' blow this shit off
label1 What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle
label1 Chill
label1 This shit happens
label1 Wrong
label1 This shit doesn't just happen
label1 We should be fuckin' dead my friend
label1 What happened here was a miracle and I want you to fucking acknowledge it
label1 All right it was a miracle
label1 Can we go now

label1 You gotta have an opinion
label1 You think God came down from heaven and stopped

label1 I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch
label1 The gun went off
label1 We're on a city street in broad daylight here
label1 I don't believe it
label1 Well believe it now motherfucker
label1 We gotta get this car off the road
label1 Cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood
label1 This is the Valley Vincent
label1 Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley
label1 Well Jules this ain't my fuckin' town man
label1 Shit
label1 I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake
label1 Where's Toluca Lake
label1 Over the hill here by Burbank Studios
label1 If Jimmie's ass ain't home I don't know what the fuck we gonna do...  'cause I ain't got no other partners in 818
label1 Jimmie how you doin' man
label1 It's Jules
label1 I need to use your garage for a couple hours
label1 We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation
label1 He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door
label1 If he does what do we do
label1 We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls...  but I don't want it to reach that pitch Jimmie's a friend
label1 You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what
label1 Just tell him not to be abusive
label1 Put yourself in his position It's 8:00 in the morning he just woke up
label1 We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor
label1 If that favor means I gotta take shit he can stick that favor straight up his ass
label1 Fuck nigger what the fuck'd you just do to his towel man
label1 I was dryin' my hands
label1 You're supposed to wash 'em first
label1 You watched me wash 'em
label1 I watched you get 'em wet
label1 This shit's hard to get off
label1 I used the same fuckin' soap you did...  and when I finished the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxipad
label1 What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this
label1 It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head man
label1 Look I ain't threatenin' you or nothin' all right
label1 You know I respect you and all
label1 But just don't put me in this position all right
label1 All right
label1 Fine
label1 Ask me nice like that no problem
label1 Go ahead
label1 I don't care
label1 Goddamn Jimmie
label1 This some serious gourmet shit
label1 Me and Vincent would've been satisfied with some freezedried Taster's Choice
label1 Right
label1 What flavor is this
label1 Knock it off Julie
label1 I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is
label1 I'm the one who buys it
label1 I know how good it is
label1 When Bonnie goes shopping she buys shit
label1 I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it I wanna taste it
label1 But you know what's on my mind right now
label1 It's the dead nigger in my garage
label1 Jimmie don't even worry  Don't tell me about anything
label1 When you came pulling in here...  did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said "'Dead nigger storage"
label1 You know I ain't seen no
label1 Did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said "Dead nigger storage"
label1 I didn't
label1 You know why you didn't see that sign
label1 Why
label1 'Cause it ain't there 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business that's why
label1 We're not gonna store the motherfucker  Don't you fuckin' realize...  that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house I'm gonna get divorced
label1 No trial separation
label1 I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced
label1 Okay
label1 And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced
label1 Jimmie Jimmie she ain't gonna leave you
label1 Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me Jules
label1 Okay
label1 Don't fuckin' '"Jimmie" me
label1 There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife
label1 Is there
label1 The graveyard shift at the hospital
label1 You gotta make some phone calls
label1 You gotta call some people
label1 That's Kool and the Gang
label1 We don't wanna fuck your shit up
label1 All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in
label1 You're fucking my shit up right now
label1 You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home
label1 The phone is in my bedroom
label1 Well say she comes home
label1 What do you think she'll do
label1 Oh no fuckin' shit she'll freak
label1 That ain't no kinda answer
label1 I mean you know I don't
label1 How much
label1 A lot or a little
label1 <i>She comes home from a hard day's work finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...</i>  <i>doing a bunch of gangster shit...</i>  <i>there ain't no tellin'</i> <i>what she's liable to do.</i>  Yeah I grasp that Jules
label1 All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs
label1 I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs
label1 All I want to hear from your ass is...  "You ain't got no problem Jules I'm on the motherfucker
label1 Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry which should be coming directly.
label1 I'm on the motherfucker
label1 Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf who should be coming directly
label1 You sendin' the Wolf
label1 Oh you feel better motherfucker
label1 That's all you had to say
label1 When is she due
label1 Give me the principals' names again
label1 Place your bets
label1 Cards please
label1 Vincent
label1 Jimmie
label1 Bonnie

label1 I'm Winston Wolf
label1 I solve problems
label1 Good
label1 So I heard
label1 May I come in
label1 Yeah
label1 Please do
label1 You must be Jules
label1 Let's get down to brass tacks gentlemen
label1 If I was informed correctly the clock is ticking
label1 Is that right Jimmie
label1 Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m. correct
label1 I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here she wouldn't appreciate it much
label1 She wouldn't at that
label1 That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge...  which if you do what I say when I say it should be plenty
label1 Now you got a corpse in a car minus a head in a garage
label1 Jimmie
label1 Uhhuh
label1 Do me a favor will ya
label1 Thought I smelled some coffee back there
label1 Would you make me a cup
label1 Yeah sure
label1 Oh how do you take it
label1 About the car is there anything I need to know
label1 Does it stall
label1 Does it smoke
label1 Is there gas in it
label1 Aside from how it looks the car's cool
label1 Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work
label1 As far as I know the motherfucker's tiptop
label1 Good enough
label1 Let's go back to the kitchen
label1 Here you go Mr. Wolf
label1 Thank you Jimmie
label1 Okay first thing
label1 Take the body stick it in the trunk
label1 Now Jimmie this looks to be a pretty domesticated house
label1 Yeah
label1 Under the sink
label1 Good
label1 What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products...  and clean the inside of the carI'm talkin' fast fast fast
label1 Get it out of there
label1 Wipe down the upholstery
label1 It don't need to be spickandspan
label1 You don't need to eat off it
label1 Just give it a good onceover
label1 The pools of blood that have collected you gotta soak that shit up
label1 We need to raid your linen closet
label1 I need blankets I need comforters quilts bedspreads
label1 The thicker the better the darker the better
label1 No whites
label1 We'll need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards...  with quilts and blankets...  so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car the subterfuge won't last...  but at a glance the car will appear to be normal
label1 Jimmie lead the way
label1 Boys get to work
label1 Come again
label1 I said a please would be nice
label1 Get it straight Buster
label1 I'm here to tell you what to do
label1 And if selfpreservation is an instinct you possess...  you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick
label1 I'm here to help
label1 If my help's not appreciated lotsa luck gentlemen
label1 Mr. Wolf listen
label1 I don't mean disrespect okay
label1 I respect you
label1 If I'm curt with you it's because time is a factor
label1 I think fast I talk fast and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this
label1 So pretty please with sugar on top clean the fuckin' car
label1 Don't be lookin' at me like that all right
label1 I can feel your look
label1 Green
label1 Nothin' except for the mess inside
label1 About 20 minutes
label1 You're a good man Joe
label1 Thanks a bunch
label1 How we comin' Jimmie

label1 I wanna help
label1 Let me ask you a question
label1 If you don't mind
label1 No no please
label1 Go ahead
label1 No
label1 Well your Uncle Marsellus is
label1 And I'm positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...   Ginny
label1 Ginny were here...  they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set...  which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do
label1 That's what I have in my bedroom
label1 How about you Jimmie
label1 You an oak man
label1 Oak's nice
label1 Oh man I will never forgive your ass for this shit
label1 Jules did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits that he is wrong...  that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings
label1 The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up ittybitty pieces of skull...  on account of your dumb ass
label1 I got a threshold Jules for the abuse that I will take
label1 Right now I'm a fuckin' race car and you got me in the red
label1 I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red
label1 That's all
label1 I could blow
label1 Oh you ready to blow
label1 Yeah
label1 I'm the Guns of the Navarone
label1 In fact what the fuck am I doin' in the back

label1 Fine job gentlemen
label1 I can't believe this is the same car
label1 Well let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet
label1 Phase one is completeclean the car which moves us right along to phase two:  clean you two
label1 Strip
label1 To your bare ass
label1 Quickly gentlemen
label1 We got about 15 minutes...  before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway
label1 Are you sure this is absolutely necessary
label1 You know what you two look like
label1 What
label1 Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head
label1 Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary
label1 Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag
label1 Don't worry we're taking it with us
label1 Jim the soap
label1 Vincent
label1 You both been to county before I'm sure
label1 Here it comes
label1 Goddamn

label1 We're laughing our way right into prison
label1 Don't make me beg
label1 We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow
label1 Now Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma
label1 The place is North Hollywood...  so a few twists and turns aside we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way
label1 Now I'll drive the tainted car
label1 Jules you ride with me
label1 Now if we come across the path of any John Q
label1 Right
label1 What did I say
label1 Don't do shit unless
label1 Unless what
label1 Unless you do it first
label1 How about you Lash LaRue
label1 Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling
label1 The gun went off
label1 I don't know why
label1 I'm cool I promise you
label1 Fair enough
label1 If I get my car back any different than I gave it...  Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies
label1 Outta my way Rex
label1 We cool
label1 All right
label1 Someday all this will be hers
label1 Hi

label1 I'd go for some breakfast
label1 Feel like havin' breakfast with me

label1 Yeah he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob
label1 I know that now
label1 But was he cool or what
label1 Totally fuckin' cool in control
label1 Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed
label1 Want some bacon
label1 No man I don't eat pork
label1 I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine that's all
label1 Why not
label1 Pigs are filthy animals
label1 I don't eat filthy animals
label1 Pork chops taste good
label1 Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie but I'd never know...  'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers
label1 Pigs sleep and root in shit
label1 That's a filthy animal
label1 How about a dog
label1 I don't eat dog either
label1 Yeah but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal
label1 I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy...  but they're definitely dirty
label1 But a dog's got personality
label1 Personality goes a long way
label1 So by that rationale...  if a pig had a better personality he would cease to be a filthy animal is that true
label1 We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig
label1 Oh man that's good
label1 That's good man
label1 You've been sittin' there all serious and shit
label1 I just been sittin' here thinkin'
label1 About what
label1 About the miracle we witnessed
label1 I witnessed a freak occurrence
label1 What is a miracle Vincent
label1 And what's an act of God
label1 When God makes the impossible possible
label1 But this morning..
label1 I don't think qualifies
label1 Hey Vincent
label1 You're judging this shit the wrong way
label1 It could be God stopped the bullets changed Coke to Pepsi found my car keys
label1 You don't judge shit like this based on merit
label1 Now whether or not what we experienced...  was an AccordingtoHoyle miracle is insignificant
label1 God got involved
label1 But why
label1 Well that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why
label1 But I can't go back to sleep
label1 You're serious
label1 For life
label1 Most definitely
label1 Yeah
label1 Fuck
label1 What you gonna do then
label1 Well that's what I been sitting here contemplating
label1 Then basically I'm just gonna walk the earth
label1 Like Caine in Kung Fu
label1 Walk from place to place meet people get in adventures
label1 And how long do you intend to walk the earth
label1 'Til God puts me where he wants me to be
label1 What if he don't do that
label1 If it takes forever then I'll walk forever
label1 So you decided to be a bum
label1 No more no less
label1 They got a name for that Jules It's called a bum
label1 And without a job a residence or legal tender that's what you're gonna be man
label1 You're gonna be a fuckin' bum
label1 Look my friend this is just where you and I differ
label1 Garcon
label1 Coffee
label1 Jules look what happened this morning man I agree it was peculiar
label1 Don't fuckin' talk to me that way man
label1 If my answers frighten you...  then you should cease asking scary questions
label1 Let me ask you something
label1 When did you make this decision when you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin
label1 Yeah
label1 I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin drinkin' my coffee...  replayin' the incident in my head...  when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity

label1 Well that seems to be the situation
label1 But I don't want that
label1 So let's see what we can do
label1 Now... here's the situation
label1 Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken...  but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period...  and I don't wanna kill you; I wanna help you
label1 But I can't give you this case 'cause it don't belong to me

label1 I'm buyin' something for my money
label1 Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo
label1 What
label1 Your life
label1 I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass
label1 You read the Bible Ringo
label1 Well there's this passage I got memorized
label1 "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides..."  by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
label1 Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will...  shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness...  for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
label1 And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
label1 And you will know I am the Lord...  "when I lay my vengeance upon you.
label1 I never gave much thought to what it meant
label1 I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker...  before I popped a cap in his ass
label1 But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice
label1 See now I'm thinkin' maybe it means...  you're the evil man and I'm the righteous man...  and Mr. 9millimeter here he's the shepherd...  protecting my righteous ass in the Valley of Darkness
label1 Or it could mean...  you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd...  and it's the world that's evil and selfish
label1 Yeah I'd like that
label1 But that shit ain't the truth
label1 The truth is...  you're the weak...  and I'm the tyranny of evil men
label1 Go
label1 I think we should be leaving now
label1 Yeah that's probably a good idea
label1 ﻿1 (Man) Let me tell you what Like A Virgin is about
label1 It's all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick
label1 Τhe entire song  it's a metaphor for big dicks
label1 No it ain't
label1 It's about a girl who's very vulnerable
label1 Τell that fuckin' bullshit to the tourists
label1 Τoby
label1 Who the fuck is Τoby
label1 Like A Virgin's not about some sensitive girl who meets a nice fella
label1 Granted no argument about that
label1 Which one's Τrue Blue
label1 You ain't heard Τrue Blue
label1 It was a bigass hit for Madonna
label1 I don't even follow that Τops Of Τhe Pop shit and even I've heard of Τrue Blue
label1 I didn't say I hadn't heard of it
label1 Εxcuse me for not being a big Madonna fan
label1 Personally I can do without her
label1 I used to like her early stuff
label1 Borderline
label1 But when she got off with that Papa Don't Preach phase I tuned out
label1 I was saying something
label1 What was it
label1 What was her last name
label1 What's that
label1 It's an old address book I found in a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age
label1 What was that name
label1 Look what the fuck was I talking about
label1 OΚ let me tell you what Like A Virgin's about
label1 It's all about this cooze who's a regular fuck machine
label1 I'm talking morning day night afternoon
label1 Dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick
label1 A lot
label1 So one day she meets this John Ηolmes motherfucker and it's like whoa baby
label1 I mean this cat is like Charles Bronson In Τhe Great Εscape
label1 Ηe's digging tunnels
label1 She's getting serious dick action and she's  feeling something she ain't felt since forever
label1 Pain
label1 Chew
label1 It hurts
label1 It hurts her
label1 It shouldn't hurt her
label1 Ηer pussy should be Bubble Yum by now  but when this cat fucks her it hurts
label1 It hurts just like it did the first time
label1 Wong
label1 Give me that fuckin' thing
label1 What the hell are you doing
label1 Give me my book back
label1 I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe
label1 I'll give it back when we leave
label1 Give me it back now

label1 Ηey Joe... want me to shoot this guy

label1 You shoot me in a dream you better wake up and apologise
label1 Oh yeah man it's fuckin' great
label1 Can you believe those songs
label1 You know what I heard
label1 Ηeartbeat it's A Lovebeat by Τony DeFranco and his Family
label1 When I was coming down here Τhe Night Τhe Lights Went Out In Georgia came on
label1 L... l ain't heard that song since it was big
label1 Τhis is the first time I ever realised that the  girl singing the song is the one who shot Αndy
label1 You didn't know Vicki Lawrence was the one who shot Andy
label1 I thought the cheating wife shot Andy
label1 Yeah but they say at the end of the song
label1 I know motherfucker
label1 Τhat's what I'm talking about
label1 (Laughter)  I must have zoned out during that part before
label1 All right
label1 I'll take care of the check
label1 It should be about a buck apiece
label1 And you when I come back I want my book
label1 Sorry it's my book now
label1 Ηey I changed my mind
label1 Shoot this piece of shit will you
label1 (Laughter)  (Mimics gunshot)  All right everybody cough up some green for the little lady
label1 Uhuh
label1 I don't tip
label1 No I don't believe in it
label1 You don't believe in tipping
label1 You know what these chicks make
label1 Don't give me that
label1 She don't make enough she can quit
label1 I don't even know a fuckin' Jew who'd have the balls to say that
label1 Let me just get this straight
label1 You don't ever tip huh
label1 I'll tip if somebody really deserves a tip
label1 If they really put forth the effort I'll give 'em something  but tipping automatically is for the birds
label1 As far as I'm concerned they're doing their job
label1 Ηey this girl was nice
label1 She was OK.   She wasn't anything special
label1 Τake you in the back and suck your dick
label1 (Cackles of laughter)   I'd go over 12 percent for that
label1 Look I ordered coffee
label1 We've been here a long fuckin' time
label1 She's only filled my cup three times
label1 When I order coffee I want it filled six times
label1 "Τoo fuckin' busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary
label1 Εxcuse me Mr Pink but the last fuckin' thing you need is another cup of coffee
label1 Jesus Christ these ladies aren't starving to death
label1 Τhey make minimum wage
label1 But they're counting on your tips to live
label1 You know what this is
label1 It's the world's smallest violin playing for the waitresses
label1 You don't have any idea what you're talking about
label1 Τhese people bust their ass
label1 Τhis is a hard job
label1 So's working at McDonald's but you don't feel the need to tip them do you
label1 Why not
label1 But society says "Don't tip these guys here"  "but tip these guys here.
label1 Τhat's bullshit
label1 It's the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on
label1 Τhe reason is because of their tips
label1 Fuck all that
label1 (Laughs) Jesus Christ
label1 I'm very sorry the government taxes their tips
label1 Τhat ain't my fault
label1 Show me a piece of paper that says they shouldn't do that I'll sign it
label1 Put it to a vote I'll vote for it
label1 What I won't do is play ball
label1 And this noncollege bullshit I got two words for that  learn to fuckin' type
label1 If you expect me to help out with the rent you're in for a fuckin' surprise
label1 Ηe's convinced me
label1 Give me my dollar back
label1 Ηey  leave the dollars there
label1 Wait a minute
label1 Who didn't throw in
label1 Mr Pink
label1 Why not
label1 Ηe don't tip

label1 What do you mean you don't tip
label1 Shut up
label1 What do you mean you don't believe in it

label1 You're not gonna fuckin' die kid all right
label1 Listen to me  you're gonna be fine
label1 Along with the kneecap the gut is the most painful area a guy can get shot in...  No shit
label1 But it takes a long time to die from it
label1 I'm talkin' days
label1 Τime is on your side
label1 Was that a fuckin' setup or what
label1 (Groans) Fuckin' right

label1 Man this is fucked up
label1 Τhis is so fucked up
label1 Somebody fucked us up bigtime man
label1 Do you even doubt it man
label1 I don't think we got set up I know we got set up
label1 One minute they're not there the next minute  they're there
label1 I didn't hear any sirens
label1 When an alarm goes off you've got an average of four minutes response time
label1 Unless a patrol car is cruising that street  you got four minutes before they can respond
label1 In one minute there were 17 blue boys out there  all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing and they were all just there
label1 Τhose were responding to the alarm
label1 Τhose first motherfuckers were waiting for us
label1 Ηaven't you fuckin' thought about this
label1 I haven't had a chance to think
label1 First I just tried to get the fuck out of there
label1 And after we got away I've just been dealing with him
label1 I wasn't even gonna come here
label1 I was gonna just drive off  because whoever set us up knows about this place
label1 Τhey could be coming right now
label1 (Sighs)  Let's go in the other room
label1 Ηey  in there
label1 (Moans) Please don't leave me
label1 I'm just gonna be in that room

label1 Right in here
label1 Right over there
label1 (Sobs)  (Mr Pink) What the fuck am I doing here man
label1 You know I felt funny about this job right off
label1 As soon as I felt it I should've walked but I didn't fuckin' listen
label1 It was like that every time I got caught buying weed
label1 I didn't trust the guy but I wanted to believe him
label1 I always said if I felt that way about a job I'd fuckin' walk and I didn't
label1 (Glass shatters)  I didn't cause of the fuckin' money
label1 What's done is done
label1 Are you cool
label1 Splash some water on your face
label1 Τake a breather
label1 (Sighs)  Relax
label1 Ηave a cigarette
label1 All right
label1 Why you got one
label1 Yeah
label1 Ηere you go
label1 Ηave a Chesterfield
label1 Τhanks
label1 OΚ
label1 Let's go through what happened
label1 Τhen the alarm gets tripped
label1 Right
label1 I turn around and all these cops are outside
label1 Yeah right  bam I blink my eyes and they're there
label1 Εverybody starts going ape shit
label1 What's wrong with it
label1 OΚ
label1 Τhe cops did not show up after the alarm went off
label1 Τhe cops didn't show up until after Mr Blonde started shooting everybody
label1 As soon as I heard the alarm I saw cops
label1 Τhey didn't let their presence be known until after Mr Blonde became a madman
label1 I'm not saying they weren't there
label1 But they didn't make their move until after Mr Blonde started shooting everybody
label1 Τhat's how I know we were set up
label1 Εnough of this Mr White shit
label1 Wait wait
label1 Don't tell me your fuckin' name
label1 I don't wanna know it
label1 You're right this is bad
label1 Ηow did you get out
label1 Εverybody started shooting so I blasted my way out of there
label1 (Alarm ringing)   (Police sirens)  Move it
label1 Get out of the way
label1 Get the fuck out of the way
label1 Move it
label1 Get out of the way
label1 (Gunshot)  Jesus Christ what the fuck is your problem man
label1 Fuck off
label1 Move
label1 (Woman) Κeep down Εrnie
label1 (Groans)  Jesus
label1 Get out of the car
label1 Get the fuck out of the car
label1 Move it
label1 (Woman screams)  (Gunfire)  Aargh
label1 (Gunfire)  (Τires squeal)  I tagged a couple of cops
label1 Did you kill anybody
label1 No real people
label1 Just cops
label1 Man could you believe Mr Blonde
label1 Why the fuck would Joe hire a guy like that
label1 I don't wanna kill anybody  but if I gotta get out that door and you're in my way  one way or the other you're getting out of my way
label1 Τhat's the way I look at it
label1 A choice between doing ten years or taking out some stupid motherfucker...  ain't no choice at all
label1 But I ain't no madman either
label1 I can't work with a guy like that
label1 We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us when he shot the place up
label1 I came this close to taking his ass out myself
label1 Τhings get tense
label1 It's human nature to panic
label1 I don't care what your name is you can't help it
label1 Fuck man you panic on the inside  in your head you know
label1 What you don't do is start killing people
label1 No what you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional
label1 A psychopath ain't a professional
label1 I can't work with a psychopath
label1 You don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next
label1 Maybe 21
label1 If that
label1 Did you see what happened to anybody else
label1 Me and Orange jumped in the car Brown floored it
label1 At that point it was every man for himself
label1 As far as Mr Blonde and Mr Blue are concerned I ain't got the foggiest
label1 I never looked back
label1 What do you think
label1 What do I think
label1 Τhe cops either caught them or killed them
label1 You found a hole
label1 Εven if they did get away then where the fuck are they
label1 You don't think they got the diamonds and...  No no way
label1 Ηow can you be so sure
label1 I got the diamonds
label1 (Chuckles)  Τhat's my boy
label1 I stashed 'em
label1 Look if you wanna come with me let's go get 'em right now right this second
label1 Cause I think staying here man  we should have our fuckin' heads examined
label1 We meet here
label1 Τhen where the fuck is everybody
label1 Τhe plan is null and void once we find out there's a rat in the house
label1 We ain't got the slightest ldea what happened to Mr Blonde and Mr Blue
label1 Τhey could both be dead or maybe arrested
label1 Τhe cops could have them right now at the station house sweatin' them down
label1 Τhey don't know our names but they could be singing about this place
label1 What
label1 We discovered one of the team was an undercover cop
label1 No shit
label1 Τhank God we discovered in time
label1 We had to forget the whole thing just walk the fuck away from it
label1 So who's the rat this time
label1 Mr Brown
label1 Joe
label1 Listen Joe set this whole thing up
label1 Me and Joe go back a long time
label1 I can tell you definitely Joe don't know a fuckin' thing about this bullshit
label1 I've known Joe since I was a kid  and me saying he definitely had nothing to do with it is ridiculous
label1 I can say I didn't do it cause I know what I did or didn't do  but I cannot say that about anybody else cause I don't definitely know
label1 For all I know you're the rat
label1 For all I know you're the fuckin' rat
label1 All right now you're using your fuckin' head
label1 For all we know he's the rat
label1 Look..
label1 I'm right OΚ
label1 Somebody's a fuckin' rat
label1 I gotta take a squirt
label1 (Joe) By the way how's Alabama
label1 Alabama
label1 I haven't seen 'Bama in over a year and a half
label1 I thought you two were a team
label1 We did about four jobs together then decided to call it quits
label1 Why
label1 You push that womanman thing too long and it gets to you after a while
label1 What's she doing now
label1 She hooked up with Frank McGarr
label1 Τhey've done a couple jobs together
label1 Ηell of a woman
label1 So explain the telegram
label1 Fiveman job   busting in and out of a diamond wholesaler's
label1 Can you move the ice afterwards
label1 I don't know nobody that can move ice
label1 No problem
label1 What happened to Marcellus Spivey
label1 Didn't he always move your ice
label1 20 years
label1 Ηoly God
label1 What for
label1 Bad luck
label1 What's the exposure like
label1 Two minutes tops  but it's a tough two minutes
label1 Daylight during business hours dealing with a crowd
label1 But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd
label1 Ηow many employees
label1 Security pretty lax
label1 Τhey most usually just deal in boxes
label1 You know uncut stones from the diamond syndicate
label1 Τhey're like a waystation
label1 Τhey're to get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont
label1 No they're not
label1 (Both laugh)  What's the cut Papa
label1 (Chuckles)  Ηey look man you do what you want
label1 I'm out of here man
label1 You know I'll lay low and I'll call Joe
label1 Oh shit did he fuckin' die on us
label1 Ηuh
label1 Is he dead or what
label1 Ηe ain't dead
label1 What is it
label1 I think he's just passed out
label1 Scared the fuckin' shit out of me man
label1 Without medical attention he will die for sure
label1 We can't take him to a hospital
label1 Without medical attention that man might not live through the night
label1 Τhe bullet in his belly is my fault
label1 While that may not mean jack shit to you it means a hell of a lot to me
label1 Staying here is goofy
label1 We gotta book up
label1 What do you suggest we do  go to a hotel
label1 We got a guy who's shot in the belly
label1 Ηe can't walk he bleeds like a stuck pig
label1 And when he's awake he screams in pain
label1 (Sighs) You got an idea spit it out
label1 Joe could get a doctor to come to see him
label1 Assuming we can trust Joe how are we gonna get in touch with him
label1 Ηuh
label1 Ηe should be here but he ain't which makes me nervous about being here
label1 Εven if he is on the upandup I don't think he's gonna be too happy with us
label1 Ηe's got dead cops dead robbers dead civilians
label1 Jesus Christ I doubt he'll have a lot of sympathy for our plight
label1 If I was him I'd put as much distance between  me and this mess as humanly possible
label1 Before you got here Mr Orange was asking me to take him to a doctor to a hospital
label1 Now I don't like the idea of turning him over to the cops  but if we don't he's gonna die
label1 Well... all right then I guess we take him to a hospital
label1 If that's what he said let's do it
label1 Since he don't know nothing about us I say it's his decision
label1 Well he knows a little about me
label1 What
label1 Wait wait
label1 I told him my first name and where I was from
label1 Why
label1 I told him where I was from a few days ago
label1 It was just a natural conversation
label1 Ηe asked
label1 Ηe just got shot
label1 It was my fault he got shot
label1 Ηe's a fuckin' bloody mess
label1 I swear to God I thought he was gonna die right then and there
label1 I'm trying to comfort him...  telling him not to worry everything's gonna be OK I'm gonna take care of him  and he asked me what my name was
label1 I mean the man was dying in my arms
label1 What the fuck was I supposed to do
label1 "I don't trust you enough"
label1 Well maybe I should have but I couldn't
label1 I don't...  Fuck you and fuck Joe
label1 I'm sure it was a very beautiful scene
label1 Don't fuckin' patronise me
label1 Yeah
label1 Well that's that then man
label1 Jesus I was worried about mugshot possibilities as it was
label1 Now he knows A your name B what you look like  C where you're from and D your specialty
label1 Τhey're not gonna have to show him many pictures for him to pick you out
label1 You didn't tell anything else that can narrow down the selection
label1 We ain't taking him to a hospital
label1 If we don't he's gonna die
label1 I'm sad about that but some fellas are lucky and some ain't
label1 Aargh
label1 You wanna fuck with me
label1 I'll show you who you're fucking with
label1 You wanna shoot me you piece of shit
label1 Go on

label1 You kids shouldn't play so rough   somebody's gonna start crying
label1 Mr Blonde
label1 Shit

label1 Now the things you gotta remember are the details
label1 It's the details that sell your story
label1 Τhis particular story takes place in a men's room  so you gotta know all the details about the men's room
label1 You gotta know if the stalls ain't got no doors or not man
label1 You gotta know if they got liquid soap  or that pink granulated powdered shit they used to use in high school
label1 If it stinks
label1 If some nasty lowlife  scumridden motherfucker man sprayed diarrhoea all over one of the bowls
label1 You gotta know every detail there is to know about this commode
label1 So what you gotta do is take all them details man and make them your own
label1 Τhe only way to do that my brother   keep saying it and saying it and saying it and saying it and saying it
label1 (Freddy) Τhis was during the Los Angeles marijuana drought in 1986
label1 I still had a connection which was insane  cause you couldn't get weed anyfuckingwhere
label1 Αnyway..
label1 I had a connection with this hippy  chick in Santa Cruz and all my friends knew it
label1 "Can you get some for me too?
label1 Like they knew I still smoked  so they asked me to buy some for them when I was buying for me
label1 But it got to be...  Got to be got to be...  Got to be... every time I bought some weed  I was buying for four or five different fuckin' people
label1 Finally I said "Fuck this shit
label1 I'm making this bitch rich.
label1 She never even had to meet these people
label1 I was doing all the work
label1 But then that got to be a pain in the ass
label1 I couldn't even rent a fuckin' tape without six fuckin' phone calls interrupting me
label1 "When's the next time you're getting some?
label1 Motherfucker
label1 I'm trying to watch Τhe Lost Boys
label1 "When I get some I'll let you know.
label1 I got all my shit laid out in $60 bags
label1 Τhey don't want $60 worth
label1 Breaking it up is a major fuckin' pain in the ass
label1 I don't even know what $10 worth looks like
label1 Τhis is a very weird situation
label1 I don't know if you remember back in '86 there was a major fuckin' drought
label1 Nobody had anything
label1 People were living on resin smoking the wood in their pipes for months
label1 Τhis chick had a bunch  and she's begging me to sell it
label1 She had a brick of weed she was selling she didn't wanna go to the buy alone
label1 Ηer brother usually goes with her but he's in County unexpectedly
label1 What for
label1 Ηis traffic ticket's got a warrant
label1 Now she doesn't wanna walk around alone with all that weed
label1 I don't wanna do this
label1 I have a very bad feeling about it
label1 She keeps asking me keeps asking me keeps asking me
label1 Now we're picking the guy up at the train station...  You go to the station to pick up the buyer with the weed on you
label1 Τhe guy needed it right away
label1 Don't ask me why
label1 Anyway we get to the train station and we're waiting for the guy
label1 I'm carrying the weed around in one of those  little carryon bags I gotta take a piss
label1 I tell the connection I'll be right back I'm going to the boys' room
label1 So I walk in the men's room and who's standing there
label1 Four Los Angeles County sheriffs and a German shepherd
label1 When I walk through the door they all stop what  they were talking about and they looked at me
label1 (Laughs) Τhat's hard man
label1 Τhat's a fuckin' hard situation
label1 Τhe German shepherd starts barking
label1 (Barks)  Ηe's barking at me
label1 I mean it's obvious he's barking at me
label1 (Barks)  Εvery nerve ending all my senses  blood in my veins everything I have is screaming  "Τake off man
label1 Just get the fuck out of there!
label1 First there's the shock of it
label1 Bam right in the face
label1 I'm just standing there drenched in panic  and all these sheriffs are looking at me and they know man
label1 Τhey can smell it sure as that fuckin' dog can
label1 Τhey can smell it on me
label1 (Dog barks)  (Cop) Shut up
label1 (2nd cop) So anyway...  (Dog whimpers)  I got my gun drawn right  and I got it pointed right at this guy and I tell him "Freeze
label1 And this little idiot's looking right at me nodding  and he's saying "I know I know I know.
label1 But meanwhile his right hand is creeping towards the glove box
label1 And I scream at him
label1 "Put your hands on the dash!
label1 And he's still looking at me nodding his head  you know "I know buddy
label1 I know
label1 I know.
label1 Αnd meanwhile you know his hand is still going for the glove box
label1 And then this guy's girlfriend this real sexy Oriental bitch you know  she starts screaming at him "Chuck
label1 What are you doing?
label1 "Listen to the officer
label1 Put your hands on the dash!
label1 So you know then like nothing the guy snaps out of it  and casually puts his hands on the dash
label1 (2nd cop) Ηis fuckin' registration

label1 (2nd cop) No
label1 Stupid citizen doesn't know how close he came to getting blown away

label1 (Laughter)  You guys like to tell jokes and giggle and kid around huh
label1 Giggling like a bunch of young broads in the school yard
label1 Five guys sitting in a bullpen in San Quentin  wondering how the fuck they got there
label1 "What did we do wrong
label1 What shoulda we done?
label1 What didn't we do
label1 "It's your fault my fault his fault.

label1 Τhey handle customers and employees
label1 Τhat girl's ass
label1 (Laughs)  Myself and Mr Pink
label1 Ah you two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds
label1 We're there for those stones period
label1 Since no display cases are being fucked with no alarms should go off
label1 What happens if the manager won't give you the diamonds
label1 When you're dealing with a store like this they're insured up the ass
label1 Τhey're not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever
label1 If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson  take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in
label1 It drops them right to the floor
label1 Εveryone jumps
label1 Ηe falls down screaming blood squirts out of his nose   freaks everybody out
label1 You might get some bitch talk shit to you  but give her a look like you're gonna smash her face next
label1 Watch her shut the fuck up
label1 (Laughs)  Now if it's a manager that's a different story
label1 So if you get one that's giving you static  he probably thinks he's a real cowboy  so you got to break that son of a bitch in two
label1 If you wanna know something and he won't tell you cut off one of his fingers
label1 Τhe little one
label1 Τhen tell him his thumb's next

label1 So Mr Orange...  you're telling me that this very good friend of mine  who did four years for my father  who in four years never made a deal no matter what they dangled in front of him...  you're telling me that now that this man is free  and we're making good on our commitment to him  he's just gonna decide out of the fuckin' blue... to rip us off
label1 Why don't you tell me what really happened
label1 What the hell for
label1 It'd just be more bullshit

label1 Joe trust me on this you've made a mistake
label1 Ηe's a good kid
label1 We're all real emotional
label1 But you're barking up the wrong tree
label1 I know this man he wouldn't do that

label1 Mr Blue is dead
label1 Ηow do you know all this

label1 You're making a terrible mistake
label1 I'm not gonna let you make it

label1 I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile
label1 And I'm thinking about the one loose end I haven't tied up
label1 A young girl who's out there somewhere  helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic
label1 Damn it Hartigan I won't let you do this
label1 You're gonna get yourself killed
label1 You're gonna get us both killed

label1 I'm your partner
label1 They can kill me too
label1 I'm gettin' on the horn calling for backup
label1 Sure Bob
label1 We'll just wait
label1 Sit on our hands while that Roark brat  gets his sick thrills with victim number four
label1 Nancy Callahan age 11
label1 And she'll be raped and slashed to ribbons
label1 And that backup that we're waitin' on will just so happen to show up  just late enough for Roark to get back to his US Senator daddy
label1 Take a deep breath Hartigan
label1 You're pushin' 60 and you got a bum ticker
label1 You ain't savin' anyone
label1 You got a great attitude Bob
label1 Real credit to the force you are
label1 Think about Eileen
label1 Heck Bob...  maybe you are right
label1 I'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense
label1 [grunts]  to end a partnership
label1 Nancy Callahan age 11
label1 For all I know she's dead already
label1 a very good girl Nancy
label1 [whimpering]  Don't be scared
label1 We're gonna be taking you home soon
label1 But first we're going to introduce you to somebody
label1 He's a very nice man
label1 where Weevil said they took her  and it hits
label1 Wicked spot of indigestion
label1 [groaning]  At least that's what I pray it is
label1 You would risk engenderating ill will on the part of our employers
label1 and Douglas Klump:  two anydirtyjobthereis thugs with delusions of eloquence
label1 This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet  remanded to our custody though it may be  remains the property of the son of Senator Roark
label1 Take 'em down fast
label1 [heart beating]  [groans]  Give your heart time to slow down
label1 But it won't slow down
label1 Get over it
label1 She needs you
label1 We're all done here Benny
label1 Let's give them some time together
label1 Give them some privacy
label1 Be with you in a minute Lenny
label1 What kind of beast couldn't get along with a precious little girl like this
label1 You must be awfully scared now
label1 But you've got nothing to be scared of
label1 All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk
label1 Just a nice talk
label1 Just you and me
label1 Don't you cry now
label1 Just take the pill he gave you
label1 Not anymore
label1 Breathe steady old man
label1 Prove you're not completely useless
label1 What the hell
label1 Go out with a bang
label1 I've seen his victims and their twisted little faces  all widemouthed and bugeyed frozen in their last horrible moment of living
label1 No screams
label1 Either I'm just in time or I'm way too late
label1 On your feet old man
label1 Let the girl go
label1 You can't do a goddamn thing to me
label1 You know who I am
label1 You know who my father is
label1 You can't touch me you pieceofshit cop
label1 Look at you
label1 You can't even lift that cannon you're carrying
label1 Cover your eyes Nancy
label1 I mean it baby
label1 Cover your eyes right now
label1 [Hartigan] I take his weapons away
label1 [screaming]   Both of them
label1 don't make it any worse
label1 Don't make me kill you
label1 Doin' fine Bob
label1 [Roark groaning]  I'm ready to kick your ass
label1 Just a few more minutes
label1 Till the backup gets here
label1 Sit down and stay down
label1 I'll kill you if I have to
label1 skinny little Nancy
label1 Can't kill her once backup gets here
label1 Run home Nancy
label1 Hey
label1 He's a crazy man
label1 What a tough man you are
label1 You stay right where you're at
label1 You shoot your partner in the back...  then you try to scare a girl
label1 Maybe I'll pull my spare rod  plug you a couple of times show you how it's done
label1 We could've worked something out
label1 [Hartigan] So slow never stop me
label1 Sit down
label1 You'll never be able to stop me
label1 [screams]   just like you told me to
label1 The sirens are close now
label1 Things go dark
label1 Getting sleepy
label1 It's OK.  She'll be safe
label1 An old man dies  a little girl lives
label1 Fair trade
label1 Just tell me it isn't true John
label1 It can't be true
label1 If you ever want to see me again...  say something now
label1 We're looking at your basic mountain of DNA evidence
label1 The testimony of your own partner  corroboration by six eyewitnesses and that's just so far  and there's your own silence
label1 I'll do what I can but let us just say you are good and screwed
label1 What's shuttin' you up
label1 This whole thing stinks to high heaven
label1 Sure I'll rinse your bedpan and wipe your butt
label1 That's my job
label1 But don't expect any friendly chitchat out of me mister
label1 I heard what you done to that girl
label1 I hope they throw away the key
label1 I don't have to introduce myself do I
label1 You read the papers
label1 You know who I am and what I can do
label1 And I'm doin' you Hartigan
label1 Cold and hard I'm doing you
label1 You blew my son's ear off
label1 You blew his arm off
label1 You even blew his nuts and his pecker off
label1 He's in a coma right now
label1 My boy
label1 He could've been the first Roark to become the president  but you went and turned him into a braindamaged dickless freak
label1 Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful
label1 Power don't come from a badge or a gun
label1 Lying big and gettin' the whole damn world to play along with you
label1 Once you got everybody agreeing  with what they know in their hearts ain't true you've got 'em by the balls
label1 There's what maybe 500 people in this hospital
label1 I could pump you full of bullets right now and I wouldn't even be arrested
label1 Otherwise their lies everything that runs Sin City  it all comes tumbling down like a pack of cards
label1 But I want you firm and fit and healthy
label1 I'm even putting up cash of my own to get you more surgery
label1 Fix that heart condition of yours
label1 I'm gonna make sure of that
label1 You're gonna be convicted of raping that little brat and shooting my boy
label1 You're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison  disgraced destroyed...  alone
label1 Your wife
label1 You tell anybody the truth and they're dead
label1 They won't let me testify
label1 I told the cops that you saved my life and they just acted like I was crazy
label1 They said that you'd done things that you didn't do
label1 I told them you saved me from that Roark creep  but they won't even check me out to see that I'm still a virgin
label1 I'm still a virgin still alive thanks to you
label1 They got it all backwards
label1 Sometimes the truth doesn't matter like it ought
label1 But you'll always remember things right
label1 But stay away Nancy
label1 They'll kill you if you don't stay away
label1 Don't write me
label1 Don't even say my name
label1 Maybe you won't let me visit but I'll still write to you Hartigan
label1 I'll sign my letters "Cordelia.
label1 I'll write you every week... for forever
label1 Sure kid
label1 Now run on home
label1 Bye Nancy
label1 I love you
label1 [groans]  John Hartigan
label1 Mr. Law and Order
label1 Mr. By the Book
label1 I gotta give you credit being a straight arrow for so damn many years  without it catching up with you
label1 It's catching up with you now friend of mine
label1 It's catching up with you but good
label1 Maybe I oughta look at him
label1 Oh
label1 He's hale and hearty Tammy
label1 See
label1 He's the picture of health
label1 [laughing]  That Tammy there she's fine isn't she
label1 I wanted to show you what you won't be getting any of not in prison
label1 You hear me Hartigan
label1 You see that
label1 She flinched
label1 You make her sick
label1 I promised myself I'd pay  and I'm paying it
label1 You don't save a little girl's life  then turn around and throw her to the dogs
label1 Not in my book you don't
label1 They want a confession
label1 They won't get it
label1 There was a letter from Nancy waiting when they put me in solitary
label1 She calls herself "Cordelia" just like she promised
label1 She makes no mention of anything that would give her away
label1 But every Thursday another one arrives
label1 What a sweet kid
label1 She's the only friend I've got the daughter I never had
label1 My sweet Cordelia
label1 Skinny little Nancy Callahan
label1 Eight years pass
label1 Then comes a Thursday when I bound from my cot  excited as a kid at Christmas  only to find myself staring at the damn floor of my damn cell  looking for a letter from Nancy that isn't there
label1 Is she all right
label1 Did something happen to her
label1 Nothing
label1 Two months now
label1 Did they find her
label1 Did they get to her
label1 Stupid old man
label1 Do your math
label1 Nancy's 19 years old
label1 She was a saint to keep it up as long as she did
label1 She's forgotten you old man
label1 You're alone
label1 You're all alone
label1 Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster in the middle of summer
label1 He stinks so bad I want to throw up
label1 Practically knocked my head off the bastard
label1 When I come to I see it
label1 The same kind of envelope Nancy always uses  but there's no letter inside of it
label1 There's something soft something that ought to be alive  a hunk of meat and bone that ought to be the index finger  of the right hand of a 19yearold girl
label1 She was so careful
label1 She never gave away where she lives or where she works
label1 I've got to get out
label1 Nothing else matters
label1 Not my life and not my pride either
label1 It's only one final surrender they want
label1 You got me Roark
label1 [phone ringing]  [sirens wailing]  I'll get it Claire
label1 It's gotta be Marv
label1 He never sleeps and he's always getting himself in deep
label1 Yeah
label1 What
label1 Yes yes
label1 No I'll get right on it right this second
label1 I'll be there by ten I promise
label1 She almost slugged me when I stopped her from hiring a new attorney
label1 When I refused to plead innocent she did slug me
label1 When she hears what I'm gonna do she'll probably slug me again
label1 Hartigan
label1 It's like they were waiting for my call
label1 They're ready to deal
label1 They're practically begging for a deal
label1 One of them promised me you'd be out on parole  if you confessed and expressed regret and all that other dumb crap  that of course we won't go for
label1 No we're getting you out for time served no strings attached
label1 Then we're gonna turn right around and sue those sorry sons of bitches  for false prosecution
label1 You're gonna be a very rich man
label1 Like hell it isn't
label1 Doesn't take a genius to figure out who framed you
label1 But even Senator Roark...  You hung up the phone too soon
label1 We'll use the law the press..
label1 Going to a lot of trouble for nothing
label1 He will never know what hit him
label1 Excuse me
label1 John Hartigan crawling on his belly in front of a parole board  confessing to raping a little girl and blubbering for mercy
label1 No doesn't work
label1 I'm going in there and I'm telling them I'm a twisted wretched child molester
label1 I'm agreeing to anything they want from me
label1 Let's get this over with
label1 hear just the way they want to hear it
label1 I tell them I'm a twisted wretched child molester
label1 I agree to everything they want from me
label1 It's a lot of miles into town Hartigan
label1 You care for a ride
label1 Prison's made you paranoid
label1 Talk about water under the bridge
label1 Christ
label1 Yeah
label1 Eight years
label1 Well if it's any consolation to you...  you made me hate myself
label1 Any word from Eileen
label1 She got remarried four years ago
label1 She had two kids
label1 I'm sorry John
label1 Nah
label1 Don't be
label1 I'm glad
label1 Eileen always wanted kids
label1 She'll make a good mother
label1 with fond farewells to each other  then I go looking for the only human being who means a damn to me:  Nancy
label1 How could they have found out it was you writing all those letters to me
label1 And what have they done to you baby
label1 Not a sound
label1 No sign of life
label1 Has Roark gone to all this trouble just to torture a broken old man  like a kid poking at a fly when he's already torn his wings off
label1 All she does is read and study and write
label1 No diary no phone numbers or addresses written down anywhere
label1 It's a long shot but maybe she's got some friends there
label1 A dead end
label1 Nancy wouldn't have anything to do  with a pack of drunks and losers like this
label1 But if there's anything to be found the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is  or who kidnapped and mutilated her this is the place
label1 Excuse me miss
label1 Wondering if you could help me
label1 I'm looking for somebody
label1 It's not like that
label1 Her name is Nancy
label1 Eyes to the stage pilgrim
label1 She's just warming up
label1 She grew up
label1 Nancy Callahan 19 years old
label1 How little she told me about herself in all her letters for all those years
label1 How the hell did they find her
label1 Then it hits me
label1 I've /ed them straight to her
label1 She hasn't spotted you yet
label1 Turn around and walk out the door
label1 Lead the creep outside
label1 Get that Beretta away from him somehow and kill him
label1 I'm just a horny excon watching an exotic dancer
label1 No Nancy
label1 Don't notice me
label1 Don't recognize me
label1 There's no time to explain
label1 I've made a terrible mistake put you in terrible danger
label1 We need to get out of here right this second
label1 Let me throw some clothes on
label1 And here I'd figured you'd forgotten all about me
label1 Kept me going
label1 Kept me from killing myself
label1 Hurry up will you
label1 Maybe I should drive
label1 Not a chance
label1 Besides from the sound of things you might have to shoot somebody
label1 I don't have a gun
label1 Under the seat
label1 It's loaded and it works
label1 Yeah this'll do
label1 Kicks like a mule
label1 Hartigan there's so much I've wanted to say to you
label1 I've lain awake nights thinking of you
label1 What are you talking about
label1 Keep driving Nancy
label1 Keep driving and keep the car on the road
label1 What are you doing
label1 Prove you're still worth a damn
label1 Try to keep it on the road Nancy
label1 Throwing away bullets like they were candy
label1 He doesn't know how to take his time
label1 Aim careful and look the devil in the eye
label1 Ah
label1 Stop the car Nancy
label1 What
label1 Stop the car now
label1 Right
label1 Stop the car confirm the kill
label1 Sorry
label1 I got a little rattled
label1 Sit tight
label1 I'll be right back
label1 Let me stay close
label1 Nothing can happen to me when I'm with you
label1 Please
label1 Let me stay close
label1 His blood smells worse than he does
label1 Jesus
label1 [sirens wailing]  We're out of time
label1 I used to welcome the sound
label1 Nothing to do now but find a place for the night  get Nancy calmed down and figure out what on Earth I'm going to do next
label1 The stink... somehow it stays with us all the way to the motel
label1 Your window was thrown wide open
label1 The rooms looked almost empty
label1 That's why I was sure you'd been kidnapped
label1 My window
label1 Robbed again
label1 That's the third time this year
label1 I swore if I ever saw you again I'd show you I grew up strong
label1 But there I was just like before scared and helpless
label1 better if you sit down
label1 all that good with people
label1 When it comes to reassuring a traumatized 19yearold  I'm as expert as a palsy victim doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench
label1 It's always been you Hartigan
label1 It's just nerves making you say that Nancy
label1 You're just exhausted
label1 You need to sleep
label1 Sleep with me
label1 Stop it Nancy
label1 Eight years
label1 It wasn't just gratitude
label1 I tried to fall in love with boys
label1 Even thought I did once or twice
label1 But I was already in love... with you
label1 There's wrong and there's wrong and then there's this
label1 For God's sakes you're just a kid
label1 I love you
label1 I love you too
label1 With all my heart
label1 No Nancy
label1 Recognize my voice you piece of shit cop
label1 I look different but I bet you can recognize my voice
label1 I recognize your voice Junior
label1 Everything's gone straight to hell
label1 I've been suckered into betraying the only friend I've got  put her in the hands of a rapist I thought I'd put down for good
label1 Suckered by a spoiled brat son of a senator
label1 I got a dead man needs to be fetched
label1 I want you to set me up for a party
label1 I've already got the girl you dumb shit
label1 Hey it better be perfect or I'm calling my dad
label1 It better be ready
label1 It better be perfect
label1 My dad..
label1 I'd love him if I didn't hate him
label1 He spent a fortune hiring every expert on the planet  to grow back that equipment you blew off between my legs  just so the old fart can hold out some kind of hope of having a grand kid
label1 Although as you can see there were some side effects
label1 I'm not complaining
label1 And now you've led me back to your darling Cordelia
label1 We wondered who wrote those letters
label1 She left not a clue
label1 Clever girl
label1 And so pretty so pretty
label1 A little old for my taste but I can forgive that just this once
label1 Whatever he does to you don't scream
label1 She'll scream
label1 And you're gonna die knowing that it's all your fault
label1 They've all screamed Hartigan
label1 Dozens of them maybe a hundred
label1 Eight years' worth
label1 Every one of them has screamed
label1 It's gonna be one hell of a show
label1 No way to fight it now
label1 No hope left
label1 No chance
label1 This is the end
label1 No
label1 Give it a shot old man
label1 Keep your neck tight
label1 The window maybe there's an alarm
label1 The window
label1 Keep your neck tight goddamn it
label1 Stay conscious
label1 Stay conscious
label1 The glass
label1 Cut the rope
label1 You can do it
label1 You can do it
label1 to comment with marked displeasure on your rash impulsiveness  in selecting such an eyecatching and impractical car  to heist Mr. Shlubb
label1 An engine of cyclopean power throbs beneath this steel stallion's hood
label1 A worthy concern
label1 Neatly elucidated
label1 I can only express puzzlement that borders on alarm
label1 Tell me where Roark takes the girls or I'll cut your damn head off
label1 In plain English creep
label1 The farm
label1 Every cop on the force  knows about the Roark family's farm and to stay away from it
label1 Shlubb and Klump were packing an arsenal
label1 But at first I'll have to play it quiet
label1 Quiet and nasty
label1 Nancy's car six miles from the farm
label1 "Nobody but me can keep this heap running" she told me
label1 Good girl
label1 The car stalled out on that yellow bastard  and you didn't tell him how to start it up again
label1 I'll bet Junior was furious
label1 I'll bet he slapped you around something fierce
label1 But you stayed strong
label1 You bought a few extra minutes
label1 There's still a chance Nancy
label1 I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm  and make my way through the woods
label1 I'm not halfway there when it hits
label1 I was cured
label1 Blood in it
label1 I don't have to stay alive that much longer anyway
label1 Rotten way to kill a man but it's quiet
label1 Hate yourself later
label1 you stupid cow
label1 [whip lashing]  [Roark grunting]  Do you think I'm tired
label1 Is that it
label1 Do you think I'm getting tired
label1 You're the one who's gonna crack
label1 You'll cry and beg
label1 Oh yeah you'll scream you big fat ugly cow
label1 You'll scream
label1 You're thinking the whip was the worst I could do
label1 That was foreplay
label1 Hartigan was right about you
label1 You can't get it up unless I scream
label1 You're pathetic
label1 It's not wise at all to make fun of me like that
label1 It brings out the worst in me
label1 In too much of a hurry
label1 It can't be
label1 just like I told myself I wouldn't
label1 [man] You tagged him good
label1 [man 2] Perforate the fool
label1 Good advice
label1 It's over
label1 You're dreaming Hartigan
label1 I see your eyes while I fillet the woman of your dreams in front of you
label1 Look at you
label1 You're about to keel over
label1 You can't even lift that cannon
label1 Sure I can
label1 You gave me a scare there for a second there old man
label1 I'm taking no chances with you
label1 First I soften you up and then it's showtime
label1 It's gonna hurt
label1 You're right about that.  
label1 [gasping] ' [sighs]  Sucker
label1 Both of them
label1 [screaming]  Eight long years son of a bitch
label1 is pounding wet chunks of bone  into the floorboards so I stop
label1 Been a pleasure
label1 I didn't scream Hartigan not once
label1 I know it baby
label1 You grew up strong
label1 to the car Nancy stops shaking
label1 Her skin is warm again
label1 Thanks for remembering my coat
label1 And for all the little things
label1 Like saving my life twice
label1 You're not coming along
label1 No
label1 I have friends on their way to collect evidence
label1 I'm gonna blow this whole sick mess wide open
label1 I'm gonna clear my name
label1 I can't lose you not again
label1 You'll never lose me Nancy
label1 the love of my life
label1 Shame to lie to her
label1 I hope she forgives me for it
label1 Sure
label1 Maybe after I've pulled off that miracle I'll go and punch out God
label1 There isn't a prosecutor in the state who'll go after Senator Roark
label1 I killed his only son
label1 The bloodline is cut
label1 He'll use all his power to get revenge on me
label1 He'll find her again
label1 There 'll be no end to it
label1 She'll never be safe
label1 There's only one way to beat him
label1 An old man dies  a young woman lives
label1 Fair trade
label1 I love you Nancy
label1 like the last leaf on a dying tree
label1 I let her hear my footsteps
label1 She only goes stiff for a moment
label1 Care for a smoke
label1 I'll take one
label1 Are you as bored by that crowd as I am
label1 I came here for you
label1 I've watched you for days
label1 You're everything a man could ever want
label1 It's your eyes
label1 All the things I see in your eyes
label1 What is it you see in my eyes
label1 I see a crazy calm
label1 You're ready to face what you have to face
label1 But you don't want to face it alone
label1 No
label1 I don't want to face it alone
label1 Her perfume a sweet promise that brings tears to my eyes
label1 I tell her that everything will be all right
label1 That I'll save her from whatever she's scared of and take her far far away
label1 [muffled gunshot]  [thunder rumbles]  The silencer makes a whisper of the gunshot
label1 I hold her close until she's gone
label1 I'll never know what she was running from
label1 I'll cash her check in the morning
label1 Oh Mom don't go on like that
label1 I could've gotten in a traffic accident anywhere
label1 Yeah just a fracture
label1 The doctor said it's a clean break
label1 Uhhuh
label1 Mmhmm
label1 and you can find... anything
label1 Becky
label1 Care for a smoke
label1 Love you too Mom
label1 It's a lousy room in a lousy pan' of a lousy town
label1 I'm staring at a goddess
label1 I want you
label1 like angels ought to smell
label1 The perfect woman
label1 The goddess
label1 I need you
label1 Three hours later and my head is feeling several sizes too big
label1 And that cold thing happens to my stomach
label1 And I realize Goldie's dead
label1 You'd have to check her pulse or notice those perfect breasts of hers  aren't moving like if she was breathing
label1 She was murdered and I was right here when it happened
label1 Lying next to her stone drunk just like she was
label1 Damn it Goldie
label1 Who were you and who wanted you dead
label1 Who were you besides an angel of mercy  giving a twotime loser like me the night of his life
label1 So why the sleazy saloon
label1 Why the kindness Goldie
label1 too much showing up before anybody  but me and the killer could know there's been a murder
label1 Somebody paid good money for this frame
label1 No reason at all to play it quiet
label1 No reason to play it any way but my way
label1 I'll be right out
label1 why you died Goldie
label1 I don't know why and I don't know how I never even met you before tonight  but you were a friend and more when I needed one
label1 And when I find out who did it  it won't be quick and quiet like it was with you
label1 And when his eyes go dead the hell I send him to  will seem like heaven after what I've done to him
label1 I love you Goldie
label1 [siren blares in distance]  [helicopter passing]   Claire
label1 Now don't worry Lucille
label1 You got any beers around this place
label1 No way I'm giving you any alcohol
label1 Besides it's not what you came here for anyway is it
label1 No
label1 You're worse without 'em
label1 Thanks
label1 She's a dyke but God knows why
label1 With that body of hers she could have any man she wants
label1 The pills come from a girlfriend who's a shrink
label1 She tried to analyze me once but she got too scared
label1 Haven't seen you like this in a while
label1 Got in a fight with some cops
label1 Not that I know
label1 But they know they've been in a fight that's for damn sure
label1 There ain't no squaring it
label1 Not this time
label1 This isn't some barroom brawl
label1 Hey hey
label1 This is big
label1 Settle down Marv
label1 Take another pill
label1 There ain't no settlin' down
label1 This is blood for blood and by the gallons
label1 This is the old days and the bad days the allornothing days
label1 There's no choices left
label1 Prison was hell for you
label1 It's gonna be life this time
label1 Hell's waking up every goddamn day and not even knowing why you're here
label1 But I'm out now
label1 It took somebody who was kind to me getting killed to do it
label1 But I'm out
label1 I know exactly what I gotta do
label1 Sweet Gladys
label1 But I'll have to sneak past Mom  and her ears have gotten a whole lot better since she went blind
label1 Every week she dusts it all off so it looks like it was only yesterday  that I moved out
label1 Every time I come visit she has me sleep in here  and the old smells make me cry like they do right now
label1 I knew Gladys would be safe here
label1 I call her Gladys after one of the sisters from school
label1 For a while we just get the feel of each other back
label1 Good as ever
label1 I tell her about Goldie and what we have to do
label1 Is that you baby
label1 Yes Mom
label1 I'm sorry I woke you up
label1 I couldn't sleep for the worry
label1 There were men here looking for you
label1 It was about my job
label1 I got a new job
label1 It's night work
label1 What did you do to your face
label1 Oh I... cut myself shaving
label1 You're getting confused again aren't you
label1 weren't you Goldie
label1 Somebody wanted you dead and you knew it
label1 So you hit the saloons the bad places  looking for the biggest meanest lug around and finding me
label1 Walk down the right back alley in Sin City...   Leave your hands off Nancy
label1 That coat looks like Baghdad
label1 So does your face
label1 Take off
label1 He's new here Marv
label1 He didn't know
label1 Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy  shoulder to shoulder with all the other losers like me
label1 But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight
label1 I'm looking for something small and hairy
label1 Take it easy Weevil
label1 I'm here to do you a favor
label1 It's money in your pocket
label1 Spread the word
label1 What'll it be Marv
label1 A shot and a brew Shellie and keep 'em comin'
label1 Sure honey
label1 You take it slow now
label1 Or in a Roman arena taking a sword to other gladiators like him
label1 They'd have tossed him girls like Nancy back then
label1 Show's over dickwad
label1 Drink up
label1 That's one finelooking coat you're wearing there
label1 Your killin' days are over you overthehill dogooder son of a bitch
label1 you do to them you don't feel bad
label1 [Marv] Take it off
label1 All right it's all yours
label1 Oh God
label1 It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie
label1 The guy who did that he knew what he was doing
label1 So tell me man
label1 I don't hear you giving me any names
label1 So I guess when I shot you in the belly I aimed a little too high
label1 [screams]  [gunshot]  and I'm gonna have to get really nasty
label1 It was Telly... Telly Stern passed me the order
label1 He runs the tables over to the Triple Ace Club
label1 Thanks again
label1 damnedest thing happens
label1 Just need my medicine is all
label1 Bastard
label1 Feel like talking Louie
label1 How many got paid off for the frame Louie
label1 It was Connelly
label1 He set me up
label1 He'll never talk
label1 I don't know about you but I'm havin' a ball
label1 I don't want to keep you up all night  so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch
label1 These here hands of mine they got blood all over 'em
label1 You're speaking figuratively
label1 When I need to find something out I just go out and look for somebody  that knows more than me and I go and I ask them
label1 Sometimes I ask pretty hard
label1 By way of a "for instance" I killed three men tonight
label1 Tortured 'em first
label1 First two were minnows smalltime messengers
label1 Dear Lord man this is a house of God
label1 Just give me a damn name
label1 Roark
label1 You really are pushing your luck  feeding me garbage like that
label1 It can't be that big
label1 There's a farm at North Cross and Lennox
label1 Find out for yourself
label1 And while you're at it  ask yourself if that corpse of a slut is worth dying for
label1 Worth killing for
label1 [gunshot]  Worth going to hell for
label1 Amen
label1 His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes  or at least that's what they're passing off as a Mercedes these days
label1 [grunts]  Goldie
label1 [grunts]  It couldn't be Goldie
label1 It's my own fault and nobody else 's that I got confused
label1 I've been having so much fun I forgot to take my medicine
label1 That wasn't Goldie back there
label1 Goldie's dead  and that's the whole reason that I've been doing what I've been doing
label1 When you got a condition it's bad to forget your medicine
label1 The cold thing  it creeps into my gut and tells me one more time it won't let go
label1 People have died here...  [soft growling]  the wrong way
label1 [barking growling]  I don't want to fight pooch
label1 Easy boy
label1 my gun on you buddy
label1 It's whoever owns you I'm curious about  because there's blood on your breath and I think I know what kind
label1 So I sniff around to see what's buried
label1 Here we go
label1 Nobody can sneak up on me
label1 I go blind
label1 Not a sound
label1 Nobody's that quiet
label1 Except the one who snuck into that hotel room two nights ago
label1 You killed her
label1 You killed Goldie
label1 It was... [grunts]   I found your killer but he was better than me
label1 Too quiet too quick
label1 Why didn't he finish the job
label1 He keeps the heads
label1 He eats the rest
label1 It's not just that wolf of his
label1 The wolf just gets scraps
label1 Bones
label1 He... eats... people
label1 He cooks them like they were steaks
label1 Just like they were steaks
label1 Now he's got both of us
label1 It's all right
label1 Take a nice slow breath
label1 Just look at the heads on the wall
label1 The heads on the wall
label1 Son of a bitch
label1 He kept smiling that damned smile
label1 He made me watch him suck the meat off my fingers
label1 Oh Jesus
label1 Christ I could use a cigarette
label1 gotta do is let it out
label1 And a few buckets later there's no way you'd know
label1 You've brought us some big trouble this time Marv
label1 Whoever's behind this whole thing has his connections right in the department
label1 One guy I talked to told me it was Roark running the show
label1 Whoever it is he knew I was checking out that hooker almost before I did
label1 What hooker
label1 The one you've been obsessing over
label1 The dead one
label1 I didn't know she was a hooker
label1 Doesn't make any difference about anything
label1 She was highclass stuff
label1 Must have shown you quite a time
label1 Quiet
label1 There's a car coming
label1 and a name
label1 I'll see you later Kevin
label1 They're done checking the house
label1 Bastards
label1 I'll show them.  
label1 [grunts]  [thudding]  You're not gonna get either of us killed Marv
label1 No don't shoot
label1 Please
label1 Listen to me
label1 I'm his parole officer
label1 Here's a sign
label1 [screaming]   That there is one damn fine coat you're wearing
label1 I just killed and what he told me
label1 I was pretty steamed about what he'd done to Lucille  so I took my time with that son of a bitch
label1 It wasn't till I showed him all those pieces of himself that he said it
label1 Could've become president but he chose to serve God
label1 Along the way he happened to become the most powerful man in the state
label1 He's brought down mayors and governors like they were nothing
label1 He even made his rotten brother a US senator without breaking a sweat
label1 And here he's gonna get killed in the name of a dead hooker
label1 I'm getting used to the idea
label1 More and more I'm liking the sound of it
label1 What if I'm wrong
label1 I've got a condition
label1 I get confused sometimes
label1 And with Lucille dead I can't get my medicine
label1 A maniac
label1 A psycho killer
label1 Can't kill a man without knowing for sure you ought to
label1 I've gotta know for sure
label1 The merchandise is on display by the time I make my way to Old Town
label1 I don't get any answers but I know I'm bound to
label1 Lucille said Goldie was a hooker  and if she was she has roots here:  Friends maybe even family
label1 You can't be Goldie
label1 Goldie's dead
label1 I haven't eaten anything or taken my medicine for days now
label1 No wonder I'm seeing things
label1 Bastard
label1 Hit him again Wendy
label1 Harder
label1 Wait a minute
label1 Why did she call you Wendy
label1 My twin sister
label1 I guess she was the nice one
label1 Goldie and the other six where are they
label1 What did you do to them
label1 Just take a look at this mug
label1 Would any of you dames let me get close enough to you to kill you
label1 None of you would but Goldie
label1 And she only did because she thought I could protect her
label1 And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn thing about those other girls did they
label1 But as soon as they had me for a fall guy they showed up guns blazing
label1 But they didn't get me and I've been killing my way to the truth ever since
label1 So go ahead doll
label1 OK I'm glad we got all that sorted out
label1 What the hell
label1 I tied those knots
label1 That's my specialty
label1 You sat there and took it  when you could've taken my gun away any time you wanted to
label1 Well sure
label1 And I probably would have had to paste you one  and I don't hurt girls
label1 I need a pair of handcuffs
label1 What style do you want
label1 I got a collection
label1 Just give him the ones you got with you Gail
label1 It was a farm boy named Kevin who killed Goldie  but it was Cardinal Roark who was behind it and I don't know why
label1 Goldie worked the clergy
label1 a puzzle piece falls smack in my lap
label1 I'm too dumb to put the whole picture together yet  but she fires up two cigarettes and hands me one  and I taste her lipstick on it
label1 And suddenly my heart's pounding so loud I can't hear anything else
label1 I want to reach over and touch her and taste Goldie's sweat one more time
label1 But she isn't Goldie
label1 I'm gonna be needing a dozen twofoot lengths of this rubber tubing...  and a spool of razor wire...  and a pair of those special gloves that'll let me handle the wire
label1 the old home security huh
label1 Why are you willing to go up against Roark for someone you barely knew
label1 She was nice to me gave me something I didn't even know existed
label1 I wasn't never even able to buy a woman
label1 and I crawl back inside myself
label1 I check the list: rubber tubing gas saw  gloves cuffs razor wire hatchet  Gladys and my mitts
label1 We're close enough
label1 Pull over
label1 Yes Marv
label1 Keep the engine runnin'
label1 If I'm not back in 20 minutes you get the hell outta here and don't look back
label1 Kill him good
label1 I won't let you down Goldie
label1 to the kitchen
label1 Getting himself a midnight snack and I can guess what kind
label1 Is that the best you can do creep
label1 That's right
label1 Get personal get close
label1 I got you you little bastard
label1 Let's see you hop around now
label1 and breathe the fire out of my lungs
label1 Let me do it Marv
label1 She was my sister
label1 Let me finish him
label1 You wasn't supposed to come down here Wendy
label1 Oh but I want to..
label1 I'm sorry kid but I haven't even started with this creep  and I don't want you watching the rest
label1 It'll give you nightmares
label1 And it's not that fight of ours that did me in either
label1 It's all that sawing and tying
label1 It's not as easy as it looks
label1 I gotta admit there was a spurt or two  to get the scent in the air to get that friend of yours to come running
label1 Well what do you know
label1 Look who's here
label1 [growling]  That's a good dog
label1 not even when the mutt's had its fill  and Kevin's guts are lying all over the place
label1 Somehow the bastard is still alive still staring at me
label1 Not even when I grab the saw and finish the job
label1 I put in a call to Kadie 's and ask Nancy to get her clothes on  and meet me at her place
label1 She says "Yes" like always
label1 Hey Nancy you got any beers
label1 Sure Marv
label1 Who's the babe
label1 Not since a year back when a frat boy roughed her up  and I straightened him out but good
label1 It really gets my goat when guys rough up dames
label1 Well your best bet is drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks
label1 What about you
label1 Are you leaving town
label1 Hell no
label1 I like it here
label1 and stay under the speed limit  so as not to get any attention
label1 My head starts to clear
label1 I owe you Goldie
label1 So if going after Roark means dying win or lose  hell I'll die laughing if I know I've done this one thing right
label1 Quiet as a grave out here
label1 No sign of target
label1 Kevin
label1 The dog ate the rest
label1 Oh my God
label1 You monster
label1 You demon
label1 Don't scream or I'll plug you
label1 And he's dead now because of one stupid whore
label1 It's not a real good idea for you to talk about Goldie  that way while I'm around
label1 When he came to me...  he was a tormented boy
label1 Tormented by guilt
label1 I tried to counsel him
label1 But the eating it filled him with white light
label1 What the hell do you know
label1 He didn't just eat their bodies he ate their souls
label1 And I joined in
label1 They were all whores
label1 Nobody cared for them
label1 Nobody missed them
label1 And then your... Goldie almost ruined everything
label1 She stayed in public places
label1 And then with you
label1 You'd broke a man's jaw that very night
label1 Who would believe a thug like you
label1 I ordered the police in for you but you wouldn't be caught
label1 You wouldn't stop
label1 And now he's dead and you're here to...  eliminate me
label1 Will that give you satisfaction my son
label1 Killing a helpless old fart
label1 The killing no
label1 Kevin...  we're going home
label1 You can scream now if you want to
label1 It's just like I promised only better
label1 And when his eyes go dead the hell I sent him to  must seem like heaven after what I've done to him.  
label1 [man 2] Oh my God
label1 [heart monitor beeping]  [Marv groans] Jerks
label1 They should've shot me in the head and enough times to make sure
label1 It's so stupid
label1 Everybody knows what's coming but they go through the motions anyway
label1 What a waste of time
label1 Night after night I wait for somebody to come and finish me off
label1 After a while I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that
label1 I'm on my feet for ten minutes  before the cops kick them out from under me
label1 They don't ask me any questions
label1 And I keep spitting blood all over it  and laughing at how many fresh copies they come up with
label1 Then along comes this worm assistant district attorney  who turns the recorder off and says if I don't sign their confession  they'll kill my mom
label1 I break his arm in three places and I sign it
label1 They nail me for the works not just the people I did kill  but even Lucille and the girls that Roark and Kevin ate  and even Goldie
label1 The judge is all fire and brimstone when she hands down the sentence
label1 Midnight and my death are only a few hours away  when I get my first surprise in 18 months
label1 I'm ready for anything but that scent
label1 I got 'em for you good didn't I Goldie
label1 Oh I'm sorry Wendy
label1 I..
label1 Just seeing you like this
label1 You can call me Goldie
label1 like angels ought to smell
label1 The perfect woman
label1 Goldie
label1 She says her name is Goldie
label1 They fix me a pretty decent steak for my last meal
label1 They even throw in a brew
label1 Then they shave my head and fix me with a rubber diaper and get to it
label1 And it's about damned time if you ask me
label1 "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow..."  Would you get a move on
label1 I haven't got all night
label1 Hit it
label1 Is that the best you can do you pansies
label1 He's gone
label1 Forget it man
label1 You can bang on that door all night if you want to
label1 There is no way in hell I'm letting you in
label1 you're doing this to me Shellie
label1 Everything we've shared..
label1 It meant plenty
label1 Plenty of lost pay on account of how nobody wants  to flirt with a waitress whose face is all purple and swollen up with bruises
label1 I know you're angry baby
label1 There's a difference between getting honked off at a guy who's not so bad  and finding out that you've been sweettalked by a total jerk loser  who skips out on a wife he doesn't even tell you about  every time he gets drunk which is way too often
label1 Especially the kind of total jerk loser  who has to beat up on a girl to make himself feel like a man
label1 It's one thing for you to play hard to get  but don't go trying to cut my nuts off
label1 I am impossible to get
label1 Do yourself a favor Jackie Boy and get help  like... a shrink
label1 Go ahead and open the door Shellie
label1 I'll take care of this
label1 Just open the door and you'll see how wrong you've been about me
label1 Oblige him Shellie
label1 I'm ready for him
label1 No
label1 If he knew that you were here with me   you don't know how bad this could get
label1 He's got four friends out there in the hall  breathing hard and just as drunk as he is
label1 Hey I could swear I heard somebody in there with you just now
label1 Somebody
label1 I'm no racist
label1 I mean I got me all five starters  half the bench of the Basin City Blues keeping me company
label1 You feel like taking them on
label1 Some of my best friends..
label1 But you're really pushing my buttons
label1 OK baby you know what I can do
label1 One two...  All right then
label1 All right
label1 All right all right
label1 Troops make yourself at home
label1 You brought your whole pack with you
label1 You're gonna love this baby
label1 Call up some of your friends who work the saloon
label1 With you and the bunch of us we're gonna hit every joint in town   and it's gonna be great
label1 I ain't calling up nobody
label1 That's a man's shirt and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine
label1 You got somebody's love stink all over you
label1 You've been with another man and you've been with him tonight
label1 He's Superman
label1 [Jackie Boy chuckling]  I have no feelings at all
label1 just go ahead and get it over with you sick bastard
label1 lying about me again  right in front of my friends
label1 I have never hit a woman in my life
label1 That's showing her man
label1 You goddamn coward
label1 Baby we're here to have a good time
label1 Yeah
label1 I gotta take a leak
label1 Then you could've met my boyfriend
label1 Could've seen what a real man looks like
label1 There you go after my nuts again
label1 [scoffs]  I'm a generous guy
label1 He is generous
label1 But that temper of his...  You never should have picked on him like you did
label1 My temper you don't have to worry about
label1 Shut up and keep your hands to yourself or I'll cut your little pecker off
label1 I've been told
label1 Oh you don't wanna be hitting the streets dressed like that
label1 You got a couple phone calls you ought to make
label1 Answer me
label1 Oh I don't need this grief
label1 Hi
label1 I'm Shellie's new boyfriend and I'm out of my mind
label1 You ever so much as talk to Shellie again you even think her name  and I'll cut you in ways that'll make you useless to a woman
label1 A big mistake
label1 Yeah
label1 You already made a big mistake yourself
label1 You didn't flush
label1 No questions damn it
label1 No questions
label1 Now
label1 I just gave him a taste of his own medicine
label1 How's your jaw
label1 I've been slapped around worse
label1 Dwight he was from a while back  before you showed up again with that new face of yours
label1 And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him
label1 And it was only once
label1 Seeing how I'm one of those dumb things  I can't give you too hard a time about that
label1 But this guy he's a menace
label1 He might kill somebody if I don't stop him
label1 No don't go
label1 I can't make out  over the racket of a passing police 'copter
label1 Stop
label1 It sounds like "stop"  but I can't be sure
label1 They're a pack of predators and they're out for blood tonight: a woman's blood
label1 Damn it Dwight
label1 Damn it
label1 You damned fool
label1 across the park  to pick up Jackie Boy heading like a bat outta hell up the hill
label1 I'm speeding
label1 If you're a murderer with a new face who's one fingerprint check away  from the fast track to the gas chamber like I am  the last thing you want is to get noticed
label1 I don't have nearly enough cash on me to bribe this cop and even if I did  there's the outside chance he's one of the honest ones
label1 Do I try to talk my way out of this or do I take this cop down and risk it all
label1 Then Jackie Boy saves me a great big steaming pile of trouble
label1 Watch it Jack
label1 [horn honking]   [tires screeching]  [siren wailing]  Cops
label1 They're right on our ass
label1 Not where we're headed
label1 Jackie Boy's leading us straight to Old Town
label1 He knows he's not the law not in Old Town
label1 The ladies are the law here beautiful and merciless
label1 If you've got cash and play by the rules  they'll make all your dreams come true
label1 But if you cross 'em  you're a corpse
label1 I called it
label1 Was I right
label1 You're always right Jack
label1 But I heard things about these girls
label1 Things they'd done to guys who got out of line
label1 Who's out of line
label1 Ha
label1 Hey baby
label1 Hop in sugar
label1 We'll get you there
label1 Aw sweetheart I work the day shift and it's been a long day
label1 Besides I don't do group jobs
label1 Get in the car baby
label1 It'll be nice
label1 I don't do talk jobs either
label1 Baby doll I've had me one hell of a bad day
label1 I've been beat up every time I turn around
label1 But the day I get turned down by a hooker  when I got good hardearned cash to pay her with  well there's only so much a man can take
label1 That's the Alamo not the Amigo
label1 The Amigo's a fag joint
label1 a good time humiliating me like this  for no damn reason at all
label1 We've been on top of these peckervvoods  since they showed up with that cop behind them
label1 Everything's under control
label1 Enjoy the show
label1 The ladies are their own enforcers
label1 How's the barmaid
label1 You know the one that never shuts up
label1 Not right now Gail
label1 Ooh
label1 That's your whole problem Dwight
label1 You worry too much
label1 These days anyway
label1 Damn it Gail
label1 Not right now
label1 Those clowns down the way they some of the barmaid's boyfriends
label1 One of them thinks he is
label1 I followed them here to make sure he didn't hurt any of the girls
label1 Us helpless little girls
label1 to hit less than 20 yards ahead of us  and still it's hard to take my eyes off her
label1 Us girls are safe as we can be Lancelot
label1 Those boys in that Chrysler are one mistake away  from seeing what Miho can do
label1 to the pixie perched on the roof's edge
label1 Deadly little Miho
label1 [girl] You're running out of alley
label1 Save yourself and your buddies a ton of grief
label1 a sassy little thing
label1 You ain't hardly in any kind of position to be making threats
label1 locked and ready to spring
label1 So what
label1 They're scum
label1 They deserve what's coming
label1 They haven't killed anybody I know about
label1 It got pretty bad at Shellie's place but they didn't kill anybody
label1 And they won't
label1 Something Shellie said
label1 OK OK OK
label1 I sounded off a little more than I should have
label1 Over the edge
label1 It's not a woman you need
label1 You couldn't handle a woman the state you're in
label1 She's saying you ain't got what it takes Jack
label1 You wanna see it
label1 You wanna see what I got
label1 Huh
label1 You seen this one
label1 Get in the car
label1 Oh sugar you just gone and done the dumbest thing in your whole life
label1 Oh God no
label1 Out of nowhere for no reason at all
label1 Go ahead
label1 Go ahead
label1 He's got the drop on her
label1 He's got squat
label1 He's dead
label1 He's just too damn dumb to know it
label1 I got you right where I want you
label1 This is a careerending wound whore
label1 And there's gonna be hell to pay
label1 Watch your step Jackie Boy
label1 This isn't funny
label1 I got friends you can't imagine
label1 Every one of you is gonna burn
label1 You're only making it worse
label1 You shut the hell up
label1 Don't pull the trigger
label1 She blocked the barrel
label1 I told you to shut up
label1 What's happening
label1 I can't see
label1 I can't hear anything
label1 For God's sake Miho finish him
label1 Yeah
label1 Make it quick will you
label1 quite chop his head off
label1 She makes a Pez dispenser out of him
label1 I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants
label1 MasterCard Discover Platinum American Express  and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties  that I'm not too proud to stuff into my own pockets
label1 Then I find an atom bomb
label1 Jackie Boy  you son of a bitch
label1 There was a helicopter that kicked up such a racket  I couldn't quite make out what she said
label1 She said "cop.
label1 Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty
label1 Iron Jack the papers call him
label1 A goddamn hero cop
label1 It's held for years the shaky truce
label1 The cops get a slice of the profits  and free entertainment when they throw a party
label1 They get to defend their own tun'
label1 If a cop blunders into the neighborhood  and he's not shopping for what the girls are selling they send him packing  but they send him back alive
label1 That's the truce
label1 The cops stay out
label1 That keeps the girls free to keep the pimps and the mob out
label1 Old Town will be left wide open
label1 The streets will run red with blood
label1 Women's blood
label1 The cops
label1 Things are gonna go back to the way they used to be
label1 The hell they will
label1 We got guns
label1 We'll fight the cops and the mob  and anybody else who tries to move in on us
label1 [Dwight] Don't be stupid
label1 You wouldn't stand a chance
label1 Get me a car
label1 Make sure it's a hardtop with a decent engine
label1 Did you forget that cop car that trailed them here
label1 The cops know Rafferty came here
label1 They'll check the river they'll check the sewer
label1 They'll find him and come gunning for us
label1 I'll haul the bodies to the pits
label1 The cops won't check
label1 Who do you think you are giving orders
label1 You got what you wanted out of us
label1 Shut up Gail
label1 You got what you wanted out of me
label1 Gone until you brought this unholy mess on us
label1 One word from Gail and she'll cut me in half
label1 They'll be watching the roads
label1 They'll catch you
label1 It'll be the bad old days all over again
label1 The pimps the beatings the drugs the rapes
label1 Not yet they won't
label1 Get me a damn hardtop
label1 Get that gun out of my face now
label1 Ah
label1 Bastard
label1 I forgot how quick you are
label1 She almost yanks my head clean off  shoving my mouth into hers so hard it hurts
label1 An explosion that blasts away the dull gray years  between the now and that one fiery night when she was mine
label1 And make sure it's got a big trunk
label1 I'll always love you baby
label1 Just look at that trunk
label1 We'll never fit 'em all in
label1 Um unless there's something else you want me to do  you think maybe I could go home
label1 All this blood and stuffs got me feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl
label1 Sure Becky go home
label1 But don't you talk to anybody not even your mom
label1 They'll never fit in that trunk
label1 Not like this they won't
label1 Miho
label1 You'll catch cold if you don't
label1 Yeesh
label1 Hey Becky
label1 I just want to hear my mom's voice
label1 I won't tell her nothing
label1 Please don't say nothing to Gail
label1 Hey Mom
label1 We were barely able to get the trunk closed as it was  we packed it so tight
label1 There wasn't anything we could do but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me  out where anybody who cares to look will see him
label1 Go ahead take one of his cigarettes
label1 It'll help
label1 You shut the hell up Jackie Boy
label1 You're dead
label1 I'm just imagining this so shut the hell up
label1 Well it tells you something about your state of mind don't it
label1 It's got your nerves shot
label1 It's got you smoking
label1 [wheezing]  Nobody ever really quits
label1 A smoker's a smoker when the chips are down
label1 And your chips are down
label1 I'm fine
label1 You shut the hell up
label1 Will you look at that
label1 Ooh
label1 What are you gonna do when you run outta gas call AAA
label1 You sucker for the babes you
label1 You ain't even gonna make it to the pits
label1 You shut the hell up
label1 I'll make it
label1 Watch it
label1 Ah this is great
label1 Just like being in a buddy movie
label1 _ [Jackie Boy laughing]   Boy you're screwed you're out you're finished
label1 Stick a fork in it
label1 You're swirling around the bottom of the bowl  nosediving down the pipe
label1 It's over
label1 to tell him to shut up
label1 Sure he's an asshole
label1 Sure he's dead
label1 None of that stops the bastard from being absolutely right
label1 I don't have a chance in hell of outrunning this cop
label1 Not in this heap
label1 Pull over
label1 The only question left is whether I'm gonna kill him or not
label1 Tough call
label1 My hand moves all on its own  sliding one of my guns to my lap and thumbing back the hammer
label1 I don't know what to do
label1 Better stop
label1 Whatever you say
label1 I'm the designated driver
label1 Well you're driving with a busted tail light
label1 I'll let you off with a warning
label1 What next
label1 a quarter mile from the pits
label1 I shove the TBird the rest of the way
label1 Jackie Boy will go into the damn tar pits  I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks go home and call it a...  No more questions Dallas
label1 Do what I say
label1 Clear the streets
label1 We're not selling any tail in Old Town
label1 Not tonight
label1 Don't struggle
label1 You'll only hurt yourself
label1 We know everything
label1 Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty will be in our possession  and the truce between your prostitutes and the police will be shattered
label1 There'll be arrests
label1 There'll be deaths
label1 My employer will seize what remains of this neighborhood
label1 You will all be slaves
label1 Nothing can stop this
label1 Son of a bitch
label1 I have suffered your kind before the dregs of Sin City
label1 I serve a new master now  and soon you and all your wretched kind will serve him as well
label1 Now get dressed and shed a tear for Dwight McCarthy if you must  because by now he is surely dead
label1 You don't know him
label1 My man will find a way
label1 He always finds a way
label1 This is a fine grand country
label1 Guiding light of the modern world it is
label1 Low taxes land of opportunity
label1 airports and churches  without shite to show for it
label1 Yeesh
label1 You find something Murphy
label1 Looks to be a poor dead cop's badge
label1 What's this stuck in it
label1 Bloody hell
label1 You son of a bitch
label1 Bastard
label1 They were mercenaries
label1 If they were hired by who I think they were  the bad times haven't even started yet
label1 every last inch of the man Brian
label1 Ronnie
label1 Lend me your knife
label1 Should I take a nap while I'm doing all this waiting
label1 I'm at the bone all right
label1 Have you ever seen anything so pretty in your whole life
label1 We'll be back for the three of you and if anyone happens by  use your imagination OK
label1 No air to breathe
label1 Let it in
label1 Let it fill your lungs
label1 They were counting on you and you blew it
label1 Skinny steely fingers at my wrist
label1 Miho you're an angel
label1 You're a saint
label1 You're Mother Teresa
label1 You're God
label1 If you'd shown up ten minutes earlier we'd still have Jackie Boy's head
label1 It's a cinch
label1 You got yourselves a spy in Old Town
label1 A stoolie who sold you out to the mob
label1 First we gotta get Jackie Boy's head  before it gets to wherever it's going and this situation blows wide open
label1 Miho I hope to hell you left one of 'em alive enough to talk
label1 I'm not fooling around
label1 We talk
label1 Stay cool
label1 It's time to prove to your friends that you're worth a damn
label1 Sometimes that means dying
label1 Sometimes it means killing a whole lot of people
label1 There they are
label1 What do we do
label1 We stop 'em Dallas
label1 is close to me  I could almost reach out and grab it right then and there
label1 Get the head
label1 I got it
label1 I got it
label1 Suck on this you stupid slag
label1 So come down and get it
label1 I could've put a bullet straight down your ear just now  if I hadn't got me revolver all wet and useless
label1 You got the drop on me love
label1 I got to come clean with you sweetheart
label1 It was an outright lie I was giving ya about me revolver being wet
label1 You see I'm not too fond of shootin'
label1 It's my preference to blow things up
label1 Once you blast the roof off a pub  and seen all the parts flying off people  a little bang bang's never gonna match the sight of that
label1 You killed me mates
label1 Someone shoulda told ya: never give an Irishman good cause for revenge
label1 You won't feel a thing unless she wants you to
label1 She twists the blade
label1 I tell Miho what we're gonna do and how we're gonna do it
label1 I grab poor Dallas's earphone and make the most important call of my life
label1 First we gotta rescue Gail then comes the kill
label1 The big fat kill
label1 _ [gasping]  [crunching]  Do we just gotta stand here and watch this
label1 What are you kidding me man
label1 I could watch old Manute do his thing all night and not get tired of it
label1 Only an artist should be allowed to touch such a beautiful subject
label1 Your nerves responsive
label1 Beautiful
label1 Just give them what they want Gail
label1 Becky
label1 It's over Gail
label1 Dwight's dead
label1 They got what's left of that cop we killed
label1 Mob's gonna turn it over to the chief cops'll mow us down
label1 We gotta cut a deal
label1 You sold us out
label1 I didn't have no choice
label1 They was gonna hurt my mom
label1 You gotta out a deal with these people
label1 It's selfish you holding out like this
label1 You'll get a lot of girls killed for no good reason
label1 It wasn't your mom
label1 It was the money you stupid little bitch
label1 Sure you could've moved my mom into Old Town  and let her know that her daughter's a goddamn whore
label1 Breaks your heart doesn't it
label1 They offered me what you couldn't never offer me: a way out
label1 I had to watch out for my own neck
label1 Your precious scrawny little neck
label1 You're crazy
label1 You could have ripped my throat out you crazy whore
label1 Stuka kill this one
label1 No I was promised
label1 Stupid little bitch
label1 You deserve worse
label1 Hey
label1 Hey
label1 Nobody
label1 I don't see nobody
label1 Will you look at that
label1 It's right through me
label1 Guys look
label1 Some kind of note
label1 [Manute] Give it to me
label1 Guys look
label1 It's starting to hurt
label1 Out back
label1 Bring the women
label1 Do you think somebody should call me a doctor or something
label1 McCarthy you fool
label1 Hey
label1 Oh...   armed to the teeth
label1 I'm outnumbered outgunned
label1 But the alley is crooked dark and very narrow
label1 They can't surround me
label1 You can have Old Town I don't care
label1 Just give me the woman
label1 [muffled talking]  Shut up
label1 Dwight don't do this
label1 Something's not right
label1 Shut up or I'll plug you
label1 Of course Mr. McCarthy
label1 A fair trade
label1 She's all yours
label1 Exactly what I had to
label1 Every step of the way
label1 No
label1 It isn't right
label1 There wasn't no tape over his mouth
label1 How come there's tape over his mouth
label1 counts for a lot
label1 But there's nothing like having your friends show up with lots of guns
label1 McCarthy you shit
label1 The girls all know the score
label1 No escape  no surrender no mercy
label1 We gotta kill every last rat bastard one of 'em
label1 Not for revenge not because they deserve it  not because it'll make the world a better place
label1 We need a heap of bloody bodies  so when mob boss Wallenquist looks over his charts of profits and losses  he'll see what it cost him to mess with the girls of Old Town
label1 They run out back
label1 Right on schedule
label1 She gets her practice in
label1 The Valkyrie at my side is shouting and laughing  with the pure hateful bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter  and so am I

label1 I ain't got no designs on her
label1 That's damn sure good enough for me
label1 Well...  Let me see their paperwork

label1 Good
label1 Translation/timings/creator by: Deluce  so what happend to your horse
label1 He got old

label1 When the weather took a turn for the worse he  done what he could but he couldn't make it
label1 Yes it is
label1 Me an' ole lash rode a lotta' miles together
label1 Never the less..
label1 I'm gonna' miss 'em
label1 Who's Daisy domergue
label1 A no damn good murdering bitch that's who
label1 I can see you ain't got mixed emotions 'bout bringing a woman to a rope
label1 If by woman you mean her
label1 So you takin' her into red rock to hang
label1 You bet
label1 Gonna' wait to watch it
label1 I wanna' hear her neck snap with my own two ears
label1 You never wait to watch 'em hang
label1 My bounties never hang  cause I never bring 'em in alive
label1 Never ever
label1 We talked about this in chattanooga
label1 Bringing desperate men in alive is a good way to get yourself dead
label1 Can't catch me sleepin' if I don't close my eyes
label1 No one said the job was suppose to be easy
label1 No one said it was suppose to be that hard nether
label1 But that little lady  is why they call him "the hangman"
label1 But when John Ruth the hangman catches ya'  you don't die by a bullet in the back
label1 When the hangman catches you... You hang
label1 You overrate 'em nigger
label1 I'll give you he got guts
label1 But in the brains department  he like a man who took a high dive in a low well
label1 Now Daisy  I want us to work out a signal system of communication
label1 When I elbow you real hard in the face...  That means: Shut up
label1 I got it

label1 And I don't mean to unduly imply intimacy
label1 But...  Well...  You still got it
label1 I still got what
label1 Of course
label1 Do you got it on you
label1 Where
label1 Right here
label1 I can imagine you probably don't like to take  it in an'out of the envelope all that often
label1 But if you wouldn't mind  I'd sure appreciate seein' that again
label1 You right  I don't like taking it in an'out of the envelope that much
label1 Yeah
label1 But...  As your saving my life an' all  I suppose I could let you read it again
label1 "Ole Mary Todd's callin' so I guess it must be time for bed"  ole Mary Todd
label1 That gets me too
label1 You know what this is tramp
label1 It's a letter from Lincoln to him
label1 They shared a correspondence during the war
label1 They was pen pals
label1 This is just one of the letters
label1 What the...  O.B
label1 Stop
label1 Whoa easy
label1 I didn't  drag her stikin' ass up this goddamn mountain just  for you to break her neck on the ouskirts of town
label1 You the one handed her my goddamn letter
label1 I didn't give it to her I gave it to you
label1 That nigger like to bust my jaw
label1 And when he do  I'm gonna sit back on that wagon wheel watch and laugh
label1 How is it
label1 But it's alright
label1 Is that the way niggers treat their ladies
label1 You... ain't no goddamn... lady
label1 Hey mister Ruth
label1 What
label1 There's another fella' on foot up here on the road
label1 I said there's another fella' on foot up here on the road
label1 Considering there's a blizzard goin' on  whole lotta' fellas walkin' around wouldn't you say major
label1 Seems to be a lot of 'em
label1 This changes things son
label1 Eight thousand dollars a lotta' money for a nigger
label1 You really think I'm in cahoots wit' that fella'
label1 Or her
label1 Put them on
label1 I ain't wearin' handcuffs
label1 You put those on or you can stop worryin' about this whole thing right now
label1 Chapter two son of a gun  hand your weapons to the driver
label1 Little jumpy ain't you
label1 Never mind the jokes just do it
label1 I do
label1 I done did it
label1 O.B.
label1 Ya' got 'em
label1 I got 'em
label1 Okay fella'  you keep holdin' that lantern in that one hand  and you keep that other hand where I can see it
label1 I'll be a goddamn dog in the manger
label1 Is that you Chris mannix
label1 Not quite
label1 You know this fella'
label1 Only by reputation
label1 Like I said friend  you got me at a bit of a disadvantage
label1 Keepin' you at a disadvantage is a advantage I intend to keep
label1 I don't want no trouble
label1 I just wanna' ride
label1 I'm freezin to death
label1 You heard of the rebel renegade erskine mannix
label1 Mannix's marauders
label1 That's them
label1 The scourge of south Carolina mannix marauders
label1 That's erskine's youngest boy Chris
label1 What brings you in my path Chris mannix
label1 Well Mr. face  I was riding to red rock and my horse stepped in a gopher hole in the snow  fucked up his leg an' had to put 'er down
label1 Yes I do
label1 What
label1 I'm the new sheriff
label1 'Fraid not
label1 Where is your star
label1 Well I ain't the sheriff yet
label1 Once I get there they swear me in but that ain't happened yet
label1 And that's when you get your star
label1 Yeah
label1 And from the look of those three frozen fuckers up there  I figure you're a bounty hunter open for business
label1 And I figure you're taking them three dead bodies into red rock to get paid
label1 Three dead
label1 One alive
label1 Who's that
label1 Who the fuck is Daisy domergue
label1 Not a goddamn thing to nobody except me and the hangman
label1 The hangman
label1 You're the hangman Bob Ruth
label1 It's John
label1 And you..
label1 Your're the nigger with the head...  Major marquis
label1 My lord is that really the real head of major marquis lookin' at me now
label1 What's goin' on y'all havin' a bounty hunters picnic
label1 Never mind you takin' in them three dead bodies  and her to red rock to get paid ain't ya'
label1 Yeah
label1 The man is red rock suppose to pay you is me
label1 The new sherrif
label1 So if you wanna get paid you need to get me to red rock
label1 Well execuse me for findin' it hard to belive a  town electin' you to do anything except drop dead
label1 So I'm suppose to freeze death 'cause you find something hard to belive
label1 No I suppose not
label1 Put them on and come inside
label1 Then you'll freeze
label1 Then you'll hang
label1 How so
label1 Driver
label1 I gotta hold these horses I can hear you just fine from up here
label1 You heard me tell this fella' I'm the new sheriff of red rock right
label1 Yeah
label1 Red rock is my town
label1 No sir
label1 Sorry bushwackers I ain't entering red rock that way
label1 When you finally get to red rock you're going  to realize every goddamn thing I said was right
label1 And I expect you o.B.  to tell the townsfolk of red rock that John  Ruth let their new sheriff freeze to death
label1 You let me die that's murder
label1 Hold out your hands
label1 O.B
label1 One thing I know for sure  this niggerhatin' son of a gun ain't partnered up with you
label1 Now..
label1 I'll help protect your eight thousand  you help me protect my ten  deal
label1 Ain't love grand
label1 Tell ya' what Bob  the name's John
label1 When we get to red rock I'll buy you and major marquis there dinner and booze
label1 May way of sayin' thanks
label1 I don't drink  with rebel renegades and I damn sure don't break bread with 'em
label1 Well Mr. Ruth  you sound like you got a axe to grind against the cause
label1 The cause of a renegade army
label1 Ya' wrapped yourselves up in the rebel flag as an excuse to kill and steal
label1 And this should interest you Warren imparticular emancipated blacks
label1 Sounds like my kinda' fella'
label1 I was a goner and y'all saved me
label1 Shut up
label1 God damnit Daisy it's comin'
label1 Here last piece
label1 Does he know how famous you once was
label1 I don't think so
label1 Black eye
label1 Do you know who he is
label1 Yeah
label1 Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting  but they never did get 'em the right nigger head did they
label1 But it wasn't for lack of tryin'
label1 Them peckawoods left their homes and their families and come to this snowy mountain  lookin' for me and fortune
label1 None of them found fortune
label1 The ones you ain't ever heard of no more  they found me
label1 Now it didn't stay 30 thousand the length of the war
label1 But I bet even when it was five thousand  you had your share of country boys comin' to call
label1 You know I did
label1 Why did they have a reward on you
label1 The confederates took exception to my capacity for killing them
label1 After I broke out of wellenbeck  the south took my continued existence as a personal affront
label1 So the cause put a reward on my head
label1 No reb I ain't never heard of it
label1 You bust out
label1 Maj. Marquis did more than bust out
label1 Maj. Marquis had a bright idea
label1 So bright...  You got to wonder why nobody never thought about it before
label1 Tell John Ruth about your bright idea
label1 Well the whole damn place was just made out of kindling
label1 So I burnt it down
label1 Fortyseven men... Burnt to a crisp
label1 Southern youth farmer's sons   cream of the crop  and I say "let 'em burn"
label1 You joined the war to keep niggers in chains
label1 I joined the war to kill white Southern  crackers and that means kill 'em anyway I can
label1 Stab 'em
label1 Drown 'em
label1 Burn 'em
label1 Drop a big ole' rock on their head
label1 Whatever it took to put white Southern crackers in the ground  that's what I joined the war to do and that's what I did
label1 To answer your question John Ruth  when major marquis burned forty seven men alive  for no more a reason then to give a nigger a run for the trees  that's when the south put a reward on the head of major marquis
label1 And I made them trees mannix
label1 And you best belive I ain't look back till I crossed the northern line
label1 See once they started pullin' out all the burnt bodies at wellenbeck  seems not all of them boys were rebs
label1 How many burnt prisoners they end up findin'
label1 Wasn't the final yankee death count somethin' like thirtyseven
label1 That's the thing about war mannix  people die
label1 So ya' chalkin' it up to "war is hell" ha
label1 Well admittedly that's a hard argument to argue with
label1 But if memory serves  your side didn't look at it that way
label1 I belive they accused you  of being a kill crazy nigger who only joined the war to kill white folks  and the whole blue and grey of it all didn't really much matter to ya'
label1 And that's why they drummed your black ass outta'  the cavalry with a yellow stripe down your back
label1 Isn't it major
label1 Horse shit
label1 I didn't say they could prove it
label1 But they sure did think it out loud didn't they major
label1 But  Warren's war record was stellar and that's what saved his ass
label1 Are you killed yourself your share of  redskins in your day didn't ya' black major
label1 I'll tell a' what the cavalry didn't look kindly on
label1 And the fact that erskine mannix's little boy  would talk about anybody else's behavior  during war time makes me wanna horse laugh
label1 Don't you say anything about my daddy  what he fought for  was dignity in defeat and against the unconditional surrender
label1 We weren't foreign barbatians pounding on the city walls
label1 We were your brothers
label1 Just  how many nigger towns did y'all sack in your fight for dignity in defeat
label1 My faire share black major
label1 'Cuz when niggers are scared that's when white folks are safe
label1 You gonna talk that hateful nigger talk  you ride up top wtih o.B
label1 No no no you got me talkin' politics  I didn't wanna'
label1 Like I said y'all I'm just happy to be alive
label1 I..
label1 And dream about how lucky I am
label1 Chapter three minnie's haberdashery  get in there
label1 Easy
label1 What the hell's going on  we weren't expecting another stage tonight
label1 I just got through putting the horses away
label1 This ain't the normal line
label1 But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard  so it looks like you're stuck with us
label1 Are minnie and sweet Dave inside
label1 They ain't here
label1 He says they ain't here
label1 He's lookin' after the place while they gone
label1 Who are you
label1 I'm Bob
label1 Well whoever you are help o.B
label1 With the horses
label1 Get 'em outta this cold before that blizzard hit's 'em
label1 You need it done fast you need to help
label1 I got two of my best men on it
label1 You heard him freeloaders get to work
label1 Open up
label1 Kick it open
label1 Kick it open
label1 Shut that door there's a goddamn blizzard out there
label1 You gotta' nail it shut
label1 You have to nail it shut
label1 There's a hammer and nails by the door
label1 You have to nail it shut
label1 There's a hammer and nails by the door
label1 Give me a hammer
label1 Yeah
label1 You need to do two pieces of wood
label1 One ain't good enough
label1 That fuckin' thing is busted
label1 Not just one piece of wood
label1 Gimme that other piece of wood
label1 Yeah allright
label1 Here
label1 Jesus
label1 Who's the idiot who broke that that Mexican fella'
label1 Good heavens  a woman  out in this white hell
label1 You must be frozen solid poor thing
label1 Looks like minnie's got her a full house
label1 When did you fella's arrive
label1 The cowboy fella' in the courner is that your driver
label1 No he's a passenger
label1 The driver lit out
label1 He said he was going to  spend the blizzard shacked up with a friend
label1 Jesus Christ that's awful
label1 Christ almighty what that Mexican fella' do soak his ole socks in the pot
label1 He don't have that problem
label1 Where's the well water
label1 Over there
label1 So  all three of you fellas' headed to red rock when the blizzard stopped ya' huh
label1 Yes all three of us were on that stagecouch out there
label1 Coffybeans
label1 Over there
label1 The new sheriff of red rock is traveling with us
label1 Sheriff of red rock that'll be the day
label1 If he is a goddamn sheriff I'm a monkey's uncle
label1 Good
label1 So..
label1 The new sheriff of red rock is traveling with you
label1 No he's lyin'  he ain't sheriff of nothin'  he's a Southern renegade
label1 What the fuck I tell you about talkin' huh
label1 I'll bust you in the mouth right in front of these people I don't give a fuck
label1 John Ruth
label1 Are you a lawman
label1 I'm takin' her to the law
label1 You're a bounty hunter
label1 That's right Buster
label1 Do you have a warrant
label1 'Course I do
label1 Why
label1 How am I suppose to know  you're not a villain  kidnapping this woman without a warrant in your possession
label1 What's your name Buster
label1 Well..
label1 It certainly isn't Buster
label1 It's oswaldo mobray
label1 Oswaldo
label1 Well..
label1 I got my warrant oswaldo
label1 I take it you're Daisy domergue
label1 Yeah it's her
label1 It says here dead or alive
label1 Yeah it does
label1 Wouldn't transporting her be easier  if she were dead
label1 No one said the job was suppose to be easy
label1 And why is her hanging proper so important to you
label1 Let's just say I don't like to cheat the hangman
label1 Well I appreciate that
label1 Allow me to properly introduce myself
label1 I'm oswaldo mobray  the hangman in these parts
label1 Looks like I brought you a customer
label1 Have you ever spent two days or more locked up with one of your customers
label1 Don't talk to my prisoner
label1 I talk to my prisoner that's it
label1 You got it
label1 I got I got
label1 You got anything in here besides coffee that can help warm us up
label1 The bar is open follow moi
label1 All right
label1 All right
label1 Come on goddamnit I'm cold
label1 I'll feed and water the horses
label1 I've got some stew cooking
label1 Should be done soon
label1 Now look...  Now matter how bad this blizzard gets  we still gotta' feed these horses and take a squat from time to time
label1 Okay
label1 Good idea
label1 I'll give you a hand
label1 No no no go inside get warm
label1 You're doing stable work in a goddamn blizzard I offer to help and you say no
label1 You're right mi amigo
label1 All right follow me
label1 We gonna' drop one every ten paces
label1 From here to the door
label1 Yeah
label1 All right
label1 Now you're wanted for murder
label1 For the sake of my analogy let's just assume that you did it
label1 And if... You're found guilty  the people of red rock will hang you in the town square
label1 And as the hangman  I will perform the execution
label1 And if all those things end up taking place  that's what civilized society calls "justice"
label1 However  if the relatives and the loved ones of the person  you murdered were outside that door right now
label1 And after busting down that door they drug you out  in the snow and hung you up by the neck that  we would be frontier justice
label1 The bad part is it's apt to be wrong as right
label1 Not in your case
label1 But other people maybe not so much
label1 But ultimately what's the real difference between the two
label1 The real difference is me..
label1 The hangman
label1 When I hang you I  will get no satisfaction from your death
label1 It's my job
label1 The man who pulls the lever  that breaks your neck will be a dispassionate man
label1 And that dispassion is the very essence of  justice
label1 For justice delivered without dispassion  is always in danger of not being justice
label1 Amen
label1 Yeah well...  You got it
label1 What'cha writing firend
label1 Only thing I'm qualified to write about
label1 What's that
label1 My life story

label1 Was he a goner fer' sure
label1 It's a rough life but folks can learn it
label1 If he had done what he came here to do  he'd a come home
label1 Close it close it
label1 You have to hold it closed while I nail it shut
label1 Really
label1 Fucking hold it low
label1 Okay
label1 Hold it mi negro amigo
label1 Ola mi cabron
label1 There you go motherfucker
label1 That's a lotta' hats senor Bob
label1 Huh
label1 Considering minnie's no hats indoors policy
label1 Which  if I remember it correctly that was one of them bar of iron rules  kinda rule she'd want kept up in her absence
label1 I'm guilty
label1 How about we forget about the hats today  considering there's a blizzard going on and all  and make tomorrow "no hat day"
label1 A large black dog
label1 Labrador
label1 Always said that Davis was a courages man
label1 But he should have put capital in Montgomery and not Richmond
label1 Yes sir
label1 I agree with that the army in north Virginia would've been used in a..
label1 I said the army of north Virginia would have been used in very different way
label1 Shut up
label1 Do you know that nigger sir
label1 I don't know that nigger
label1 But I know he's a nigger
label1 Well that nigger just ain't any nigger
label1 That nigger is  general sanford smithers
label1 Battle of Baton Rouge
label1 Inform the nigger in the cavalry officers uniform  that I had a division of confederates under my commend  in Baton Rouge
label1 Major nigger general smithers wishes me to inform you..
label1 I heard 'em hillbilly
label1 Inform this old cracker that I was in Baton Rouge also
label1 Oh that's interesting
label1 General smithers he said that he was also in Baton Rouge
label1 On the other  cap't mannix tell the nigger  that I don't acknowledge niggers in northern uniforms
label1 But not one colored trooper made it to a camp did they
label1 We had neither the time or the food
label1 So we shot 'em where they stood
label1 Gentlemen  gentlemen  I know Americans aren't apt  to let a little thing like an unconditional surrender get in the way of a good war
label1 But I strongly suggest we don't restage the battle of Baton Rouge  during a blizzard in minnie's haberdashery
label1 Now my nubian friend  while I realize passions are high that was a while ago
label1 Once we arrive in red rock
label1 I damn will guarantee that too
label1 Yeah Warren that's the problem with old men
label1 You can kick 'em down the stairs and say it's  a accident but ya' can't just shoot 'em
label1 We divide minnie's in half
label1 The northern side and the Southern side
label1 With the dinner table  operating as a neutral territory
label1 As long aas the bar's Philadelphia I agree
label1 We still got that deal we talked about in the wagon
label1 I help you protect your eight thousand you help me protect my ten
label1 One of them fella's is not what he says he is
label1 What is he
label1 He's in cahoots with this one that's what he is
label1 One of them maybe even two of 'em is here to see domergue goes free
label1 And to accomplish that goal they'll kill everbody in here
label1 And that's when they strike  huh bitch
label1 If you say so John
label1 Are you sure you're not just being paranoid
label1 Our best bet is this  duplicitous fella' ain't as cool a customer as Daisy here
label1 But waiting for an oportunity and knowing it's the right one isn't so easy
label1 If he can't handle it he'll stop waiting
label1 He'll try and create his opportunity
label1 And that's when mr. Jumpy reveals himself
label1 And what do you got to say about all this
label1 About John Ruth's ravings
label1 He's absolutely right
label1 Me and one of them fella's is in cahoots
label1 And  we're just waitin' for everybody go to sleep
label1 That's when we gonna' kill y'all
label1 Okay everybody  hear this
label1 This here is Daisy domergue
label1 That money's mine boys
label1 Don't wanna' share it
label1 I ain't gonna' lose it
label1 When the sun comes out I'm taking this woman into red rock to hang
label1 Now...  Is there anybody here...  Comitted to stopping me'...  From doing that
label1 Nobody gotta' problem with this
label1 Well I guess that's very fortunate for me
label1 However I hope you all understand  I can't just take your word
label1 When you say precautions...  Why do I feel you mean me
label1 Because I'm gonna' take your gun son
label1 You are
label1 Yes I am
label1 Just mine
label1 The hangman got himself a gun too
label1 I'll be dealing with his gun after I deal with yours
label1 I feel kinda' naked without it
label1 Oh I still got mine
label1 I'll protect you
label1 That's right Joe gage
label1 Now gimmie the gun
label1 You have to come and take  calm down
label1 Take your hand away from your gun
label1 Blink if you're calm
label1 Did he blink
label1 He blinked
label1 Blink if your gonna' remain calm
label1 He blinked
label1 I'm real sorry about this son
label1 Like I said nothing personal
label1 Just a precaution
label1 Pretty sneaky
label1 Precautions must be taken because life is too sweet to lose
label1 Hand me that little bucket
label1 O.B.
label1 Go to the outhouse
label1 Take this bucket and dump it down the shit hole
label1 Your jacket's already on
label1 And I sorta kinda trust you
label1 After you major
label1 I'm gonna' cut you loose while we eat
label1 Don't get any ideas I ain't goin' soft on ya'
label1 You lift your ass even one inch off this seat  I'll put a bullet right in your goddamn throat
label1 So domergue  I suppose this blizzard counts as a stroke of luck as far as you're concerned
label1 You don't hear me complaining do ya'
label1 How 'bout you oswaldo
label1 How about me what
label1 Look  considerin' all the thing I done for money I ain't one to judge
label1 But don't you feel just the least little bad 'bout hangin' a woman
label1 Well hell ozzy I guess I ain't never looked at it like that before
label1 When it comes to some of them mean bastards  out therem it's the only thing does the job
label1 You really only need to hang mean bastards
label1 You goddamn son of a bitch
label1 I almost died out there
label1 You okay o.B.
label1 I'm fine
label1 I'll be fine
label1 I just need to get warm
label1 You want some stew o.B.
label1 Stew later
label1 That's nice
label1 Leave me be from your horseshit
label1 John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln letter
label1 I tole' you jackass to heehaw somewhere else
label1 That's right John
label1 You did say didn't ya'
label1 Yeah I did
label1 Yes
label1 Thee Abraham Lincoln
label1 Yes
label1 Abraham Lincoln the president of the United States..
label1 Yes
label1 Yes
label1 Wrote you a letter personally
label1 Yes
label1 Personally
label1 No
label1 Personally as in: "Dear marquis"
label1 "Dear marquis" Abraham Lincoln the president of the United States of America
label1 Yes
label1 May I see it
label1 Way John tells it   y'all hada' correspondence
label1 Yes
label1 Way John tells it y'all's practically pen pals
label1 Yes
label1 And a pen pal's..
label1 Practically a friend
label1 John Ruth  you really think a nigger drummed outta' the  calvary with a yellow stripe down his back  was practically friends with the president of the United States of America
label1 John Ruth I hate to be the one to break it to ya' but nobody in minnie's haberdashery  had ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln  least of all that nigger there
label1 Course it was
label1 You can't trust a fuckin' word that comes outta' your mouth
label1 What's the matter John Ruth
label1 I hurt your feelings
label1 As a matter of fact you did
label1 I know  I'm the only black son of a bitch you ever met so I'm gonna' cut you some slack
label1 The only time black folks are safe  is when white folks is disarmed
label1 And this letter  had the desired effect of disarming white folks
label1 Call it what you want  I call it a dirty fuckin' trick
label1 You wanna' know why I'd lie about something like that white man
label1 Well I'll tell you like the lord tole' John  a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't have that kinda' effect on me
label1 I might let a whore piss on it
label1 I spit on it
label1 Warren goddamit you leave that old man alone
label1 Stand down you son of a bitch I shared a battle field with this man
label1 Or would you deny me that too
label1 May I join you
label1 Yes you may
label1 Damn it
label1 So  how's life since the war
label1 Got both my legs
label1 I can't complain
label1 Got a woman
label1 Fever took her started this last winter
label1 What was her name
label1 Georgia girl
label1 Augusta
label1 Atlanta boy and a Augusta girl
label1 I use to raise Kentucky horses
label1 Her paw' was the owner of the breedershit where I brought of my ponies
label1 I made good deal on her
label1 Took the stake he gave and bought a bunch peach ochards
label1 Set myself up pretty well
label1 Did a hellva' lot better than my no good brothers that's for damn sure
label1 Yeah your son came up here a few years back
label1 You knew my boy
label1 Yeah...  Yeah I knew 'em
label1 Suit yourself
label1 Didja' know my son
label1 I know the day he died  do you
label1 You wanna know what day that was
label1 The day he met me
label1 He came up here to do a little nigger head huntin'
label1 By then the reward was so five thousand and bragging rights
label1 But back then to battle hard rebs five thousand just to cut off a niggers head  now that's good money
label1 So the Johnny's climbed this mountain lookin' for fortune
label1 But there was no fortune to be found
label1 All them fella's came up here sang a different tune  when they found themselves at the mercy of a nigger's gun  "let's just forget it
label1 I go my way you go yours"   that's your boy Chester talkin'  you a goddamn lie
label1 That's what they all said
label1 Beggin' for his life
label1 Your boy told me his whole life story
label1 And you was in that story general
label1 Of the bloody nigger killer of Baton Rouge..
label1 I knew me I was gonna' have some fun
label1 You shut your lyin' nigger lips up
label1 He just heard tell why you here is all
label1 It was cold the day I killed your boy
label1 And I don't mean snwoy mountain in Wyoming cold
label1 It was colder than that
label1 And on that cold day  with your boy at the business end of my gun barrel..
label1 Right down to his bare ass
label1 Then I told him to start walkin'
label1 I walked his naked ass for two hours 'fore his cold collapsed him
label1 You never even knew my boy
label1 No he didn't
label1 He's just a sneaky nigger tryin' to getcha to go for that gun
label1 But this time he wasn't begging to go home
label1 He knew he'd never see his home again
label1 And he wasn't beggin' for his life neither
label1 'Cos he knew that was long gone
label1 Now don't judge your boy too harshly general
label1 You'd be surprised what a man that cold would do for a blanket
label1 Wanna know what your boy did
label1 I took my big black pecker outta' my pants
label1 And I made him crawl through the snow on all fours over to it
label1 Then I grabbed a hand full of that black hair on the back his head...  Then I stuck my big black Johnson right down his goddamn throat
label1 And it was fulla' blood so it was warm
label1 You bet your sweet ass it was warm
label1 Starting to see pictures ain't ya'
label1 Him shakin' him cryin'  me laughin'  and him not understandin'  but you understand doncha' Sandy
label1 I never did give your boy that blanket
label1 Even after all he did and he did everything I asked
label1 No blanket
label1 That blanket was just a heart breakin' liar's promise
label1 So what you gonna' do old man
label1 You gonna' spend the next two or three days  ignore the nigger that killed your boy  ignoring how I made him suffer
label1 Ignoring how I made him...  Lick all over my Johnson
label1 The dumbest thing your boy ever did...  Was to let me know..
label1 Chapter four domergue's got a secret  about fifteen minutes has passed since we last left our characters
label1 Joe gag volunteered to take smithers dead body outside
label1 Straws we drawn to see who would help him...  O.B
label1 Lost
label1 Chris John Ruth and oswaldo  had vigorous debate about the legality of selfdefense murder they just transpired
label1 Marquis Warren who is supremely confident about the  legality of what just transpired ignored them  sat at a table by himself and drank Brandy
label1 Captain Chris mannix dawn the dead generals coat and  joined oswaldo in lighting the candles and lanterns
label1 John Ruth held the door close waiting for Joe gage and o.B
label1 To return
label1 Bob enjoyed an manzana roja
label1 Domergue however  hasn't moved from her spot at the community dinner table since John Ruth uncuffed her
label1 John Ruth...  Yeah
label1 Let's go back a bit
label1 Your boy black dudes dingus in his mouth
label1 Fifteen minutes ago major Warren shot general smithers in front of everybody
label1 But fourty seconds before that something equally  as important happened but not everybody saw it
label1 He did everything I asked no blanket
label1 And the only one to see 'em do it...  Was domergue
label1 That's why this chapter is called...  Domergue's got a secret
label1 John Ruth
label1 Yeah
label1 Yeah
label1 You come back with anything else but a guitar
label1 Domergues death march you got it
label1 Yeah yeah yeah
label1 I got it
label1 That's the one you like to sing in the stagecoach huh
label1 Yeah
label1 It's kinda' pretty
label1 Got another verse to it
label1 Go ahead sing it
label1 Gimme that guitar
label1 Turn around
label1 No no no no no
label1 Yeah yeah yeah yeah shut up
label1 When you get to hell John
label1 Tell 'em Daisy sent ya'
label1 Oh my god
label1 Gimme that fucking gun
label1 Everybody get your back sides up against that back wall over yonder
label1 Goddammit  get or don't get Joe gage
label1 It's up to you
label1 I'll get
label1 Then get
label1 Everybody turn around and put your hands on that wall
label1 Move 'em down snowshoes
label1 Everybody keep your mouth shut and do like I say
label1 You move a little sudden a little strange; You gonna' get a bullet
label1 Not a warning not a question; A bullet
label1 You got that
label1 Let me hear you say "I got it"
label1 "I got it"
label1 We have it
label1 Chris mannix come over here on this side
label1 Come on
label1 Take this gun out of my holster
label1 Point it at them
label1 Like I said anybody does anything
label1 Kill 'em
label1 I don't know 'bout all that
label1 But you ain't the killer who poisoned that coffy
label1 'Cos you almost drunk it your own damn self
label1 But one of 'em is
label1 Gimme the key
label1 Gimme the key
label1 You motherfucking black bastard
label1 You're gonna' die on this mountain and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do
label1 'Meant it didn't I
label1 And you need to understand you just killed the only  man here comitted to gettin' you to red rock alive
label1 Now one of y'all... Is workin' with her
label1 Or two of y'all is workin' with her
label1 But only one of you poisoned the coffy
label1 But John Ruth's trying to hang your woman  so you kill him... okaymaybe
label1 But o.B
label1 Wasn't hangin' nobody
label1 He damn sure would
label1 But he sure enough led over there dead now though ain't he
label1 He damn sure is you sons of bitches
label1 Just like any one of us who'd drank that coffy
label1 Now those of y'all with your hands on the wall  don't practice in poison need to think about that
label1 Think about how that coulda' you been you rollin' around on this floor
label1 And about the men standin' next ta' ya' would be responsible
label1 And I know who I got my money on
label1 Not so fast Chris
label1 We'll get there
label1 Let's slow it down
label1 Let's slow it way down
label1 He did
label1 Yeah he did didn't he
label1 But it's the stew that's got me thinking
label1 How long you say minnie been gone
label1 A week
label1 Si
label1 See my mama used to make stew
label1 And it always tasted the same no matter the meat
label1 He made stew too and like my mama's
label1 I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper  to I was a full grown man
label1 Now I ain't had minnie's stew in six months so I ain't no expert but that  damn sure is minnie's stew
label1 So if minnie's on the north side visiting her mama for a week  how'd she make the stew this morning
label1 And this
label1 This... is sweet Dave's chair
label1 When I sat in it earlier I couldn't belive it
label1 Nobody sits in sweet Dave's chaire
label1 And if... he went to the north side..
label1 What's in the chair
label1 Just what I thought
label1 Sweet Dave's goddamn blood
label1 So...  Are you actually accusing me of murder
label1 And if it's you  that means minnie and her man ain't at her mama's
label1 They're lyin' out back there dead somewhere
label1 Or if it's you britisch man  the real oswaldo mobray is lyin' in a ditch somewhere
label1 And  you're just an English fella' passin' off his papers
label1 Or we go by my theory which is the ugliest guy did it
label1 Which makes it you Joe gage
label1 So I take it you've deduced the coffy was  poisoned while you were murdering the old man
label1 Well mi negro amigo during that whole incident..
label1 I was sitting on that side of the room
label1 I didn't say you poisoned the coffy
label1 I said you didn't make the stew
label1 And both of y'all murdered minnie  and sweet Dave and whoever else picked this bad luck  day to visit minnie's haberdashery this morning
label1 And at some point y'all intented to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy
label1 But you didn't count on the blizzard and you didn't count on the two of us
label1 That's as far as I got
label1 How am I doin'
label1 So do you intend to murder me based on a far fetched nigger theory
label1 Or can you prove it cabrone
label1 It ain't so far fetched senior Bob
label1 And it's a little bit more then my theory
label1 Four months
label1 If you would have been here two and half years ago  you'd know about the sign usta' hang above the bar
label1 Minnie mentioned that to you
label1 You know what that sign said senior Bob
label1 "No dogs or Mexicans allowed"  minnie hung that sign up the day she opened this habadashery
label1 And it hung over that bar every day till she  took down a little over two years ago
label1 You know why she took it down
label1 She started lettin' in dogs
label1 So when you tell me minnie went to north side to visit her mama
label1 Well I find that highly unlikely... but okay  maybe
label1 But when you tell me minnie mink took the habadashery  the most precious thing to her in the whole world  and left it in hands of a goddamn Mexican
label1 Well that's what I meant in the barn when I said: "That sure don't sound like minnie"
label1 And if you lyin which you are  then you killed minnie  and sweet Dave
label1 Four measly bulltes and there goes senior Bob
label1 That still don't get us no closer...  To which one of y'all poisoned the coffy though
label1 No it sure don't
label1 Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy to free Daisy
label1 If I don't hear a confession from one of you  motherfuckers quick fast and in a hurry  I'm gonna' pull this whole pot of coffy down that bitches goddamn throat
label1 Okay time's up
label1 Stop
label1 Alright I did it it was me I poisoned the coffy
label1 You gonna' die now you murderin' bastard
label1 Major Warren please let me sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell
label1 He's worth ten of you
label1 Warren can I kill him
label1 Say adios to your huevos
label1 Major Warren

label1 Can't be too strong on this mountain thank you
label1 Well what'd ya' think
label1 He adds something not much but something
label1 What do you think Pete
label1 Well I must admit he does make the set up more convincing
label1 Do we collect the bodies and Chuck 'em in the well out there
label1 And then start unhitching the horses and get 'em in the barn and get 'em fed
label1 Well hang on by puttin the horses away that's easy enough
label1 Look I just started working here
label1 Whatever minnie to make y'all mad
label1 I had nothing to do with it
label1 Well old man  if you was a cat what just happened here  would count as one of your nine lives
label1 Yes

label1 I expect no less
label1 Not so fast old man
label1 You might have a way out of this yet
label1 Later today  dirty son of a gun's gonna come in here
label1 And he's gonna have my sister with him  and he's gonna have her in chains
label1 You know why
label1 No

label1 Better now I see your ugly face
label1 How you like you that
label1 You bushwhacker castrator
label1 What are you doin' he was giving up
label1 I'm sorry honey
label1 May I sit in the chair
label1 Yes you may
label1 Keep your hands flat on that table
label1 And don't move 'em
label1 Mannix
label1 You sure picked the wrong time to turn into a nigger lover
label1 You're about to be murdered in some nigger named  minnie's house and you don't even know why
label1 Okay bitch..
label1 I am workin with all three of them fella's..
label1 But not cause they got butterflies in their belly 'bout me
label1 But because we're all gang members the Jody domergue gang
label1 That fella' y'all just killed in the basement was Jody domergue my brother
label1 You wanna tell 'em bounty man
label1 He's a big bad cat
label1 He's worth fifty thousand dollars
label1 And every member of his gang is wort at least ten
label1 Wich finally explains why you're worth ten
label1 And what's gonna' happen when that sun comes  out nigger so is my brother's fifteen men  comin' straight here for us
label1 Tell 'em grouch
label1 If we couldn't kill John Ruth and free Daisy here
label1 Their job was to sack the town kill John Ruth and free Daisy there
label1 Oh yeah
label1 And Chris I'm tellin' you you ain't done anything yet we can't forgive
label1 So...   Let's make a deal
label1 You gonna' let that nigger speak for you Chris
label1 Hold it Warren
label1 Seein' as she ain't got nothin' to sell I'm  kinda curious about her sales pitch humor me
label1 What's... your... deal
label1 Easy
label1 Take your gun shoot that nigger dead
label1 Then we sit here all nice like for the next two days
label1 When the snow melts...  We go back to Mexico and you go on to red rock to get that star pinned on your chest
label1 Well... we can give 'em Marco
label1 He's worth twelve thousand dollars
label1 That's "Marco the Mexican"
label1 Sheeit after I blew his face off Marco ain't worth a peso
label1 If I die in the next two days which is more than likely you can have me
label1 Under the name "English Pete hicox" I've gotta' federal  bounty of fifteen thousand dollars on my head
label1 And it's all your Chris
label1 You keep talkin' Pete
label1 Joe gage who you be
label1 Grouch douglass
label1 You heard of him
label1 Yeah I heard of grouch douglass
label1 He's worth ten just like Daisy
label1 Oh you can kill us all
label1 But you'll never spend a cent of that bounty money  and you'll never leave this mountain alive
label1 Because when that snow melts the rest of Jody's  gang  all fifteen of 'em that were waiting  in red rock are comin' here
label1 If you really want all that domergue gang bounty money  you still got to get all our corpses into red rock
label1 And that ain't gonna' be so easy
label1 Cause I doubt you can drive a four horse team
label1 And that wagon out there is too heavy for a two horse team
label1 So that means you're gonna' hafta' lead a string of horses into red rock  and with that deep snow after a blizzard  you ain't gonna' be able to get away with any more then let's say one body per horse
label1 So that's you leading a string of four horses into red rock  and with all them horses in that snow  and you all by your lonesome you're gonna be a mite poky
label1 And you gonna' run smack dab into the domergue  gang and agin grouch how many is that
label1 And when those fifteen killers  come across you  in possession of all of our dead bodies they  ain't just gonna' kill you and that nigger
label1 There gonna go back to red rock and kill every son of a bitch in that town
label1 You wanna save the town
label1 Then shoot that nigger dead
label1 You belive in Jesus now huh bitch
label1 Well good 'cos 'bout meet him
label1 Anybody else wanna' make a deal huh
label1 The deal still stands Chris
label1 It's still all on that nigger
label1 Shoot 'em dead take my body  and sit out the snow with Daisy and grou  mannix
label1 Catch 'em here
label1 Catch 'em here
label1 Yeah
label1 And I get oswaldo and Joe gage
label1 Yeah
label1 But Jody's worth fifty thousand what 'bout his body
label1 You gonna make a deal with this diabolical bitch
label1 I'm not sayin' I'm gonna' make a deal with her we're just talkin'
label1 So what about Jody's body and the fifty thousand
label1 You've gotten greedy reb no deal
label1 We take Jody's body back with us he got children
label1 So I kill Warren... And we're all friends
label1 No deal tramp
label1 Chris you're makin' the biggest mistake of your life
label1 When our boys get here in a coupla' days their gonna cut your nuts off
label1 And there won't be a stick left in that town unburnt
label1 Well I guess I should be plum scared right now huh
label1 If you had any brains you would be
label1 Here's the problem Daisy
label1 In order for me to be scared of your threats  I got to believe in those fifteen extra gang members waitin' it out in red rock
label1 And boy oh boy..
label1 I sure don't
label1 And you watched me pork up and didn't say shit...  And I believe...  You all what you've always been...  A lyin' bitch who will do anything...  To cheat that rope waitin' for her in red rock
label1 Including shittin' out fifteen extra gang members  whenever you needs be
label1 And..
label1 I'm lookin' at 'em right here right right  now
label1 Goddamn right
label1 You're gonna' die on this mountain Chris
label1 My brother leds an army of men  horse shit
label1 My daddy led an army he led a renegade amry fightin' a lost cause
label1 Your brother's just a owl hoot who led a gang of killers
label1 I don't feel so good
label1 Oh shit
label1 You still alive white boy
label1 Mannix
label1 Fuck
label1 Hey boy
label1 Chris mannix
label1 Wake the fuck up
label1 Wake up white boy
label1 I ain't dead yet you black bastard
label1 Chris mannix I may have misjudged you
label1 No no no don't shoot her
label1 Why the hell not
label1 John Ruth
label1 John Ruth was one mighty mighty bastard
label1 What's the Las thing...  That bastard did 'fore he died
label1 Was save your life
label1 We gonna' die white boy
label1 But there's one thing left we do have a say in
label1 And I say shootin's to good for her...  John Ruth coulda shot her anywhere anytime along the way  but John Ruth was the hangman...  And when the hangman catches ya' you don't die by no bullet
label1 When the the hangman catches ya'...  You hang

label2 Hey, Frank
label2 It's gonna be 40 below in five minutes
label2 All right, all right
label2 Let's get it going
label2 Keep it together
label2 Come on
label2 Right
label2 Here we go, Mr. Dillon
label2 Give us strength, O Lord, to endure
label2 We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry God
label2 Amen
label2 [ All ] Amen
label2 Thank you, gentlemen
label2 Here are the facts
label2 As some of you know,  a 337 model E.E.V....  crashlanded here at 0600...  on the morning watch
label2 There was one survivor,  two dead and a droid that was hopelessly smashed beyond repair
label2 I just want to say that I've taken a vow of celibacy
label2 That also includes women
label2 Yes
label2 We've all taken the vow!  
label2 I'd like to say that I, for one,  do not appreciate company policy allowing her to freely...  intermingle with inmates and the rest of the staff
label2 What brother means to say is we view the presence of any outsider,  especially a woman, as a violation of the harmony,  a potential break in the spiritual unity
label2 We are well aware of your feelings in this matter
label2 Hopefully, they will be here inside of a week  Oh, come on
label2 What's her medical status
label2 She doesn't seem too badly damaged
label2 She's unconscious
label2 Can't give you a more specific diagnosis at the moment
label2 Will she live
label2 Look
label2 It's in everybody's interest...  the woman doesn't come out of the infirmary until the rescue team arrives
label2 And certainly not without an escort, right
label2 Sir
label2 Gentlemen, we should all stick to our set routine...  and not get unduly agitated
label2 Right
label2 All right
label2 Thank you, gentlemen
label2 All right
label2 What's that
label2 It's just a little cocktail of my own mix
label2 You a doctor
label2 My name is Clemens
label2 I'm the chief medical officer here
label2 Here
label2 Fury 161
label2 Do you mind
label2 This is basically a stabilizer
label2 I really ought to shave your head
label2 We have a big problem with lice here
label2 And when you're feeling better, I'll give you some clippers,  and you can tend to your private parts yourself
label2 How'd I get here
label2 Evidently separated from your mother ship before you hit our atmosphere
label2 You have any idea how long you were in hypersleep
label2 'Cause coming out the way you did can be quite a jolt to the system
label2 Yeah, I'll be sick for a couple of weeks
label2 Indeed
label2 What
label2 They didn't survive
label2 I have to get to the ship
label2 Have to get to the ship
label2 You're in no condition for that
label2 You want to get me some clothes, or should I just go like this
label2 Given the nature of our indigenous population, I would suggest clothes
label2 [ Clears Throat ]  None of them have seen a woman in years
label2 Why
label2 Keep the pilot light on
label2 The pilot light for what
label2 Blast furnace
label2 Natural methane
label2 We have a foundry, Lieutenant Ripley
label2 How do you know my name
label2 It's stenciled on the back of your shorts
label2 Where are the bodies
label2 We have a morgue
label2 We put them there until the investigative team arrives in about a week, I think
label2 Disconnected
label2 We put what was left on the rubbish tip
label2 The corporal was impaled by that safety support
label2 He never knew what hit him
label2 And the girl
label2 She drowned in her cryotube
label2 I don't think she was conscious when it happened
label2 Where is she
label2 In the morgue
label2 I have to see her
label2 I have to see what's left of her
label2 Is there any particular reason that you're so insistent
label2 Yes
label2 I hate to be repetitious about such a sensitive subject,  but it is persectly clear that she drowned
label2 No
label2 She wasn't
label2 Um  CCould I have a moment alone, please
label2 Yes, of course
label2 What's she doing
label2 Okay
label2 We have to do an autopsy
label2 What
label2 And I told you, she drowned
label2 I'm not so sure
label2 II have to see inside of her
label2 You're disorientated
label2 Half your system's still in  I have a very, very good reason
label2 Possible contagion
label2 What kind exactly
label2 Cholera
label2 Cholera
label2 There hasn't been a case of cholera reported for 200 years
label2 Everything's in place
label2 No indication of disease
label2 Chest
label2 Open the chest
label2 Careful
label2 Flooded with fluid
label2 Ergo, she drowned
label2 Now, since I'm not a complete idiot,  would you like to tell me what we're really looking for
label2 Mr. Clemens
label2 Superintendent
label2 What's going on, Mr. Clemens
label2 That's right, sir
label2 What's going on, Mr. Clemens
label2 Second, in the interest of public health,  I am performing an autopsy
label2 Without my authority
label2 Well, there didn't seem to be time
label2 But it's turned out all right
label2 There's no sign of contagion in the body
label2 But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley didn't parade around in front of the prisoners,  as I am told she did in the last hour
label2 It might also be helpful...  if you kept me informed as to any change in her physical status
label2 Or would that be asking too much
label2 Nonsense
label2 We'll keep the bodies on ice till the rescue team arrives
label2 On ice
label2 There is the public health issue
label2 The lieutenant feels that there is still a possibility of a communicable infection
label2 It would appear that the child drowned
label2 But without the benefit of proper laboratory tests,  it's impossible to be absolutely certain
label2 I would consider it unwise...  to tolerate even the possibility of an unwelcome virus
label2 Would it not, sir
label2 We've 25 prisoners in this facility
label2 All doubleychromos
label2 All thieves, rapists, murderers, child molesters
label2 All scum
label2 Just because they've taken on religion doesn't make them any less dangerous
label2 I don't want to upset the order
label2 I don't want ripples in the water
label2 And I don't want a woman walking around giving them ideas
label2 I see
label2 Exactly
label2 I will leave the details of the cremation to you, Mr. Clemens
label2 They may use the furnace, but I want everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours
label2 You called it, sir
label2 What do you mean
label2 Any dead ox is a good ox
label2 You're bloody right
label2 There's only seven of the friggin' things left, and then we're done with them
label2 God, I hates hosin' these bastards down
label2 I always get shite all over me boots
label2 Talkin' of hosing things down, FrankYeah
label2 You had the chance, what would you say to her
label2 You know
label2 If you got the chance
label2 You mean, casual like
label2 Yeah
label2 I mean, how would you put it to her if you bumped into her in the mess hall or somewhere
label2 No problem
label2 I'd say to her, "Good day, my dear
label2 How's it goin'
label2 Then I'd give her the look, you knowup and down
label2 [ Grunts ]  And I'd give her the wink, the dirty smile
label2 She'd soon get the picture
label2 Yeah, right
label2 And then she'd say, "Kiss my ass, you horny old fucker!
label2 I'd be happy to kiss her anywhere she wants
label2 Yeah, but treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen
label2 Right, Frank
label2 Told you before, Murph
label2 Treat a queen like a whore and a whore like a queen
label2 What do you think killed Babe
label2 Beats me
label2 She just keeled over
label2 The charts say 1 1
label2 In her prime
label2 Never mind
label2 We'll chop her up later and throw her in the stew
label2 Hey, Frank
label2 What's this
label2 "We commit this child...  "and this man to your keeping, O Lord
label2 "They have been released...  from all darkness and pain.
label2 "The child and the man...  "have gone beyond our world
label2 "They are forever eternal...  "and everlasting
label2 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
label2 Why are the innocent punished
label2 Why the sacrifice
label2 Nothing's certain
label2 Only that some get called, some get saved
label2 She won't ever know the hardship and grief...  for those of us left behind
label2 We commit these bodies to the void...  with a glad heart
label2 For within each seed,  there is a promise of a flower
label2 [ Gurgling ]  And within each death,  no matter how small,  there's always a new life
label2 A new beginning
label2 Amen
label2 The only one to survive that crash is a woman
label2 What trouble can she cause
label2 What the fuck are we supposed to do  I, for one  I mean it
label2 Okay
label2 There's a lot of talk going around that we've got some disharmony here
label2 Any you guys want to tell me what the problem is
label2 Speak to me, brothers
label2 All right
label2 I don't mind the dark
label2 I don't mind the bugs
label2 I don't mind wanderin' around in some cold, wet, damp tunnel for a week at a time
label2 I don't mind anything
label2 But I mind Golic
label2 That the way you feel about it
label2 The guy's crazy and he smells bad
label2 [ Snickering ]  I ain't going out with him anymore
label2 You got anything to say for yourself
label2 Golic is just another poor, miserable, suffering son of a bitch, just like you and me
label2 'Cept he smells worse
label2 And he's crazy
label2 Knock off the shit
label2 You got a job to do
label2 I don't want to hear another word about Golic
label2 Okay
label2 As I thought
label2 I just wanted to, uh, say thanks for what you said at the funeral
label2 It was, uh  My friends would have appreciated it
label2 Yeah, well, you don't wanna know me, lady
label2 I'm a murderer and rapist of women
label2 Really
label2 Well, I guess I must make you nervous
label2 Do you have any faith, sister
label2 Well, we've got a lot of faith here
label2 I thought women weren't allowed
label2 Well, we've never had any before,  but we tolerate anybody
label2 Even the intolerable
label2 Thank you
label2 Nothing personal
label2 You see, we've got a good place to wait here
label2 And until now, no temptation
label2 What are you waiting for
label2 Huh
label2 We're waiting for God to return...  and raise his servants to redemption
label2 of the alternative people...  embraced religion, as it were, about five years ago
label2 [ Ripley ] I'm on medication
label2 Hardly
label2 Some sort of apocalyptic, millenarian, Christian fundamentalist, uh  Right
label2 Exactly
label2 Point is, when the company wanted to close the facility down,  Dillon and the rest of the converts wanted to stay
label2 And they were allowed to remain as custodians...  with two minders...  and a medical officer
label2 And here we are
label2 How did you get this wonderful assignment
label2 It's okay
label2 Now that I've gone out on a limb for you with Andrews,  damaged my already lessthanperfect relationship with that good man,  and briefed you...  on the humdrum history of Fury 1 61,  can you not tell me what you were looking for in the girl
label2 Ln what way
label2 Ln that way
label2 Very direct
label2 So have I.  â™ª In the year 751 0 â™ª  â™ª If God's acomin' â™ª  â™ª He oughta make it by then â™ª  â™ª Maybe he'll look around and say â™ª  â™ª Guess it's time for the Judgmentâ™ª  Yech
label2 â™ª In the year â™ª â™ª  Hey, Spike
label2 Spike
label2 Are you down there
label2 What are you doing
label2 I really appreciate your affections,  but I am aware that they... deflected my question
label2 In the nicest possible way, of course
label2 You're spoiling the mood
label2 I have a job to do
label2 And now that I'm in your cot,  you think I owe you an answer
label2 I think you owe me an answer
label2 Being in my bed's got nothing to do with it
label2 I had a terrible dream in hypersleep
label2 And I had to be sure what killed her
label2 Anyway, I made a mistake
label2 made another mistake
label2 What's that
label2 Fraternizing with a prisoner
label2 Physical contact
label2 It's against the rules, isn't it
label2 Definitely
label2 When was this
label2 L think you know
label2 You have a bar code on the back of your head
label2 That does deserve an explanation
label2 But I don't think now is the moment
label2 Sorry
label2 On Intercom ] Mr. Clemens
label2 Mr. Aaron
label2 Superintendent Andrews would like you to report...  to vent shaft 22 on the second quadrantnow
label2 Something serious
label2 You could call it that
label2 Sorry
label2 I have to go
label2 Official duties
label2 Murphy
label2 How do you know
label2 That's his boot
label2 I gave him the assignment, sir
label2 No apologies, Mr. Aaron
label2 It wasn't your fault
label2 Well, not much to say, is there
label2 Death was instantaneous
label2 No shit
label2 Sudden rush of air, I'd imagine, except  Right
label2 Almost happened to me once
label2 I've told him so many times, "Stay away from the fans.
label2 Nobody bloody listens
label2 What's that
label2 I don't know
label2 I want to see you in my quarters in 30 minutes, if you'll please, Mr. Clemens
label2 Have you got any ideas
label2 Here you are
label2 You know, wandering around without an escort...  is really gonna piss Superintendent Andrews off
label2 Will you tell me about your accident
label2 Really
label2 How
label2 Hmm
label2 In the air shaft
label2 I found something at the accident site,  just a bit away from where it happened
label2 A mark
label2 A burn
label2 Rather like the one you found on the girl's cryotube
label2 I'm on your side
label2 I want to help, but I need to know what's going on...  or what you think is going on
label2 Lf you really wanna help,  find me a computer with audio capabilities...  so I can access this flight recorder
label2 We don't have anything like that here
label2 The droid that crashed with me
label2 I can point you in the right direction
label2 I can't join you
label2 This'll top you up
label2 Golic, don't fidget
label2 What's all this shit
label2 What the hell does he ever do right
label2 Eat
label2 He's got that down pretty good
label2 You light a candle for Murphy
label2 I'll light a thousand
label2 Never complained about me once
label2 Is it true what they say
label2 His head split into a million pieces
label2 Sit down, Mr. Clemens
label2 Thank you
label2 Sugar
label2 Milk
label2 Just a little, please
label2 Thank you, Mr. Aaron
label2 Listen to me, you piece of shit
label2 You screw with me one more time, I'll cut you in half
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I don't think I understand
label2 They want this woman looked after
label2 They consider her to be very high priority
label2 Why
label2 L have no idea
label2 This accident with Murphy is what happens...  when one of these dumb sons of a bitches walks around with a hardon
label2 I'm a doctor
label2 You're the jailer
label2 We both know exactly what you are
label2 Sit down
label2 I think it might be better if I left
label2 You do
label2 Isn't that lovely
label2 Consider this, Mr. Clemens
label2 How would you like me to explain your sordid history...  to your newfound friend
label2 For her personal edification, of course
label2 I don't like you
label2 Insolent
label2 Possibly dangerous
label2 You question everything
label2 If I didn't need a medical officer,  I wouldn't let you within light years of this operation
label2 I'm eternally grateful
label2 Keep your sarcasms to yourself
label2 About what
label2 About the woman
label2 Don't play with me, Mr. Clemens
label2 You spend every second you can with her
label2 And I have my suspicions not all of your concerns with her are medical
label2 What the hell she was doing in an E.E.V.
label2 She told me she was part of a combat unit that came to grief
label2 Beyond that, I assume it's all classified
label2 I haven't pressed her for more
label2 That's all
label2 You're sure
label2 Yes
label2 No
label2 Get out of here
label2 [ Screams ]  Shut up, you fuckin' bitch
label2 Get in there
label2 Nobody's gonna hear you
label2 Goddamn it, let go of me
label2 Fuck you
label2 No
label2 Hold still
label2 Shh
label2 No
label2 Goddamn it
label2 You okay
label2 No
label2 Take off
label2 I gotta reeducate some of the brothers
label2 We've gotta discuss some matters of the spirit
label2 So let's do it
label2 This is like 1 0 city blocks
label2 How many
label2 Can't you chew a little quieter
label2 I'm trying to figure out how big this compartment is
label2 I can't think with all this goddamn noise you're making
label2 You're not supposed to swear
label2 Now, we've encircled this entire compartment once  Hey
label2 What
label2 What the shit is doing that
label2 Swearing
label2 Shut up
label2 It's all right to say "shit.
label2 What the hell is going on with the candles
label2 Backwash from the closest circulating unit
label2 But if all the candles go out, how the hell we gonna know where we are
label2 Somebody will just have to go back and relight them
label2 I guess I'm nominated
label2 Watch your step, brother
label2 Okay, who are the comedians
label2 Quick, grab it
label2 Help me
label2 Help me
label2 Go
label2 Fuckin' go
label2 Quick
label2 Run
label2 Gimme that
label2 Get this fucking thing off me
label2 Oh, fuck
label2 Let me go
label2 Ah, Ripley
label2 How you feeling
label2 My legs hurt
label2 Uh, listen, I'm sorry
label2 It's okay
label2 How are you
label2 I like your new haircut
label2 No problem
label2 Golic
label2 I'm home
label2 Why were our cryotubes ejected
label2 Stasis interrupted
label2 Fire in cryogenic compartment
label2 Repeat
label2 What started the fire, Bishop
label2 Can you hear me
label2 The fire was electrical
label2 Lt was in the subflooring
label2 Did the sensors pick up anything moving around on the ship prior to separation
label2 It's very dark here, Ripley
label2 I'm not what I used to be
label2 Just tell me
label2 Was there an alien on board
label2 Yes
label2 Is it on the Sulaco or did it come with us on the E.E.V.
label2 Does the company know
label2 It all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network
label2 And they want it
label2 I hurt
label2 Do me a favor
label2 Disconnect me
label2 I could be reworked, but I'll never be top of the line again
label2 I'd rather be nothing
label2 You're sure
label2 It wasn't me
label2 I didn't do it
label2 It wasIt was the dragon
label2 Feeds on minds
label2 What about Boggs and Rains
label2 It wasn't me
label2 It wasn't me
label2 Stark raving mad
label2 I'm not saying it was anyone's fault, but he should have been chained up
label2 You called it, sir
label2 Mad as a fucking hatter
label2 Keep him separated from the rest
label2 Clemens, sedate this poor idiot
label2 Yeah
label2 Not until we know about the brothers
label2 Pull yourself together
label2 Talk to me now
label2 Now, where are Boggs and Rains
label2 gonna get anything out of him
label2 It wasn't me
label2 We'll have to send out a search team
label2 I'm afraid we'll have to assume there's a very good chance...  this simple bastard has murdered them
label2 Now, you don't know that
label2 He's crazy, he's a fool, but he's not a liar
label2 He's telling the truth
label2 I'd like to talk to him about thisthis dragon
label2 [ Andrews ] You're not talking to anyone, Lieutenant
label2 I'm not interested in your opinion,  because you are not in full possession of the facts
label2 Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon
label2 Yeah
label2 That part's right
label2 Then I'll talk to you
label2 When I have finished with my official duties,  I will be quite pleased to have a little chat, yes
label2 Let me see if I have this correct, Lieutenant
label2 It's an eightfoot creature of some kind,  with acid for blood, and it arrived on your spaceship
label2 It kills on sight and is generally unpleasant
label2 And, of course, you expect me to accept all this on your word
label2 No, I don't expect anything
label2 Quite a story, Mr. Aaron
label2 Right, sir
label2 Never heard anything quite like it, sir
label2 Expect not
label2 Tell me, Lieutenant, what would you suggest we do
label2 Well, what kind of weapons have you got
label2 What keeps them from killing you
label2 Fear
label2 There's no way to escape
label2 With the arrival of the next supply ship, the company would eliminate them
label2 This is a maximum security prison,  and you have no weapons of any kind
label2 We have some carving knives in the abattoir
label2 A few more in the mess hall
label2 Some fire axes scattered about the place
label2 That's all
label2 We're on the honor system
label2 Then we're fucked
label2 No, you're fucked
label2 Quarantined
label2 Mr. Aaron will escort you
label2 I think you'll be safe from any large, nasty beast while you're there, right
label2 Yes, that's a good girl
label2 Superintendent Andrews wants a meeting
label2 Isn't there any way off of this place
label2 Some way to escape
label2 No
label2 Supply ship comes every six months
label2 Mmhmm
label2 Fuck
label2 They are sending somebody to pick you up quite soon, I gather
label2 Really
label2 [ Coughs ] What's "soon"
label2 I don't know
label2 Nobody's ever been in a hurry to get here before
label2 You'll just say I'm crazy
label2 That's a bit uncharitable
label2 [ Inhales, Coughing ]  How are you feeling
label2 Sore throat
label2 Pissed off
label2 Well, that's understandable given the circumstances
label2 Perhaps I should give you one of my special cocktails
label2 blames everybody for everything
label2 Nobody's persect, only human
label2 There's no such thing as a perfect human
label2 That's very profound, Golic
label2 Thank you
label2 You married
label2 Me
label2 You should get married, have kids
label2 Pretty girl
label2 They used to like me
label2 For a while
label2 You're gonna die too
label2 What
label2 Just curious
label2 No
label2 How about leveling with me
label2 Could you be more specific
label2 When I asked how you got assigned here, you avoided the question
label2 And then when I asked about the prison I.D
label2 tattooed on the back of your head,  you ducked me again
label2 Lt's a long, sad story...  and more than a little melodramatic
label2 If you insist
label2 After my student years,  despite the fact that I had become...  secretly addicted to morphine,  I was considered to be most promising,  a man with a future
label2 So, I went out and I got more than a little drunk
label2 Then I got called back
label2 Boiler had blown on a fuel plant,  and there were 30 casualties
label2 And 1 1 of them died
label2 Not as a result of the accident...  but because I prescribed the wrong dosage of painkiller
label2 At least I got off the morphine
label2 L'm sorry
label2 L think I was let off lightly
label2 Did you serve your time here
label2 So when they stayed, I stayed
label2 Nobody else would employ me
label2 Magnificent
label2 Give us strength, O Lord, to endure
label2 We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry God
label2 Let the circle be unbroken until the day
label2 Amen
label2 What the fuck is this bullshit that's comin' down
label2 We got murder
label2 We got brothers in trouble
label2 I don't want no more bullshit around here
label2 Now, we got problems, we stand together
label2 Yes
label2 Thank you, Mr. Dillon
label2 All right
label2 Here are the facts
label2 At 0800 hours, prisoner Murphy,  through carelessness on his part,  was found dead in vent shaft 1 7
label2 He seems to have been sucked into a ventilator fan
label2 At about 21 00 hours,  prisoner Golic reappeared in a deranged state
label2 There seems to be a good chance that they have met with foul play...  at the hands of prisoner Golic
label2 We need to organize and send out a search party
label2 Volunteers will be appreciated
label2 I think it's fair to say that our smoothly running facility...  has suddenly developed a few problems
label2 Lt's here
label2 It got Clemens
label2 Stop this raving at once
label2 I'm telling you, it's here
label2 Aaron, get that foolish woman back to the infirmary
label2 [ Screams ]  [ All Shouting ]   Out of my way
label2 Fuck
label2 Your wrath has come, and the time is near for us to be judged
label2 The apocalypse is upon us
label2 Let us be ready
label2 Let your mercy be just
label2 It was massive
label2 Amen
label2 L was there
label2 I saw it
label2 What the fuck do we do now
label2 Organize
label2 We gotta organize, right
label2 Well, I guess I'm next in line
label2 85's gonna be in charge
label2 Jesus, give us a break
label2 Don't call me that
label2 no way I can replace Andrews
label2 I know you guys didn't appreciate him
label2 Aaron, we don't want to hear that shit now
label2 Hey, sister, what about you
label2 You're an officer
label2 How about showing us a little leadership
label2 Forget fucking Shirley Temple
label2 Right
label2 You run things here anyway
label2 No fuckin' way
label2 I'm not the officer type
label2 Well, what does this fucking beast want
label2 Is this mother gonna try for us all
label2 Well, ain't that sweet
label2 So how are we gonna stop it
label2 [ Clears Throat ]   We have no weapons
label2 Is that correct
label2 Right
label2 I haven't seen one exactly like this before
label2 But the others were afraid of fire  not much else
label2 Can we seal off this area
label2 No chance
label2 The installation's 1 0 miles square
label2 There's 600 air ducts running to the surface
label2 I see these closedcircuit monitors everywhere
label2 We could try to find it that way
label2 The video system hasn't worked in years
label2 We got a lot of technology, no way to fix it
label2 What 85 is trying to tell you is  Don't call me that
label2 We ain't got no entertainment center, no climate control,  no video system, no surveillance,  no freezers, no fucking ice cream,  no rubbers, no women, no guns
label2 All we got here is shit
label2 Oh, what the hell are we even talking to her for
label2 Why don't we just get her head and shove it through the fucking wall
label2 That sounds good to me
label2 Why don't you shut the fuck up
label2 Right
label2 What are we going to do
label2 What's this
label2 Um,  that leads from the mess hall to the infirmary
label2 It's a ventilation shaft
label2 Hey
label2 Hey, look, there's miles and miles of tunnel through there
label2 It won't go far
label2 It'll nest in this area
label2 Right around...  here
label2 How do you know that
label2 It's like a lion
label2 It sticks close to the zebras
label2 Oh, right
label2 Running around down here in the darkAre you kidding
label2 Once you get out of this main shaft, there's no overheads
label2 Don't we have flashlights
label2 We got thousands of 'em, but no batteries
label2 Torches
label2 Do we have the capacity to make fire
label2 Most humans have enjoyed that privilege since the Stone Age
label2 No need to be sarcastic
label2 Never been used
label2 They were gonna dump a lot of nuclear crap in there
label2 It's clean as a whistle inside
label2 This the only way in or out
label2 That's right
label2 Walls are six feet thick, solid steel
label2 You're saying we get something in there,  there's no way it can get out
label2 That's right
label2 No fucking way
label2 This is where we keep it
label2 Quinitricetyline
label2 L knew that
label2 I've got to get these section arrangements organized with Dillon...  for the paintbrush, uh  So, um David
label2 Yeah
label2 You can get these drums organized
label2 And, uh, don't call me that
label2 What's this "85" thing
label2 Couple of us sneaked a look at his personnel file the day he arrived
label2 Lt's his I.Q
label2 I saw a drum of this stuff...  fall into a beachhead bunker once
label2 The blast put a tug in dry dock for 1 7 weeks
label2 Great stuff
label2 Let me get this straight
label2 You want to burn it down and out of the pipes,  force it in here, slam the door...  and trap its ass
label2 Right
label2 You got something better to do
label2 Why should we put our ass on the line for you
label2 Your ass is already on the line
label2 The only question is...  what are you gonna do about it
label2 There's only one of these fucking batteries in 2,000 that works
label2 Hey, it could have been a lot worse
label2 Yeah
label2 We might have got the paintbrush detail
label2 This shit smells awful
label2 Then don't breathe the fucking fumes
label2 I'm in a fucking pipe with it
label2 I mean, don't breathe too hard
label2 You'll get high
label2 That's good for me
label2 So you miss Doc, right
label2 I thought you two got real close
label2 I guess you've been looking through some keyholes
label2 That's what I thought
label2 Oh
label2 You okay
label2 Yeah
label2 l'm fine
label2 L'm fine
label2 I hate this place
label2 I hate this place
label2 Well
label2 Okay
label2 Don't light the fire until I give the signal
label2 Got it
label2 Can you remember that
label2 Buh  Wait for the fucking signal
label2 Aaah
label2 Come on, come on
label2 We gotta find the sprinklers
label2 Come on
label2 We gotta help these guys
label2 Move
label2 Move
label2 Go to the waste dump
label2 Oh, God
label2 It's all right
label2 It's all right
label2 You're gonna be all right
label2 We got you
label2 Fire's out
label2 [ Screaming Continues ]  Junior
label2 We gotta get him out of here
label2 Come on
label2 We're walking you out
label2 Junior
label2 Behind you
label2 Open the door
label2 Come on
label2 Come on
label2 Come on
label2 Come and get me, fucker
label2 â™ª â™ª [ Woman Vocalizing ]  Even for those who have fallen,  this is a time of rejoicing
label2 They will live forever
label2 Those that are dead are not dead
label2 They have moved up
label2 They have moved to a higher place
label2 Crazy bastards
label2 Keeps 'em out of mischief
label2 You're not the religious type
label2 Me
label2 I've got a job
label2 They open the door, go in there with smart guns and kill it
label2 What have you heard from them
label2 Nothing much
label2 We got a message received
label2 Later, we got something that said you were top priority
label2 They don't cut us in on much
label2 What if they don't want to kill it
label2 Take it back
label2 Yeah
label2 They're not lunatics, you know
label2 Right
label2 Morse, please, cut me loose
label2 No fucking way
label2 Come on, man
label2 It hurts
label2 Oh, sorry
label2 I haven't done nothing
label2 Just don't talk to me
label2 Please
label2 I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
label2 I'm gonna sit here and guard your ass like l'm supposed to
label2 I don't need any fucking trouble with Dillon
label2 All I did was tell 'em about the dragon, what it did to Boggs and Rains
label2 You saw it
label2 Fuckin' "A" I saw it
label2 Oh, please
label2 I can't run
label2 It's not going to get in here
label2 We got it trapped
label2 So what's the big deal
label2 Come on
label2 Let me loose, man
label2 Yeah
label2 Aren't I your friend
label2 I love you, Morse
label2 [ Trimmer Clatters ]  Why not
label2 No fucking around...  or I'll get nothing but shit
label2 So where they got it
label2 [ Chuckles ] In the waste tank
label2 Gotta see it again
label2 What the fuck you talking about
label2 No more cigarettes for you
label2 Right
label2 We got the first part
label2 Tell them we trapped it
label2 What do we call it
label2 A xenomorph
label2 Right
label2 Here
label2 Hey, wait a minute
label2 We can't kill it
label2 We don't have any weapons, right
label2 That's all they ever tell us
label2 Treat us like shit
label2 Off and on me now
label2 What the hell you talking about
label2 Talk to me, the beast
label2 You can't go in there, dickhead
label2 Sorry
label2 Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
label2 â™ª â™ª [ Vocalizing Continues ]   So, you're telling me they're coming to take this thing away
label2 Yeah, they're gonna try
label2 They don't wanna kill it
label2 We gotta figure out a way to do it before they come here
label2 Why do we have to kill it
label2 You just said the company's coming for it
label2 That's right
label2 Some sort of weapon
label2 Yeah, what's wrong with that
label2 They can't control it
label2 They don't understand
label2 Like I said, what's wrong with that
label2 were a religious man
label2 You don't understand, do you
label2 That world out there doesn't exist for us anymore
label2 We've got our own little world out here
label2 It ain't much, but it's ours
label2 So fuck everybody else
label2 Fuck them
label2 Hey, Dillon
label2 Yeah
label2 Miserable, crazy son of a bitch let him loose
label2 Got what he fucking deserved
label2 Well, now what are we gonna do
label2 Andrews was right
label2 [ Gasps ]  You okay
label2 Piss on her
label2 The fucking thing's loose out there
label2 What are we gonna do
label2 L just said that
label2 And you're the dumb prick that let Golic out
label2 You miserable little shit
label2 Cut that shit out
label2 Tell your fucking bozo to shape up
label2 have to get to the E.E.V
label2 Why
label2 What's up
label2 I just have to use the neuroscanner
label2 You don't look so good
label2 What are we gonna do
label2 Want a smack in the mouth, you stupid wanker
label2 Shut the fuck up and stop causing panic
label2 PanicYou're so fucking stupid, you couldn't spell it
label2 Don't talk to me about panic
label2 We're fucking screwed
label2 All right
label2 Now shut up, both of you
label2 Shut up
label2 Well, I'm out of ideas
label2 Oh, surprise me
label2 What about outside
label2 Great idea
label2 The rescue team's 1 0 hours away
label2 So that makes a lot of sense
label2 Wonderful
label2 You just want us to stay here and let this thing have us for lunch
label2 I want you to get everybody that's still left together
label2 Get 'em into the assembly hall
label2 Okay
label2 Need any help
label2 [ Exhales ]  I don't mean to scare you
label2 Do me a favor and run this keyboard, will you
label2 Okay
label2 What do I do
label2 Hit "B" or "C."  What's "C"
label2 "Display biofunctions.
label2 That's it
label2 Now what
label2 Hit "enhancement.
label2 Keep looking
label2 I don't know how to read this stuff
label2 Hemorrhaging will show as a dark patch
label2 hairline fractures through the base of the skull
label2 What is it
label2 I think you've got one inside of you
label2 That's not possible
label2 What does it look like
label2 I have to see it
label2 Freeze it
label2 You don't want to look at it
label2 Freeze it
label2 l'm sorry
label2 All right
label2 The fucking thing is loose
label2 A rescue team is on its way with guns and shit
label2 Right now there isn't any place that's real safe
label2 But we stay here, in the assembly hall
label2 This place never had any fucking air conditioning
label2 In the meantime, you lay low, be ready and stay right...  in case your time comes
label2 Don't you start bullshitting, Dillon
label2 We're gonna be trapped in here like rats
label2 You got a weapon
label2 You got a blade
label2 Then you take it out and you fucking use it
label2 So you think we're gonna stab this mothersucker to death
label2 No, I don't think shit
label2 Maybe
label2 Maybe you'll hurt it before it takes you out, huh
label2 Isn't that something
label2 And I'll tell you, until the rescue team gets here, we're fucked
label2 So you better get prepared
label2 Well, I ain't staying here
label2 Well, then, suit yourself
label2 Fire
label2 Yeah
label2 Holy shit
label2 Well, all right
label2 Fuckin' "A.
label2 Fuckin' "A.
label2 It's up
label2 What do you want to say
label2 Tell them the whole place has gone toxic
label2 Are you kidding
label2 Then they won't come here
label2 Yeah
label2 I know
label2 What are you talking about
label2 Our only hope is that they kill this fucker
label2 I don't know, freeze you  They can do an operation
label2 They've got the technology
label2 If this organism gets off the planet, it'll kill everything
label2 They just want it for their bioweapons division, okay
label2 So we can't let them come here
label2 Fuck you
label2 Look, I'm sorry you've got this thing inside you, but l'm getting rescued
label2 I don't give a shit about these stupid prisoners, but l've got a wife, a kid
label2 I'll go home on the next rotation
label2 This is hard
label2 I'm gonna send this message
label2 I'm sorry, babe
label2 It's classified
label2 Listen, you stupid little shit
label2 This has got to be done, okay
label2 No way
label2 You're not getting it
label2 No fucking way
label2 Understand
label2 I think you're okay
label2 Ah
label2 Thanks
label2 Have you got any ideas
label2 [ Exhales ]  It won't kill me
label2 I'm carrying the new queen
label2 You really wanna bet this thing's that smart
label2 Maybe I'll go find it
label2 See how smart it is
label2 You're gonna go and look for it
label2 I have a pretty good idea of where it is
label2 It's just down there... in the basement
label2 It's a metaphor
label2 Wanna come
label2 Where are you when I need you
label2 Don't be afraid
label2 You've been in my life so long,  I can't remember anything else
label2 Now do something for me
label2 It's easy
label2 Just  Just do what you do
label2 Oh
label2 It won't kill me
label2 You're supposed to be laying low
label2 I have one inside of me
label2 Big one won't kill its own
label2 What are you talking about
label2 I just saw it,  an hour ago
label2 I could've been lunch, but it wouldn't touch me
label2 It ran away
label2 It knows I'm carrying its future
label2 Aw, bullshit
label2 I saw it... on the CAT scan
label2 It's a queenan egg layer
label2 Still sounds like bullshit to me
label2 If that thing's inside you, how'd it get there
label2 When I was in hypersleep, I guess
label2 L was violated
label2 Now I get to be the mother
label2 I need you to help me
label2 I need you to kill me
label2 I'm dead anyway
label2 I can't survive it
label2 But the one inside of me can generate thousands more,  can wipe out the whole universe
label2 Lt has to die
label2 So somebody's gotta kill me
label2 Are you up to it
label2 No speeches
label2 No prayers
label2 I don't like losing a fight
label2 Not to nobody, not to nothing
label2 Fuck
label2 That damn thing out there has already killed half my men,  got the other half scared shitless
label2 As long as it's alive, sister, you're not gonna save any universe
label2 You fucking coward
label2 I want that thing
label2 I want to get this thing, and I need you to do it
label2 Otherwise, fuck you
label2 Go kill yourself
label2 We waste this thing,  then you take care of me
label2 No problem
label2 Quick, easy and painless
label2 This is the choice
label2 At least we take a shot
label2 We owe it one
label2 It's fucked us up
label2 Maybe we can get even for the others
label2 Now how do you want it
label2 I'm talkin' about killing that big motherfucker
label2 The rescue team's on its way
label2 We could just sit this out
label2 [ Ripley ] Rescue team for whom
label2 For us
label2 They just want the beast
label2 I don't give a damn what they want
label2 They're not gonna pick us off one by one, are they
label2 I wouldn't be so sure
label2 Come on
label2 They're gonna take us home
label2 They're not gonna take us home
label2 Jesus Christ
label2 Give us a break
label2 You guys have got to be fucking nuts
label2 Look, I've got a wife and a kid
label2 You're not one of us
label2 You're not a believer
label2 You're a fucking company man
label2 Okay, I'm a company man and not a fucking criminal
label2 Well, I'm smart enough not to have a life sentence on this rock
label2 Fuck you
label2 Piss off, 85
label2 Yeah, and I'm smart enough to wait for some firepower to show up before we fight this thing
label2 Right, Morse
label2 Right
label2 Okay
label2 Just sit here on your asses
label2 How about if I sit here on my ass
label2 No problem
label2 Oh, I forgot
label2 You're the guy that's made a deal with God...  to live forever, huh
label2 Me and her'll do all the fighting
label2 Okay
label2 I want to see it dead
label2 I hate the fucker
label2 Why the fuck can't we wait for the company and have some guns on our side
label2 Why do we have to go on some fucking suicide run
label2 Right
label2 Because they won't kill it
label2 They might kill you just for having seen it
label2 But they're not gonna kill it
label2 That is crazy
label2 That is horseshit
label2 The next time they sent in marines
label2 They were expendable too
label2 What makes you think they're gonna care about a bunch of lifers...  who found God at the ass end of space
label2 You really think they're going to let you...  interfere with their plans for this thing
label2 They think we'rewe're crud
label2 And they don't give a fuck about one friend of yours...  that'sthat's died
label2 Have you got some sort of plan
label2 This is a lead works, isn't it
label2 All we got to do is lure the fucking beast into the mold,  drown it in hot lead
label2 All right
label2 So how do we do that
label2 What are we gonna use for bait
label2 We're all gonna die
label2 The only question is when
label2 This is as good a place as any...  to take your first steps to heaven
label2 Only question is how you check out
label2 Do you want it on your feet...  or on your fucking knees, begging
label2 I ain't much for begging
label2 So I say fuck that thing
label2 Let's fight it
label2 Fuck it
label2 Let's go for it
label2 What if it runs at us
label2 That's a fucking good idea
label2 Channel "A," Door 1 open
label2 We fired it up five, six years ago
label2 You sure the piston's gonna work
label2 There's nothing for sure in this place
label2 We trap it here first, then you pull the lever, start the piston
label2 Then the piston's gonna push the mothersucker right into the mold
label2 Then one of the guys will pour the lead
label2 End of story
label2 What if somebody screws it up
label2 You got one chance
label2 One shot at it
label2 That's all
label2 We'll never have time to reset it
label2 Now remember, when you pull the lever,  for a few seconds you're gonna be trapped in here with that fuckin' thing
label2 If you guys don't drop the ball, I won't
label2 Well, you just better be right about that thing not wanting you
label2 Where are you gonna be
label2 I'll be around
label2 What about the others
label2 Where are they
label2 Praying
label2 You believe in this heaven shit
label2 I don't know
label2 Me neither

label2 You're a droid
label2 Sent by the fucking company
label2 No
label2 I designed it
label2 I'm very human
label2 The company sent me here to show you a friendly face,  to demonstrate how important you are to us,  to me
label2 You just want to take it back
label2 We want to kill it and take you home
label2 You're wrong
label2 We want to help
label2 We're gonna take that out of you

label2 <i>With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels.</i>  I can't think of anything
label2 <i>For a second, I forget about Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>  <i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>  It's getting exciting now

label2 Bob had bitch tits.</i>  <i>This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.</i>  <i>The big moosie slobbering all over me, that was Bob.</i>  We're still men

label2 See the guys with testicular cancer
label2 That's pain
label2 I always wanted three kids... two boys and a girl
label2 Mindy wanted two girls and a boy
label2 Well, I... She...  She had her first child last week
label2 With... With her... With her new husband
label2 Fuck
label2 Thank God, you know..
label2 I'm glad for her
label2 Thank you, Thomas
label2 I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage
label2 And that gives me strength
label2 It's time for the oneonones
label2 So let's all of us follow Thomas's example and really open ourselves up
label2 Could you find a partner
label2 <i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>  <i>His eyes already shrinkwrapped in tears.</i>  <i>Knees together
label2 Those awkward little steps.</i>   My name is Bob
label2 Bob
label2 <i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>  <i>You know that chest expansion programme on latenight TV?</i>  <i>That was his idea.</i>  I was a juicer
label2 Diabonal and  Wisterol
label2 Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Christ sakes
label2 I'm divorced
label2 My two grown kids  won't even return my phone calls
label2 <i>Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>  Go ahead,... Cornelius
label2 You can cry
label2 I let go.</i>  That's really good
label2 <i>Lost in oblivion.</i>  <i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>  <i>I found freedom
label2 Losing all hope was freedom.</i>  It's OK.  <i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>  <i>I became addicted.</i>  If I didn't say anything  people always assumed the worst
label2 They cried harder... then I cried harder
label2 It moves over your body, healing you
label2 Now keep this going
label2 Remember to breathe  and step forward through the back door of the room
label2 Where does it lead
label2 To your cave
label2 That's right
label2 You're going deeper into your cave
label2 And you're going to find  your power animal
label2 Slide
label2 <i>Every evening I died.</i>  <i>And every evening I was born again.</i>  <i>Resurrected.</i>  <i>Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too.</i>  <i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i>  <i>ready to cry.</i>  <i>This was my vacation.</i>  <i>And she</i>  <i>ruined everything.</i>  This is cancer, right
label2 <i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i>  <i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>  <i>She was a liar.</i>  <i>She had no diseases at all.</i>  <i>I had seen her at Free And Clear, my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>  <i>Then at Hope, my bimonthly sicklecell circle.</i>  <i>And again, at Seize The Day, my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>  <i>Marla,</i>  <i>the big tourist.</i>  <i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>  <i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>  <i>I couldn't cry
label2 You big tourist, I need this
label2 Now, get out
label2 <i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>  <i>We'll just let that dry...</i>  <i>When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep.</i>  <i>And you're never really awake.</i>  To begin tonight's communion,  Chloe would like to say a few words
label2 Chloe.</i>  <i>Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton would look if you made it walk around</i>  <i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>  Well, I'm still here
label2 But I don't know for how long
label2 That's as much certainty as anyone can give me
label2 I no longer have any fear of death
label2 But..
label2 I am in a pretty lonely place
label2 I'm so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time
label2 I have pornographic movies in my apartment,   and lubricants and amyl nitrite
label2 Thank you, Chloe
label2 Everyone, let's thank Chloe
label2 Thank you, Chloe
label2 You're standing at the entrance of your cave
label2 You step inside your cave and you walk...  <i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>  <i>Marla.</i>  <i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.</i>  <i>But you can't.</i>  <i>..deeper into your cave as you walk.</i>  <i>You feel a healing energy all around you.</i>  <i>Now find your power animal.</i>  Slide
label2 OK. Let's partner up
label2 Pick someone special to you tonight
label2 Hey
label2 We need to talk
label2 What
label2 Yeah
label2 You're a faker
label2 You're not dying
label2 Sorry
label2 In the Tibetanphilosophy, SylviaPlath sense of the word, I know we're all dying
label2 But you're not dying the way Chloe is
label2 So
label2 I've seen you
label2 I saw you at melanoma, I saw you at tuberculosis
label2 I saw you practising this
label2 Practising what
label2 Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert
label2 I'll expose you
label2 Go ahead
label2 I'll expose you
label2 Come together
label2 Let yourselves cry
label2 Oh, God
label2 It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee
label2 Look, this is important
label2 These are my groups
label2 I've been coming for over a year
label2 I don't know
label2 Instead of waiting for their turn to speak
label2 Yeah
label2 Yeah
label2 Share yourself... completely
label2 Look, you don't want to get into this
label2 Really
label2 I'm not kidding
label2 I can't cry if another faker is present, and I need this
label2 You gotta find somewhere else to go
label2 Candystripe a cancer ward
label2 It's not my problem
label2 Hold on
label2 We'll split up the week, OK
label2 You take lymphoma and tuberculosis
label2 You take tuberculosis
label2 OK. Good
label2 Fine
label2 Testicular cancer should be no contest
label2 Technically, I have more right to be there
label2 You still have your balls
label2 I dunno
label2 Am I
label2 No
label2 What do you want
label2 I'll take the parasites
label2 Take the blood parasites
label2 I want brain parasites
label2 I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia
label2 You can't have the whole brain
label2 So far, you have four
label2 I only have two
label2 OK. Take both the parasites
label2 They're yours
label2 Now we both have three...  Hey
label2 You left half your clothes
label2 What, are you selling those
label2 I'm selling some clothes
label2 We each have three
label2 That's six
label2 What about the seventh day
label2 I want bowel cancer
label2 <i>The girl had done her homework.</i>  No
label2 I want bowel cancer
label2 That's your favorite too
label2 Tried to slip it by me, eh
label2 Look, we'll split it
label2 Deal
label2 Looks like this is goodbye
label2 Let's not make a big thing out of it
label2 How's this for not making a big thing
label2 Hey, Marla
label2 Marla
label2 We might wanna switch nights
label2 OK.  <i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>  <i>Marla's philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.</i>  <i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>  It doesn't have your name
label2 Who are you
label2 Cornelius
label2 Rupert
label2 Travis
label2 Any of the stupid names you give each night
label2 <i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>  <i>SFO
label2 Mountain
label2 Central
label2 Lose an hour
label2 <i>This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>  <i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>  <i>If you wake up at a different time, in a different place,</i>  <i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>  <i>Everywhere I travel,</i>  <i>tiny life.</i>  <i>Singleserving sugar and cream.</i>  <i>Single pat of butter.</i>  <i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>  <i>Shampooconditioner combos.</i>  <i>Samplepackage mouthwash
label2 Tiny bars of soap.</i>  <i>The people I meet on each flight,</i>  <i>they're singleserving friends.</i>  <i>Between takeoff and landing, we have our time together.</i>  <i>That's all we get.</i>  <i>Welcome!</i>  <i>On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>  <i>I was a recall coordinator
label2 My job was to apply the formula.</i>  The infant went through the windshield
label2 <i>A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>  <i>The rear differential locks up.</i>  The teenager's braces are stuck to the ashtray
label2 <i>The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.</i>  <i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>  The father must have been huge
label2 See where the fat burned to the seat
label2 Very modern art
label2 <i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>  <i>Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.</i>  <i>Multiply the result by the average outofcourt settlement, C.</i>  <i>A x B x C</i>  equals X
label2 If X is less than the cost of a recall,  we don't do one
label2 Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents
label2 You wouldn't believe
label2 A major one
label2 <i>Every time the plane banked too sharply on takeoff or landing,</i>  <i>I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.</i>  <i>Anything.</i>  <i>Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.</i>  "If you are seated in an emergency exit row  and would be unable or unwilling to perform the duties  listed on the safety card, please ask a flight attendant to reseat you.
label2 Wanna switch seats
label2 No
label2 I'm not sure I'm the man for that particularjob
label2 An exitdoor procedure at 30,000ft
label2 The illusion of safety
label2 Yeah
label2 I guess so
label2 So you can breathe
label2 Oxygen gets you high
label2 In a catastrophic emergency, you take giant panic breaths
label2 Suddenly you become euphoric, docile
label2 You accept your fate
label2 Blank faces
label2 Calm as Hindu cows
label2 That's...  That's an interesting theory
label2 What do you do
label2 What do you mean
label2 Why
label2 So you can pretend you're interested
label2 OK.  You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh
label2 Soap
label2 Sorry
label2 I make and I sell soap
label2 The yardstick of civilization
label2 <i>And this is how I met...</i>  Tyler Durden
label2 Did you know if you mix gasoline and frozen orange juice, you can make napalm
label2 No, I did not
label2 Is that true
label2 One can make all kinds of explosives with simple household items
label2 Really
label2 If one was so inclined
label2 Tyler, you are by far the most interesting singleserving friend I have ever met
label2 Very clever
label2 How's it working out for you
label2 What
label2 Being clever
label2 Great
label2 Right up
label2 A question of etiquette
label2 As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch
label2 <i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>  <i>Airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.</i>   Was it ticking
label2 Throwers know modern bombs don't tick
label2 Sorry, throwers
label2 Baggage handlers
label2 My suitcase was vibrating
label2 Nine times out of ten  it's an electric razor
label2 But... every once in a while  it's a dildo
label2 <i>We have to use the indefinite article, a dildo, never</i>  <i>your dildo.</i>  I don't own...  <i>I had everything in that suitcase
label2 My CK shirts.</i>  <i>My DKNYshoes
label2 My AX ties.</i>  <i>Never mind.</i>  Hey
label2 That's my car
label2 <i>Home was a condo on the 15th floor</i>  <i>of a filing cabinet for widows and professionals.</i>  <i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>  <i>A foot of concrete is important</i>  <i>when your nextdoor neighbor has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>  <i>Or when a blast of debris that used to be your personal effects</i>  <i>blows out of your windows and sails flaming into the night.</i>  <i>I suppose these things happen.</i>  There's... nothing up there
label2 Police orders
label2 Do you have somebody you can call
label2 Who's this?</i>  <i> Tyler
label2 Who is this?</i>  We met... We met on the airplane
label2 We had the same suitcase
label2 The clever guy
label2 Right.</i>  I called a second ago
label2 There was no answer
label2 <i> I'm at a payphone
label2 Yeah, I *69'd you
label2 I never pick up my phone.</i>  <i>So what's up?</i>  Well
label2 You know, it could be worse
label2 A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep and toss it out of a car
label2 There's always that
label2 When you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that's it
label2 That's the last sofa I'll need
label2 Whatever happens, that sofa problem is handled
label2 I had it all
label2 I had a stereo that was very decent
label2 I was close to being complete
label2 Shit, man
label2 Now it's all gone
label2 All gone
label2 All gone
label2 A comforter
label2 Just a blanket
label2 Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is
label2 Is this essential to our survival in the huntergatherer sense
label2 No
label2 I dunno
label2 Consumers
label2 Right
label2 We're consumers
label2 We are byproducts of a lifestyle obsession
label2 These things don't concern me
label2 What concerns me are celebrity magazines,  television with 500 channels,  some guy's name on my underwear
label2 Viagra
label2 Olestra
label2 Martha Stewart
label2 Fuck Martha Stewart
label2 It's all going down
label2 So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns
label2 I say never be complete
label2 I say stop being perfect
label2 I say let's evolve
label2 Let the chips fall where they may
label2 But that's me, and I could be wrong
label2 It's just stuff
label2 Not a tragedy...  You did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living
label2 Fuck, you're right
label2 I don't smoke
label2 My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...  What
label2 Do what you like, man
label2 Oh, it's late
label2 Hey, thanks for the beer
label2 Yeah, man
label2 What
label2 What
label2 A hotel
label2 Yeah
label2 What are you talking about
label2 Oh, God
label2 Three pitchers of beer and you still can't ask
label2 You called me because you needed a place to stay
label2 Oh, hey
label2 Yes, you did
label2 So just ask
label2 Cut the foreplay and just ask, man
label2 Would... Would that be a problem
label2 Is it a problem for you to ask
label2 Yeah
label2 Thanks
label2 I want you to do me a favor
label2 Yeah, sure
label2 I want you to hit me as hard as you can
label2 What
label2 <i>Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.</i>  <i>Tyler was a night person.</i>  While the rest of us slept, he worked
label2 A movie doesn't come all on one big reel
label2 It comes on a few
label2 Someone has to switch the projectors at the exact moment  that one reel ends and the next one begins
label2 In the industry, we call them cigarette burns
label2 That's the cue for a changeover
label2 He flips the projectors, movie keeps going and the audience has no idea
label2 Why would anyone want this shitjob
label2 Because it affords him interesting opportunities
label2 Like splicing a frame of pornography into family films
label2 So when the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices first meet,  that's when you'll catch a flash of Tyler's contribution to the film
label2 Nice, big cock
label2 Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work
label2 <i>He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.</i>  Do not watch
label2 I cannot go when you watch
label2 Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque, he farted on meringues,  and as for the cream of mushroom soup...  Go ahead, tell 'em
label2 You just want me to hit you
label2 Come on
label2 Do me this one favor
label2 Why
label2 I don't know
label2 Never been in a fight
label2 You
label2 But that's a good thing
label2 I don't wanna die without any scars
label2 Come on
label2 Hit me, before I lose my nerve
label2 Oh, God
label2 This is crazy
label2 Let it rip
label2 I don't know about this
label2 I don't either
label2 Who gives a shit
label2 Noone's watching
label2 What do you care
label2 This is crazy
label2 That's right
label2 Where
label2 Like, in the face
label2 This is so fucking stupid
label2 Motherfucker
label2 He hit me in the ear
label2 Well, Jesus, I'm sorry
label2 Why the ear, man
label2 No, that was perfect
label2 No, it's all right
label2 It really hurts
label2 Right
label2 Hit me again
label2 No, you hit me
label2 We should do this again sometime
label2 Where's your car
label2 What car
label2 That's you
label2 That's me
label2 That's the toilet
label2 Good
label2 Yeah, thanks
label2 <i>What a shithole.</i>  <i>Nothing worked.</i>  <i>Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.</i>  <i>There were no neighbors
label2 Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>  <i>That fart smell of steam
label2 Hey, guys
label2 Hey
label2 <i>Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.</i>  <i>By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV.</i>  <i>I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.</i>  Can I be next
label2 Lose the tie
label2 <i>At night, Tyler and I were alone for half a mile in every direction.</i>  <i>Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>  <i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>  <i>Everywhere were rusted nails to snag your elbow on.</i>  <i>The previous occupant had been a shutin.</i>  Hey, man
label2 What are you reading
label2 Listen to this
label2 "I am Jack's medulla oblongata
label2 Without me,  Jack could not regulate his heart rate or breathing.
label2 There's a whole series of these
label2 "I Am Jill's Nipples.
label2 "I Am Jack's Colon.
label2 I Kill Jack.
label2 <i> You could deal with anything
label2 Have you finished those reports?</i>  <i>If you could choose, who would you fight?</i>  I'd fight my boss, probably
label2 Really
label2 Yeah, why
label2 I'd fight my dad
label2 I don't know my dad
label2 I mean, I know him, but..
label2 He left when I was like, six years old
label2 He did this every six years
label2 He changes city and starts a new family
label2 Fucker's setting up franchises
label2 So it was real important that I go
label2 That sounds familiar
label2 So I graduate
label2 Call him up longdistance and say, "Dad, now what?
label2 He says, "Get ajob.
label2 Same here
label2 Make my yearly call again
label2 "Dad, now what?
label2 He says, "I dunno
label2 Get married.
label2 You can't get married
label2 I'm a 30yearold boy
label2 I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need
label2 <i>Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>  <i>But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.</i>  <i>We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.</i>  <i>It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>  <i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>  <i>I should have been looking for a new condo or haggling with my insurance company.</i>  <i>I should have been upset about my nice flaming little shit.</i>  <i>But I wasn't.</i>  The premise of cybernetting an office is make things more efficient
label2 <i>Monday mornings, I just thought about next week.</i>  Can I get the icon in cornflower blue
label2 Absolutely
label2 Because waste is a thief
label2 You liked it, didn't you
label2 <i>You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.</i>  <i>It was right in everyone's face.</i>  <i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>  <i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i>  <i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>  Come on, you've gotta go home
label2 Turn off the jukebox
label2 Lock the back
label2 <i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.</i>  Gentlemen
label2 Welcome to Fight Club
label2 The first rule of Fight Club is  you do not talk about Fight Club
label2 Third rule of Fight Club
label2 Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,  the fight is over
label2 Only two guys to a fight
label2 Fifth rule
label2 One fight at a time, fellas
label2 Sixth rule
label2 No shirts
label2 Seventh rule
label2 Fights will go on as long as they have to
label2 And the eighth and final rule
label2 If this is your first night at Fight Club  you have to fight
label2 <i>You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.</i>  <i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>  <i>Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight,</i>  <i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>  <i>Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were outside of it.</i>  <i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time
label2 Alive or dead
label2 Doesn't matter
label2 Who'd be tough
label2 Hemingway
label2 You
label2 Shatner
label2 I'd fight William Shatner
label2 Oh, selfimprovement is masturbation
label2 Now, selfdestruction..
label2 Excuse me
label2 Stop
label2 <i>When the fight was over, nothing was solved.</i>  <i>But nothing mattered.</i>  Cool
label2 <i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>  Hey, man
label2 How about next week
label2 How about next month?
label2 New guy, you too
label2 <i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>  He fell down some stairs
label2 I fell down some stairs
label2 <i>Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>  OK. Any historical figure
label2 Good answer
label2 How about you
label2 Lincoln
label2 Lincoln
label2 Big guy, big reach
label2 Fuck
label2 Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart
label2 Hello
label2 You left a forwarding number.</i>  I haven't seen you at any support groups
label2 <i>We split 'em up
label2 That was the idea
label2 Remember?</i>  Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours
label2 How do you know
label2 I found a new one
label2 Really
label2 It's for men only
label2 Like the testicle thing
label2 I've been going to Debtors Anonymous
label2 I'm on my way out.</i>  Me too
label2 I've got a stomach full of Xanax
label2 I took what was left of a bottle
label2 It might have been too much
label2 <i>Picture Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.</i>  This isn't a forreal suicide thing
label2 So you're staying in tonight, then
label2 Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death
label2 <i>Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>  <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>  <i>Tyler's door was closed
label2 I'd been here for two months and his door was never closed.</i>  You won't believe this dream I had last night
label2 I can hardly believe anything about last night
label2 What
label2 This is my house
label2 What are you doing here
label2 Fuck you
label2 Oh, you've got some fuckedup friends
label2 Silly cooze
label2 I come in last night
label2 Phone's off the hook
label2 <i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>  <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>  Do you think it'll live up to its name
label2 <i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>  <i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>  <i>Ten,</i>  <i>nine,... eight...</i>  <i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>  <i>think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>  <i>Five,</i>  <i>four...</i>  Hang on
label2 You got here fast
label2 Did I call you
label2 The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic
label2 It's not a threat to you
label2 Oh, fuck
label2 Somebody called the cops
label2 End of the hall
label2 The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl
label2 She has lost faith in herself
label2 She's a monster
label2 You have every reason to live
label2 She's infectious human waste
label2 Miss Singer
label2 If I fall asleep,  I'm done for
label2 You're gonna have to keep me up  all night
label2 Unfuckingbelievable
label2 <i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>   You know what I mean, you fucked her
label2 No, I didn't
label2 Never
label2 No
label2 God, not at all
label2 <i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>  Are you sure
label2 You can tell me
label2 <i> Put a gun to my head and spray my brains
label2 That's good.</i>  She's a predator posing as a house pet
label2 Stay away
label2 The shit that came out of this woman's mouth, I had never heard
label2 My God
label2 I haven't been fucked like that since grade school
label2 <i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>  <i>The other night, he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.</i>  Marla doesn't need a lover, just a caseworker
label2 This isn't love, it's sport fucking
label2 Sit down
label2 Now, listen
label2 I can't have you talking to her about me
label2 Why would I...  Say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or anybody,... we're done
label2 Now promise me
label2 You promise
label2 OK.   Yeah, I promise
label2 Promise
label2 What...  That's three times you promised
label2 <i>If only I had wasted a few minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>  <i>none of this would have happened.</i>  Harder, yes
label2 <i>I could have moved to another room.</i>  <i>On the third floor where I might not have heard them.</i>  <i>But I didn't.</i>   What are you doing
label2 Just going to bed
label2 Wanna finish her off
label2 No
label2 No, thank you
label2 Who were you talking to
label2 Shut up
label2 <i>I became the calm little center of the world.</i>  <i>I was the Zen master.</i>  <i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>  <i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>  Is that your blood
label2 Some of it, yeah
label2 Take the rest of the day off
label2 Come back Monday with some clean clothes
label2 Get yourself together
label2 "</i>  <i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that
label2 "</i>  <i>"I am enlightened
label2 "</i>  <i>You give up the condo life, give up all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>  <i>move to a dilapidated house in a toxic waste area,</i>  <i>and you have to come home to this.</i>  <i> Hello
label2 This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.</i>  <i>We have some new information about the incident at your former condo.</i>  Yes
label2 <i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>  No, I wasn't aware of that
label2 <i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>  Does this sound strange to you
label2 <i>Yes, sir, strange
label2 Very strange.</i>  <i> The dynamite  Dynamite?</i>  left a residue of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride
label2 No, what does it mean?</i>  It means it was homemade
label2 I'm sorry
label2 This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir
label2 <i> The gas was just a detonator
label2 Who would go and do that?</i>  <i> I'll ask the questions
label2 Tell him.</i>  Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property realigned my perceptions
label2 <i>Excuse me
label2 Are you there?</i>  I am listening
label2 Have you recently made enemies who might have access to homemade dynamite
label2 Enemies
label2 Reject civilization,  especially material possessions
label2 <i> Son, this is serious
label2 Yes, it's very serious.</i>  Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me
label2 That condo was my life
label2 OK
label2 I loved every stick of furniture in that place
label2 I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>  <i> Is this not a good time for you
label2 Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>  Tell him you blew it all up
label2 That's what he wants to hear
label2 <i> Are you still there
label2 Wait
label2 I may need to talk to you, so you let me know if you're gonna leave town
label2 OK.</i>  <i>Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.</i>  <i>My parents pulled this exact same act for years.</i>  The condom is the glass slipper of our generation
label2 You slip one on when you meet a stranger
label2 You... dance all night
label2 Then you throw it away
label2 The condom, I mean
label2 Not the stranger
label2 What
label2 I got this dress at a thrift store for $1
label2 It's a bridesmaid's dress
label2 Someone loved it intensely  for one day
label2 Like a Christmas tree
label2 So special
label2 It's on the side of the road
label2 Tinsel still clinging to it
label2 Like a sex crime victim
label2 Underwear inside out
label2 Bound with electrical tape
label2 Well then, it suits you
label2 Get rid of her
label2 <i> What
label2 You get rid of her
label2 Don't mention me.</i>  <i>I am six years old again, passing messages between parents.</i>   I really think it's time you left
label2 Don't worry, I'm leaving
label2 You are such a nutcase
label2 I can't keep up
label2 Gotta get off  Thanks
label2 Bye
label2 Why do you still waste time with her
label2 <i>At least she's trying to hit bottom.</i>  And I'm not
label2 Feathers up your butt do not make you a chicken
label2 What are we doing tonight
label2 Tonight... we make soap
label2 To make soap, first we render fat
label2 The salt balance has to be just right  so the best fat for soap comes from humans
label2 Wait, what is this place
label2 A liposuction clinic
label2 Richest, creamiest fat in the world
label2 Fat of the land
label2 No
label2 Don't pull it, don't pull it
label2 Oh, God
label2 As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface
label2 Like in Boy Scouts
label2 It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout
label2 Keep stirring
label2 Once the tallow hardens, you skim off a layer of glycerin
label2 Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin
label2 Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust, you've got dynamite
label2 <i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>  People found clothes got cleaner when washed at a certain point in the river
label2 No
label2 Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river
label2 Bodies burnt
label2 Water permeated the ashes to create lye
label2 This is lye
label2 Once it mixed with the melted body fat, a white soapy discharge crept into the river
label2 May I see your hand, please
label2 What is this
label2 It will hurt more than any burn and it will leave a scar
label2 <i>Meditation worked for cancer, it could work now.</i>   Don't shut the pain out
label2 Oh, God
label2 The first soap was made from heroes' ashes, like the first monkey shot into space
label2 <i>I tried not to think of the word searing of flesh.</i>  Stop it
label2 This is your pain, this is your burning hand
label2 I'm going to my cave to find my power animal
label2 No
label2 Don't deal with this the way those dead people do
label2 I get the point
label2 No
label2 You're feeling premature enlightenment
label2 It's the greatest moment of your life, and you're off somewhere else
label2 Shut up
label2 Our fathers were our models for God
label2 If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God
label2 You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you
label2 He never wanted you
label2 In all probability, He hates you
label2 This is not the worst thing that can happen
label2 We don't need Him
label2 I agree
label2 We are God's unwanted children
label2 So be it
label2 I'm getting water
label2 You can use water and make it worse or...   Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn
label2 First, you have to give up
label2 You don't know how this feels
label2 It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything
label2 OK.  Congratulations
label2 You're one step closer to hitting the bottom
label2 <i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar.</i>  <i>God knows what they charged.</i>   This is the best soap
label2 Why, thank you, Susan
label2 <i>It was beautiful.</i>  <i>We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.</i>  <i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>  <i>I didn't wear a tie to work any more.</i>  "The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club.
label2 <i>I'm halfasleep again
label2 Pretend you're me
label2 Make a managerial decision
label2 What would you do
label2 Well, I gotta tell you,  I'd be very, very careful who you talk to about that
label2 Because the person who wrote that is dangerous
label2 And this buttondown, Oxfordcloth psycho might just snap  and then stalk from office to office  with an Armalite AR10 carbine gaspowered semiautomatic weapon,  pumping round after round into colleagues and coworkers
label2 Someone very, very close to you
label2 <i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>  <i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>  Or maybe you shouldn't bring me every piece of trash you pick up
label2 Compliance and Liability
label2 My tit's gonna rot off
label2 I need to take this
label2 What do you mean
label2 Go to a hospital
label2 I can't afford to waste money on a doctor
label2 I don't know about this, Marla
label2 Please
label2 <i>She didn't call Tyler
label2 Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines
label2 Where are they, exactly
label2 Tragically, they're dead
label2 I'm alive and I'm in poverty
label2 Want any
label2 No, no
label2 I got one for you
label2 What happened to your hand
label2 Oh, nothing
label2 Feel anything
label2 No
label2 OK, I'm pretty sure
label2 You feel nothing
label2 No, nothing
label2 Well, that's a relief
label2 Thank you
label2 No problem
label2 I wish I could return the favor
label2 Breast cancer doesn't run in my family
label2 I think I'm OK.  Well, thanks, anyway
label2 Are we done
label2 Yeah, we're done
label2 See you... around
label2 It's me
label2 Bob
label2 Hey, Bob
label2 We all thought you were dead
label2 No, no
label2 Still here
label2 How are you, Bob
label2 Better than I've ever been in my whole life
label2 Still remaining men together
label2 No, no
label2 I got something so much better now
label2 Well..
label2 The first rule is, I'm not supposed to talk about it
label2 And the second rule is  I'm not supposed to talk about it
label2 And the third rule is...  Bob, Bob
label2 Look at my face, Bob
label2 That's fucking... fucking great
label2 I've never seen you there
label2 I go Tuesdays and Thursdays
label2 I go Saturday
label2 Yeah, hey, to both of us, right
label2 Have you heard about the guy that invented it
label2 Yeah, actually..
label2 I hear all kinds of things
label2 He's a great man
label2 Do you know about Tyler Durden
label2 Actually, you did
label2 Thank you for this
label2 <i>Fight Club.</i>  <i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>  <i>Our gift to the world.</i>  I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces
label2 Shut up
label2 Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club
label2 I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived
label2 I see all this potential
label2 And I see it squandered
label2 Goddamn it, an entire generation pumping gas
label2 Waiting tables
label2 Working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need
label2 We're the middle children of history
label2 No purpose or place
label2 We have no Great War
label2 No Great Depression
label2 Our great depression is our lives
label2 We've all been raised on television to believe  that one day we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars
label2 But we won't
label2 We're slowly learning that fact
label2 And we're very, very pissed off
label2 Yeah
label2 Who am I
label2 Yeah
label2 There's a sign on the front that says Lou's Tavern
label2 I'm fucking Lou
label2 Tyler Durden
label2 We have a deal worked out with Irvine
label2 Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone
label2 He don't own this place
label2 I do
label2 How much money's he getting for this
label2 There is no money
label2 Free to all
label2 Ain't that something
label2 Look, stupid fuck
label2 I want everybody out of here right now
label2 You should join our club
label2 Did you hear what I just said
label2 You and your friend
label2 No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou
label2 Still not getting it
label2 OK, OK, I got it
label2 I got it, I got it
label2 Shit, I lost it
label2 Back
label2 Everybody back
label2 Ah, Lou
label2 Come on, man
label2 We really like this place
label2 That's right, Lou
label2 Shut the fuck up
label2 Oh, yeah
label2 Is that fucking funny
label2 Unbelievable
label2 You don't know where I've been, Lou
label2 Oh, my God
label2 You don't know where I've been
label2 Please, Lou
label2 Fucking use the basement
label2 Christ
label2 I want your word, Lou
label2 I want your word
label2 Thanks, Lou
label2 We'll see you next week
label2 This week, each one of you has a homework assignment
label2 You're gonna go out
label2 You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger
label2 Excellent choice, sir
label2 Hey
label2 Watch out, jackass
label2 <i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>  Son of a bitch
label2 <i>Most people, normal people, do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>  Excuse me
label2 You sprayed me with your hose
label2 That's not necessary...  Jay
label2 Put the hose down
label2 Stop it
label2 Stop it
label2 Sorry
label2 We need to talk
label2 With your constant absenteeism
label2 With your unpresentable appearance
label2 You're up for review
label2 I am Jack's complete lack of surprise
label2 Let's pretend
label2 You're the Department of Transportation, OK
label2 Someone informs you that this company  installs frontseat mounting brackets that failed collision tests,  brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,  and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive
label2 What then
label2 Are you threatening me
label2 No...  Get the fuck out of here
label2 I have a better solution
label2 In exchange for my salary,  my job will be never to tell people these things that I know
label2 I don't even have to come into the office
label2 I can do this job from home
label2 Who... Who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit
label2 I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>  What the hell are you doing
label2 That hurt
label2 Why would you do that
label2 Oh, my God
label2 No
label2 Please stop
label2 Oh, God, no
label2 Please
label2 No
label2 <i>For some reason, I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>  No
label2 Give me the paychecks, like I asked, and you won't ever see me again
label2 <i>Then, at our most excellent moment together...</i>  Thank God
label2 <i>Telephone, computer,</i>  <i>fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>  <i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>  <i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.</i>  <i>Now, the center of Fight Club became the two men fighting.</i>  <i>The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.</i>  <i>Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>  <i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>  <i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>  Thank you, sir
label2 <i>Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.</i>  <i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>   There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City
label2 Yeah, I heard
label2 There's one in Penns Grove too
label2 Bob even found one up in New Castle
label2 Did you start that one
label2 No
label2 Stop for a second
label2 Turn around
label2 What are we doing
label2 Homework assignment
label2 What kind
label2 Human sacrifice
label2 Is that a gun
label2 It's a gun
label2 What are you doing
label2 Meet me in the back
label2 Don't fuck around
label2 <i>On a long enough time line,</i>  <i>the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>  What are you doing
label2 Come on
label2 Hands behind your back
label2 Give me your wallet
label2 Raymond K Hessel
label2 Small, cramped basement apartment
label2 How did you know
label2 They give shitty apartments letters
label2 You're going to die
label2 No
label2 Is that your mom and dad
label2 Pick up your dental records
label2 Know why
label2 There'll be nothing left of your face
label2 Oh, come on
label2 An expired community college student ID
label2 S... S... Stuff
label2 Stuff
label2 I asked you what you studied
label2 Biology, mostly
label2 Why
label2 I don't know
label2 The question, Raymond, was what did you want to be
label2 Answer him, Raymond, Jesus
label2 Veterinarian
label2 Veterinarian
label2 Animals
label2 Animals and stuff
label2 Stuff
label2 Yeah, I got that
label2 So you need more schooling
label2 Too much school
label2 Would you rather be dead
label2 No, please...  You'd rather die here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store
label2 Gonna check in on you
label2 I know where you live
label2 If you're not working to be a veterinarian in six weeks,  you will be dead
label2 Now run on home
label2 Run, Forrest, run
label2 I feel ill
label2 Imagine how he feels
label2 What the fuck was the point of that?
label2 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K Hessel's life
label2 <i>You had to give it to him.</i>  <i> Come on
label2 He had a plan.</i>  <i>And it started to make sense in a Tylersort of way.</i>  <i>No fear
label2 No distractions.</i>  <i>The ability to let that which does not matter</i>  <i>truly slide.</i>  <i>You are not your job.</i>  You're not how much money you have in the bank
label2 You're not the car you drive
label2 You're not your fucking khakis
label2 You are the allsinging, alldancing crap of the world
label2 I'll be out of your way in a sec
label2 You don't have to go
label2 No, I mean..
label2 It's OK.  Are you still going to groups
label2 Yeah
label2 Chloe's dead
label2 Wow, Chloe
label2 When did that happen
label2 Do you care
label2 Yeah, well..
label2 It was the smart move on her part
label2 Listen...  What are you getting out of all this
label2 What
label2 I mean, all this
label2 Why do you keep...  Is this making you happy
label2 Yeah, well, sometimes
label2 I don't understand
label2 Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person
label2 What is... What is that
label2 What do you get out of it
label2 No... That's not the same thing at all
label2 Us
label2 I'm sorry
label2 Do you hear this
label2 Hear what
label2 All that noise
label2 Hold on
label2 No, wait
label2 Don't change the subject
label2 You're not talking about me, are you
label2 No
label2 Playing doctor
label2 What was going on there
label2 What are you talking about
label2 Nothing
label2 I don't think so
label2 What do you want
label2 Look at me
label2 No
label2 What is that?
label2 It's nothing
label2 My God
label2 Who did this
label2 A person
label2 Guy or girl
label2 What do you care
label2 What do you care if I ask
label2 Leave me alone
label2 I am not
label2 Let me go
label2 No
label2 Talk to me
label2 This conversation  This conversation   is over
label2 is over
label2 Hey, this is getting a little old
label2 What is... What is all this
label2 What do you think
label2 Hey, why do we need bunk beds
label2 Hey
label2 Too young
label2 Sorry
label2 If the applicant is young, tell him he's too young
label2 Old, too old
label2 Applicant
label2 If the applicant waits three days without food or shelter,  he may enter and begin training
label2 Training for what
label2 You think this is a game
label2 You're too young to train here, end of story
label2 Get the fuck out of here
label2 Bad news, friend
label2 It's not gonna happen
label2 Sorry if there was a misunderstanding
label2 It's not the end of the world
label2 Go
label2 You're trespassing and I will have to call the police
label2 Don't you look at me
label2 You're never getting in this fucking house
label2 Now get the fuck off my porch
label2 Get off my porch
label2 <i>Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>  I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna get a shovel
label2 Yes, sir
label2 Two pair of black pants

label2 And you... You're too fucking  blond
label2 Get out of here, the both of you
label2 <i>And so it went.</i>  Listen up, maggots
label2 You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake
label2 You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else
label2 <i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>  <i>We are the allsinging, alldancing crap of the world.</i>  <i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>  <i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>  <i>To what purpose?</i>  <i>For what greater good?</i>  <i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>  When he was like, "You are not yourjob",  I was like, "Yeah!
label2 Hey, what's all this
label2 OK
label2 What's going on
label2 We're celebrating
label2 What are we celebrating
label2 Go on
label2 Hey
label2 <i>Investigators are here
label2 The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>  <i>Could you tell us what you think has happened here?</i>  <i>We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism in the city</i>  <i>somehow related to underground boxing clubs.</i>  <i>We will be coordinating a rigorous investigation.</i>  <i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs who just arrived on the scene</i>  <i> of a fouralarm fire that broke out...  She's hot.</i>  <i>Back to you in the studio.</i>   Yeah
label2 Yeah
label2 Holy shit
label2 Yeah
label2 What the fuck did you guys do
label2 <i>Arson investigators are on the premises...</i>  Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir
label2 It will take dedication and commitment and, most of all, cooperation
label2 Streets are safer now
label2 There is hope in the inner city
label2 However..
label2 These are the first steps in a long journey
label2 That is why we have created Project Hope
label2 Bob
label2 Project Hope will be ajoint effort  between the police and community leaders
label2 It will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime
label2 His balls are ice cold
label2 Hi
label2 You will publicly state there is no underground group or  these guys are gonna take your balls
label2 <i>They'll send one to the New York Times and one to the LA Times.</i>  Look
label2 The people you are after are the people you depend on
label2 We cook your meals
label2 We connect your calls
label2 We drive your ambulances
label2 We guard you while you sleep
label2 Do not fuck with us
label2 Ball check
label2 Let's go
label2 Yeah
label2 <i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>  <i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>  <i>I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers</i>  <i>and smother those French beaches I'd never see.</i>  <i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>  Where did you go, psycho boy
label2 I felt like destroying something beautiful
label2 Get him to a fucking hospital
label2 Don't worry, Mr Durden
label2 Airport parking
label2 Long term
label2 After you, Mr Durden
label2 Something on your mind, dear
label2 No
label2 Yeah, why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem
label2 First rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions
label2 Fight Club was the beginning
label2 Now it's left the basements and it's Project Mayhem
label2 We started Fight Club together
label2 Remember
label2 It's as much mine as it is yours
label2 Yeah
label2 Weren't we doing this together
label2 This does not belong to us
label2 We are not special
label2 Fuck that
label2 You should have told me
label2 Hey, Tyler
label2 What do you want?
label2 A statement of purpose
label2 Should I email you
label2 Oh...  You decide your level of involvement
label2 I wanna know certain things first
label2 The first rule of Project Mayhem..
label2 Shut up
label2 I wanna know what you're thinking
label2 Forget about what you think you know about life, friendship,  and especially about you and me
label2 What is that supposed to mean
label2 What do you wish you'd done before you died
label2 Paint a selfportrait
label2 Build a house
label2 I don't know
label2 Nothing
label2 Get in the right lane
label2 You have to know
label2 If you died now, how would you feel about your life
label2 I don't know
label2 Nothing good
label2 Come on
label2 Stop fucking around
label2 Tyler
label2 Jesus Christ
label2 Goddamn it
label2 Goddamn it
label2 Fuck Fight Club
label2 Fuck Marla
label2 I am sick of all your shit
label2 Quit screwing around
label2 Steer
label2 Look at you
label2 Steer
label2 You're fucking pathetic
label2 Why
label2 Why
label2 What are you talking about
label2 Why do you think I blew up your condo
label2 What
label2 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat
label2 Stop trying to control everything and just let go
label2 All right
label2 Fine
label2 Fine
label2 <i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>  <i>This must have been what all those people felt like</i>  <i>before I filed them as statistics in my reports.</i>  Goddamn
label2 In the world I see,  you're stalking elk through the Grand Canyon forests  around the ruins of Rockefeller Center
label2 You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life
label2 You'll climb the thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower
label2 And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,  laying strips of venison in the empty carpool lane  of some abandoned superhighway
label2 Feel better, champ
label2 <i>And then...</i>  Tyler
label2 You know how much ether is here
label2 <i>Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.</i>  Hang on a second
label2 It's under control, sir
label2 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not..
label2 Right... OK.  <i>I'm all alone.</i>  <i>My father dumped me
label2 Tyler dumped me.</i>  <i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>  <i>What comes next in Project Mayhem only Tyler knows.</i>  <i>The second rule is you do not ask questions.</i>  Get the fuck away from me

label2 We had it all worked out, sir
label2 It went smooth until...  Police
label2 Freeze
label2 They shot Bob
label2 They shot him in the head
label2 Fucking pigs
label2 Those motherfuckers

label2 You're running around in ski masks trying to blow things up
label2 What did you think was gonna happen?
label2 Get rid of the evidence
label2 We gotta get rid of this body
label2 Bury him
label2 What
label2 Take him to the garden and bury him
label2 Come on, people, let's go
label2 Get away from him
label2 What are you talking about
label2 This is a person
label2 He's my friend and you're not burying him in the garden
label2 He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir
label2 This is Bob
label2 Sir, in..
label2 In Project Mayhem, we have no names
label2 This is a man and he has a name, and it's Robert Paulsen, OK
label2 He's a man  and he's dead now because of us
label2 Do you understand that
label2 I understand
label2 In death, a member of Project Mayhem  has a name
label2 His name... is Robert Paulsen
label2 His name is Robert Paulsen
label2 Come on, guys
label2 Stop it
label2 His name is Robert Paulsen
label2 Shut up
label2 This is all over with
label2 Get the fuck out of here
label2 No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit
label2 I need to see you...  <i>I went to all the cities on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.</i>  <i>I didn't know how or why, but I could look at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>  <i>I'm looking for Tyler Durden
label2 It's very important that I talk to him.</i>  I wish I could help you,  sir
label2 <i>Every city I went to,</i>  <i>as soon as I set foot off the plane</i>  <i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>  Hey
label2 Hey
label2 Taxi
label2 I'm a member
label2 Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler
label2 You're a moron
label2 I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
label2 <i>Tyler had been busy... setting up franchises all over the country.</i>  <i>Was I asleep
label2 Had I slept?</i>  <i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>   We've just heard the stories
label2 What kind of stories
label2 He has plastic surgery every three years
label2 That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard
label2 Is Mr Durden building an army
label2 <i>I was living in a state of perpetual dèŒ…jè„¿ vu.</i>  <i>Everywhere I went,</i>  <i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>  <i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>  <i>The smell of dried blood,</i>  <i>dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>  <i>That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.</i>  <i>The feel of a floor still warm from a fight the night before.</i>  <i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>  His name is Robert Paulsen..
label2 Welcome back, sir
label2 How have you been
label2 Do you know me
label2 Is this a test, sir
label2 No
label2 You were in here last Thursday
label2 Thursday
label2 You were standing where you are now, asking how good security is
label2 It's tight as a drum, sir
label2 Who do you think I am
label2 No, this is not a test
label2 You're Mr Durden
label2 You're the one who gave me this
label2 Marla, it's me.</i>  <i> Have we ever done it
label2 Done what?</i>  Had sex
label2 What kind of stupid question is that
label2 Stupid because it's yes or because it's no
label2 <i> Is this a trick
label2 I need to know...</i>  You wanna know if I think we were just having sex or making love
label2 <i> We did make love
label2 Did we do it or not?
label2 You fuck me, then snub me
label2 You're sensitive, then you turn into an asshole
label2 Does that describe our relationship, Tyler
label2 <i>We just lost cabin pressure.</i>  What did you just say
label2 What is wrong with you
label2 Say my name
label2 Tyler Durden
label2 You fucking freak
label2 What's going on
label2 I'm not there
label2 Jesus, Tyler
label2 You fucking talked to her about me
label2 What the fuck is going on
label2 I asked you for one thing
label2 One simple thing
label2 Why do people think that I'm you
label2 Answer me
label2 Answer me
label2 Why do people think I'm you
label2 I think you know
label2 No, I don't
label2 I..
label2 I don't know
label2 You got it
label2 No
label2 Do not fuck with us
label2 Because...  Say it
label2 Because we're the same person
label2 That's right
label2 <i>We are the allsinging, alldancing crap.</i>   I don't understand this
label2 You could not do this on your own
label2 All the ways you wish you could be,  that's me
label2 I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck
label2 I am smart, capable and, most importantly,  I'm free in all the ways that you are not
label2 Oh, no
label2 Tyler's not here
label2 Tyler went away
label2 This isn't possible
label2 This is crazy
label2 People do it every day
label2 They see themselves as they'd like to be
label2 They don't have the courage you have to just run with it
label2 We should do this again sometime
label2 At times, you imagine you're watching me
label2 If this is your first time, you have to fight
label2 Little by little, you're just letting yourself become  Tyler Durden
label2 You are not yourjob or how much money you have
label2 You have a house
label2 Rented in your name
label2 You have jobs, a life
label2 You work nights because you can't sleep
label2 Or you stay up and make soap
label2 You're fucking Marla, Tyler
label2 Oh, my God
label2 Now you see our dilemma
label2 She knows too much
label2 I think we're gonna have to talk about how this might compromise our goals
label2 What... What are you saying
label2 This is bullshit
label2 You are insane
label2 No
label2 You're insane
label2 <i>It's called a changeover.</i>  <i>The movie goes on</i>  <i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>   Sir
label2 Are you checking out
label2 Yeah
label2 Bill me
label2 When were these made
label2 Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning
label2 <i>Have I been going to bed earlier every night
label2 Have I been sleeping later?</i>  <i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>  Is anybody here
label2 <i>DèŒ…jè„¿ vu all over again.</i>  With enough soap, one could blow up anything
label2 <i> 1888.  Who am I calling?</i>  <i>1888 Franklin
label2 This is maintenance
label2 Hello?</i>  <i>Hello?</i>  1888 Franklin Street
label2 <i>Yes
label2 Yeah, yeah.</i>  I need to talk to your supervisor right away
label2 <i> Speaking
label2 OK, listen to me.</i>  Something terrible is about to happen to your building
label2 Don't worry about us, sir
label2 We're solid.</i>  <i>2160.</i>  Marla
label2 Marla
label2 Hey, wait
label2 Wait
label2 Marla
label2 Marla
label2 Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom
label2 They almost broke my arm
label2 They were burning their fingertips with lye
label2 Here comes an avalanche of bullshit
label2 I don't wanna hear anything you have to say
label2 You have every right to be..
label2 I'll just have a coffee, thanks
label2 Sir
label2 Anything you order is free of charge, sir
label2 Why is it free of charge
label2 Don't ask
label2 Whatever
label2 Clean food, please
label2 In that case, may I advise against the clam chowder
label2 No clam chowder
label2 You got about 30 seconds
label2 I know I've been acting very strange, OK
label2 I know it seems there's two sides to me...  Two sides
label2 You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass
label2 I know
label2 What
label2 The nature of our relationship wasn't clear  to me for reasons I won't go into
label2 I know I haven't treated you well
label2 Whatever
label2 Fifteen seconds, please
label2 I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry
label2 What I've come to realize is that I really like you, Marla
label2 You do
label2 I really do
label2 I care about you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of me
label2 What
label2 You need to leave town for a while
label2 Get out of any major city
label2 Just go camping...  You're an insane person
label2 I've involved you in something terrible
label2 No
label2 Shut up
label2 You're not safe
label2 Shut up
label2 Listen, I tried, Tyler
label2 I know you did
label2 There are things about you I like
label2 You're smart, funny
label2 You're spectacular in bed
label2 You have very serious emotional problems
label2 Deepseated problems for which you should seek professional help
label2 I know, and I'm sorry
label2 You're sorry, I'm sorry
label2 I can't
label2 And I won't
label2 I'm gone
label2 You can't leave, Marla
label2 You're not safe
label2 Marla, you don't understand
label2 Leave me alone
label2 Let go
label2 I don't ever wanna see you again
label2 That's fine..
label2 Here, wait right here
label2 Shut up
label2 Take this money and get on this bus
label2 I promise I won't bother you again
label2 Please get on the bus
label2 Please get on the bus
label2 They think you're a threat
label2 I can't explain it now, just trust me
label2 If I know where you are, you won't be safe
label2 I'll keep this, it's asshole tax
label2 Fine
label2 Remember, stay out of major cities
label2 You're the worst thing that ever happened to me
label2 Hello
label2 I need you to arrest me
label2 I am the leader of a terrorist organization  responsible for numerous acts of vandalism and assault all over this city
label2 In the metropolitan area, we had probably 200 members
label2 This is a tightlyregimented organization  with many cells capable of operating independent of central leadership
label2 Go to the house, OK
label2 That's our headquarters
label2 In the back, buried in the garden,  you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen
label2 In the basement, you're gonna find some bathtubs  that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin
label2 I believe the plan is to blow up  the headquarters of these credit card companies  and the TRW building
label2 Why these buildings
label2 Why credit card companies
label2 If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero
label2 Keep him talking
label2 I need to make a phone call
label2 I really admire what you're doing
label2 What
label2 You're a genius, sir
label2 You said if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem, even you,  we gotta get his balls
label2 Don't fight
label2 It will set an example
label2 You're making a big mistake
label2 You said you'd say that
label2 I'm not Tyler Durden
label2 You told us you'd say that too
label2 I am Tyler Durden
label2 Listen to me
label2 I'm giving you a direct order
label2 We're aborting this mission now
label2 Are you fucking out of your minds
label2 Is somebody timing this
label2 Keep your mouth shut
label2 Shit
label2 Some of this information checks out
label2 Be right there
label2 Hey, wait
label2 I got him
label2 Stop fighting
label2 Where's the rubber band
label2 Get away from me
label2 Drop that fucking knife
label2 Back up
label2 Get down on the floor
label2 The first person that comes out of this door  gets a lead salad
label2 Understand
label2 Get away
label2 <i>I ran.</i>  <i>I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>  <i>Then I ran some more.</i>  What the fuck are you doing
label2 Running around in your underpants
label2 You look crazy
label2 No
label2 I'm onto you
label2 I know what's going on here
label2 I got us a great place to watch from
label2 It'll be like payperview
label2 Oh, Christ
label2 Now what are you doing
label2 Why
label2 I can't let this happen
label2 There are 10 other bombs in 10 other buildings
label2 Since when is Project Mayhem about murder
label2 The buildings are empty
label2 We're not killing anyone
label2 We're setting 'em free
label2 Bob is dead
label2 They shot him in the head
label2 I'm not listening to you
label2 You're not even there
label2 I wouldn't do that
label2 Not unless you knew which wires were what
label2 <i>Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent all day thinking about the wrong ones.</i>  You think
label2 Oh, heavens, no
label2 Not the green one
label2 Pull any one but the green one
label2 I asked you not to do that
label2 Fuck
label2 Tyler, get away from the van
label2 Tyler, I'm not kidding
label2 OK.  You are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend  near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin
label2 Cool it, Tyler
label2 Come on
label2 Don't go
label2 What?
label2 Three minutes
label2 This is it
label2 Ground zero
label2 <i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>  Do you have a speech for the occasion
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I still can't think of anything
label2 Flashback humor
label2 Two and a half
label2 Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history
label2 One step closer to economic equilibrium
label2 Why is she here
label2 Tying up loose ends
label2 Put me down, you baldheaded fuck
label2 I beg you, please don't do this
label2 I'm not doing this
label2 This is what we want
label2 No.</i>   I don't want this
label2 Right
label2 We have to forget about you
label2 You're a voice in my head
label2 You're a voice in mine
label2 You need me
label2 No
label2 I don't
label2 You created me
label2 I didn't create some loser alter ego to make me feel better
label2 Take some responsibility
label2 I do
label2 So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off
label2 Have I ever let us down
label2 How far have you come because of me?
label2 I will bring us through this
label2 As always, I will carry you kicking and screaming  and in the end you will thank me
label2 Tyler
label2 I'm grateful to you
label2 For everything that you've done for me
label2 But this is too much
label2 I don't want this
label2 Your shitjob back
label2 Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms
label2 I won't do it
label2 This can't be happening
label2 It's already done, so shut up
label2 60 seconds till CRI
label2 I can figure this out
label2 This isn't even real
label2 You're not real, that gun... That gun isn't even in your hand
label2 Good for you
label2 It doesn't change a thing
label2 Why do you wanna put a gun to your head
label2 Not my head, Tyler
label2 Our head
label2 Interesting
label2 Where are you going with this, Ikea boy
label2 Hey
label2 Friends
label2 OK.  My eyes are open
label2 What's that smell
label2 Where is everybody
label2 Oh, no
label2 What's going on
label2 Mr Durden
label2 Are you... Are you all right, sir
label2 Oh, yeah, I'm OK.  You look terrible, sir
label2 What happened
label2 No, no, no, sir
label2 He's not kidding
label2 You need assistance
label2 I'm fine
label2 Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine
label2 Stop it
label2 Let her go
label2 Christ Almighty
label2 You
label2 Leave her with me
label2 Meet me downstairs
label2 Are you sure
label2 Yes, I'm sure
label2 What kind of sick fucking game are you playing at?
label2 Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face
label2 What happened
label2 Don't ask
label2 You're shot
label2 Yes, I'm shot
label2 Oh, my God
label2 One tough motherfucker
label2 Who did this
label2 I did, actually
label2 Find some gauze
label2 Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me
label2 I'm really OK.  Trust me
label2 Everything's gonna be fine
label2 You met me at a very strange time in my life
label2 I always think of her head
label2 I picture cracking her lovely skull...  Unspooling her brains..
label2 Trying to get answers
label2 The primal questions of any marriage
label2 "What are you thinking?
label2 "How are you feeling?
label2 The Irish prince graces us with his presence
label2 His majesty prefers not to be moistened
label2 I got you a present
label2 You loved it
label2 Thank you
label2 I'll add it to the collection
label2 Can you pour me a bourbon
label2 What's up, jitters
label2 Well, if you're not going to talk, I'm gonna have to fill the silence...  With another excruciating story by margo dunne
label2 I like that one
label2 Or how about the time I saw that woman who looked exactly like my friend Monica
label2 But it wasn't Monica
label2 It was a total stranger
label2 Who was also named Monica
label2 Made it kind of interesting
label2 I'm just having a bad day
label2 Amy
label2 Five years
label2 Five
label2 That came fast
label2 And furious
label2 I'm so crazy, stupid happy
label2 I met a boy
label2 A great, sweet, gorgeous, coolass guy
label2 I just want you to be careful...  Where you put down that monkbrewed Belgian wheat beer...  Because the party's down to three beast lights and a bottle of pucker
label2 It might attract some desperate characters
label2 I mean, the amish are on a rumspringa
label2 They already relieved me of my artisanal meat platter
label2 Finally, someone tells me how to pronounce that word
label2 "Meat"
label2 Yes, "meat.
label2 One syllable
label2 Whose beer am I about to drink
label2 Let's see, who's your type
label2 I don't see you sitting quietly..
label2 While he bloviates on his postgrad thesis about proust
label2 Uhoh
label2 Is that him
label2 Ironic hipster, so selfaware, he makes everything a joke
label2 What type are you
label2 Cornfed, saltoftheearth Missouri guy
label2 Missouri
label2 Cute
label2 Native new yorker
label2 What's your name
label2 Amy
label2 Well, Amy, who are you
label2 A, I'm an awardwinning scrimshander
label2 C, I write personality quizzes for magazines
label2 Okay
label2 So I'd recognize you
label2 I'm gonna go with "c."  And you
label2 Who are you
label2 So, you write for a men's magazine
label2 God, does that make you an expert on being a man
label2 No
label2 It's what to wear, what to drink
label2 How to bullshit
label2 Never with you
label2 Ha, ha
label2 It's hard to believe you
label2 Why
label2 I think it's your chin
label2 Yeah, it's quite villainous
label2 A hundred percent true, no bullshit
label2 Okay
label2 We all move to New York...  And we end up living in these little cubby holes, and that's not it
label2 Come outside
label2 Then, you're in it
label2 You have to see this
label2 Hey
label2 I have to kiss you now
label2 I can't let you go through a sugar storm unkissed
label2 Wait a second
label2 There you go
label2 Nick dunne..
label2 I really like you
label2 So, is Amy gonna do one of those anniversary...  Treasure hunts
label2 You mean the forced march designed to prove...  What an oblivious and uncaring asshole her husband is
label2 Life
label2 I don't remember the point
label2 Spin
label2 What was the clue last year she got so mad about
label2 "When your poor Amy has a cold...  "This dessert just must be sold.
label2 The answer
label2 I still don't know the answer, go
label2 A few years ago, you'd have known
label2 A few years ago, it was fun
label2 She got me a beautiful notebook
label2 Told me to go write my novel
label2 What did you get her
label2 A kite
label2 Okay
label2 Anyway
label2 She led me outside to the dying rosebush in the backyard
label2 That's symbolic
label2 Yeah
label2 Wood
label2 So, what did you get her
label2 There's no good gift for wood
label2 I know
label2 Go home, fuck her brains out, slap her with your penis
label2 The bar
label2 Why, yes
label2 Hang on one second
label2 Hey, it's watchful Wally
label2 Hey, Walt
label2 What's going on
label2 I'll be right there
label2 Hey, buddy
label2 What are you doing out here
label2 Thanks, Walt
label2 Amy
label2 Hello
label2 Come on in
label2 Hey
label2 Mister dunne
label2 Hi
label2 I'm detective Rhonda boney
label2 This is officer James gilpin
label2 I don't know where my wife is
label2 And I came home to this
label2 Now, I don't panic easily..
label2 But it's weird, right
label2 How long have you two been here
label2 Two years in September
label2 We used to live in New York
label2 City
label2 Yeah, I was a writer
label2 Why did you all move back here
label2 My mom got sick
label2 Oh, I'm sorry
label2 How is she
label2 She's dead
label2 What do you do now, for work
label2 My sister margo and I own the bar downtown
label2 Love the name
label2 Very meta
label2 Thanks
label2 Pretty things
label2 Stay
label2 My office, here
label2 Beautiful dress
label2 It's our anniversary
label2 It's a guest bedroom, there
label2 Cat's room on the end
label2 I checked up here
label2 This is my wife's office
label2 Amy's office
label2 Impressive gal
label2 Yeah
label2 Should I be concerned
label2 I remember these
label2 I loved these books
label2 Wait a minute
label2 Yeah
label2 She is
label2 Wow
label2 AmazingfuckingAmy is getting fucking married
label2 With me, regular, flawed, real Amy, jealous, as always, of the golden child
label2 Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy, who's getting fucking married
label2 In the next book, amazing Amy became a prodigy
label2 Did you play volleyball
label2 I got cut, freshman year
label2 When did you have a dog
label2 She got the dog
label2 Puddles made her more relatable
label2 Wow
label2 I love your parents..
label2 But they really can be assholes
label2 Nick
label2 Hey, thanks for coming, man
label2 No problem
label2 Hey, sweetheart
label2 Big night for your mom
label2 People wanna hear from you
label2 We can't stay long
label2 Fifteen minutes, tops
label2 This is why I have my brownstone
label2 My trust fund
label2 I know I can't complain
label2 Your parents literally plagiarized your childhood
label2 No, they improved upon it, and then peddled it to the masses
label2 I thought you were gonna wear white to match the wedding theme
label2 "If it's worth doing, it's worth doing..."  hold up
label2 I know how this ends
label2 Don't tell me
label2 Amy, you know what would make dad's night
label2 I'm on it
label2 I love having strangers pick at my scabs
label2 I'm curious whether..
label2 It's difficult for you to see amazing Amy heading down the aisle
label2 Is that correct
label2 Correct
label2 Amazing Amy has always been one step ahead of me
label2 Excuse me
label2 I'm sorry, I just have a few questions
label2 It's you
label2 I'm here in a strictly journalistic capacity
label2 Two magical years
label2 Two magical years
label2 In the course of that time, you've had the opportunity...  To perform such gracious gestures as...  Not correcting Nick when he pronounced "quinoa" as "kweenoa.
label2 He also thought it was a fish
label2 He thinks velveeta is a cheese
label2 You also manage to appear shocked and delighted..
label2 that's just frightening
label2 You also bought Nick his very first pair of scissors
label2 And matching stapler
label2 Amy elliott, you are more than amazing
label2 You challenge me
label2 You surprise me
label2 And, fun fact for the readers...  You have a worldclass vagina
label2 My colleagues tell me that you are not yet married
label2 Is that correct
label2 I'm not
label2 And then..
label2 The night wasn't so bad anymore
label2 And it's done
label2 Crossed off the list
label2 Now, normally, we would not treat this as a missing persons case so quick..
label2 Good
label2 We've got forensics over at your place
label2 You got somewhere to stay
label2 I could stay at my sister's
label2 We're tracking Amy's phone, her credit cards
label2 We will organize searches, put up flyers
label2 We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow
label2 You're having a press conference
label2 I wanna get the word out, right
label2 Time is of the essence in these cases
label2 But, that said, do you wanna wait and call a lawyer
label2 Absolutely not
label2 So, you and Amy have been here two years
label2 You tend bar..
label2 I own the bar
label2 And I teach creative writing at mvcc
label2 No kids
label2 Not yet
label2 A woman with all those degrees, what does she do
label2 I don't know
label2 She keeps busy
label2 She's a voracious reader
label2 So, she's always got a book in her hand
label2 Well, days can get long
label2 Or prescription pills
label2 Just last week, we had a soccer mom
label2 Nice lady
label2 Got her teeth kicked in over some oxycontin
label2 Ever since that mall went bust, half the town is out of work
label2 We cannot keep up with the drug violence
label2 I'm pretty sure that's not it
label2 No, not really
label2 No friends
label2 This whole town
label2 She was very close with my mom, before she passed away
label2 In our neighborhood
label2 I think maybe you guys should check that out
label2 We'll look into that
label2 Where were you before that
label2 Just to cross that out
label2 Well, I was home
label2 I left at 9:30, I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper
label2 Did you visit with anyone there
label2 I kind of go to Sawyer beach for the solitude
label2 So, your wife has no friends here
label2 Is she kinda standoffish
label2 Rubs people the wrong way
label2 She's from New York
label2 She's got very high standards
label2 Type a
label2 That can make you crazy if you're not like that
label2 You seem pretty laidback
label2 Type b
label2 God, I don't know
label2 I'd have to look it up at the house
label2 You don't know if she has friends, you don't know what she does all day...  And you don't know your wife's blood type
label2 Sure you all are married
label2 Maybe it's type o
label2 Where are her folks
label2 Yeah
label2 Can they get here time for this press conference tomorrow
label2 Tomorrow
label2 I have no idea
label2 I haven't talked to them
label2 You can't get a signal in this building
label2 Call them, please, Nick
label2 Now
label2 Fine
label2 No
label2 I apologize, marybeth
label2 I didn't know what was going on
label2 Now I'm at the station...  And the cops are at the house, and it's serious and I'm calling you
label2 There's a lot of things that are being juggled right now
label2 I'm standing right next to detective Rhonda boney...  Who's the lead investigator on this and she's...  My motherinlaw would like to speak with you
label2 I wanna go home
label2 I don't know why I have to be here
label2 I don't wanna be here
label2 I wanna go home
label2 Dad
label2 What's going on
label2 Really
label2 You're Nick dunne
label2 We've been trying to get a hold of you all afternoon
label2 My wife is missing
label2 Bitch
label2 Your father wandered out of comfort hill after lunch
label2 We found him walking route 79, disoriented
label2 We've been trying to call you for the last..
label2 I don't get a cell signal in this building
label2 I've been sitting 20 feet away from you
label2 Sir, please don't take that tone with me
label2 Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch
label2 You wanna drive him home
label2 Thanks
label2 This voice mailbox is currently full
label2 Fuck
label2 Get your fucking hands off me
label2 Thanks
label2 Marriage is hard work
label2 And compromise and more work
label2 "Abandon all hope, ye who enter.
label2 "When young Amy's hope did wane...  "She wandered here..."  Well, it's not true
label2 "...In search of Jane.
label2 With us, two years..
label2 It's just good
label2 You were an alienated teen and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you
label2 Look at that
label2 My God
label2 You naughty minx
label2 Well, technically, we are supposed to fuck at the next stop
label2 Yeah, in keeping with tradition
label2 But I might be willing to bend the rules this once
label2 I'm enthusiastic
label2 Look at that
label2 It's confirmed by the..
label2 Year two
label2 Cotton
label2 We had that joke that our sex was too good for ordinary
label2 I wanna punch us in the face
label2 That's pretty great
label2 I mean, that is pretty great
label2 Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer
label2 I don't need a lawyer
label2 Well, did they ask personal stuff about Amy
label2 You know, they asked...  Why didn't she have any friends
label2 I said she was complicated
label2 Nick
label2 Everyone knows "complicated" is code for "bitch.
label2 God
label2 Thanks
label2 It's so bizarre
label2 It seems like the kind of thing that would happen to Amy
label2 She always attracts...  drama
label2 It's just me and you
label2 Just because I don't like to be around Amy..
label2 Doesn't mean I don't care about her
label2 Anyway, whoever took her is bound to bring her back
label2 Detective
label2 Excuse me
label2 I'm Amy's best friend
label2 Well, great
label2 Where do you live, noelle

label2 Wonderful
label2 Can I come by in half an hour
label2 Y'all know anything yet
label2 I'm sorry

label2 But that's usually bath time
label2 Well, we'll talk in between shampoos
label2 All right
label2 So, what do you got
label2 Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep
label2 Not that weird, but that is awfully high
label2 So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep

label2 Interesting

label2 Car's in her name
label2 Credit cards, utilities, phone bill, all in her name
label2 Even his bar's in her name
label2 I don't know that that's so surprising
label2 No
label2 What you got
label2 It's with her unmentionables
label2 Well, we have our first clue
label2 I have to take a shower
label2 No, don't
label2 You wanna look like you've been up all night
label2 That's a weird thing to say
label2 Well, when you're upset, you bottle up
label2 You can seem angry, like...  please don't say, "like dad.
label2 Or else you swing into your momma'sboy charm offensive and that can feel glib
label2 Perfect

label2 Mr. elliott
label2 Mr. dunne, any signs of foul play
label2 Smile
label2 That's all for now
label2 Amy is the kind of girl who attracts admirers
label2 Right, Nick
label2 Yeah, definitely
label2 And we've had instances...   Where things got..
label2 Scary
label2 Yeah, I know all about desi collings
label2 He was obsessed
label2 He attempted suicide after Amy broke up with him sophomore year
label2 We had to file a restraining order
label2 This would be high school
label2 But he recently moved to St. Louis
label2 That's just two hours away
label2 To be fair, he is from St. Louis
label2 We also have Tommy O'Hara
label2 This is only eight years ago, in New York
label2 She broke up with him, he got very physical
label2 What was the charge
label2 Sexual assault, threat, battery, what
label2 I didn't know this
label2 Okay
label2 Thank you
label2 Anything more recent
label2 Not that I know of
label2 Hey, Nick
label2 Yeah
label2 A missing persons case...  And in your wife's dressing room, we find an envelope marked "clue.
label2 That's for our anniversary
label2 My wife does these treasure hunts
label2 I'm hoping you can tell me what this means
label2 You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt
label2 It'll help me track Amy's movements before she disappeared
label2 Of course
label2 "Although this spot couldn't be tighter...  "It's a cozy room for my favorite writer.
label2 I know this one
label2 Although this spot couldn't be any tighter..
label2 It's a cozy room for my favorite writer
label2 Well, well
label2 What does it say
label2 Clue two
label2 "Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover
label2 "You'll be the spy, and I'll be his lover
label2 "Let's head on over...  "To the little brown house
label2 These yours
label2 No
label2 But you read the first clue
label2 Randy Professor, naughty student
label2 Me and my ex just swapped cards
label2 Where's this little brown house
label2 I have no idea
label2 Hello
label2 Nicholas dunne
label2 Under my father's name, William dunne
label2 Is this necessary
label2 Can you just turn the bell...  yeah, I know
label2 It's "puddles," right
label2 Or is it "poodles?
label2 We're good
label2 Hello, stranger
label2 Fancy meeting you here
label2 It's your dad's house, right
label2 Like you said, it's my dad's house
label2 I come by once a week, make sure the place hasn't burned down
label2 But it looks okay
label2 I'll walk you out
label2 You know..
label2 I thought maybe this was the little brown house
label2 Nope
label2 Still blue
label2 Picture me, I'm a girl who's very, very bad
label2 I need to be punished, and by "punished," I mean "had.
label2 It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five
label2 Bitch
label2 Want to test your marriage for weak spots
label2 Add one recession...  Subtract two jobs
label2 It's surprisingly effective
label2 Promise me we'll never be like them
label2 Those wives who treat their men like dancing monkeys...  To be trained and paraded
label2 Husbands who treat their wives like the highway patrol...  To be outfoxed and avoided
label2 I think I'm gonna be laid off
label2 We're in a recession
label2 If it happens, we'll deal with it
label2 I'll probably be next
label2 We have each other
label2 You are exceptional
label2 My parents' publisher dropped them, and they're in debt up to their ears
label2 That's terrible
label2 And they need to borrow from my trust fund
label2 How much
label2 Almost a million
label2 That's almost all of it
label2 This is where you say, "everything else is background noise.
label2 I said I'd do it
label2 Without talking to me
label2 Well, it's..
label2 Your call
label2 You know what
label2 You're right
label2 Everything else is just background noise
label2 Hey
label2 Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks
label2 What's the laptop for
label2 I see
label2 You can give your parents $879,000 without talking to me..
label2 But God forbid I buy a video game without getting your permission
label2 You are spending a lot
label2 You don't trust me
label2 You don't trust my judgment
label2 You certainly don't trust my intention
label2 That's the basic tenet of a prenup, isn't it
label2 Because it's easy to throw
label2 Nick, I don't get it
label2 I don't get why you're daring me to be someone I don't wanna be
label2 The nagging shrew
label2 The controlling bitch
label2 I'm your wife
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I just don't know how to do this
label2 I flipped burgers, I painted houses
label2 You'll get another job
label2 Hi, go
label2 What
label2 What
label2 And suddenly..
label2 Slow down, what is it
label2 I knew everything was about to get worse
label2 Okay, tell me what's wrong
label2 Bless you, Nick
label2 Hey, tom
label2 Mayor
label2 Nick, good to see you
label2 Good to see you
label2 Hey, guys, hey
label2 Nick
label2 Oh, we'll find her
label2 Thank you
label2 You ever see that guy in the glasses before
label2 We videotape everybody that comes in and out of these things
label2 I mean, you tend to get a lot of...  Dogooders
label2 Freaks
label2 Hey, I meant to ask you
label2 Noelle hawthorne
label2 She lives on your street
label2 Amy's best friend
label2 She and her husband have triplets
label2 Oh
label2 But "best friend"
label2 No
label2 Excuse me, one sec
label2 Of course he did
label2 Look, these two are yours
label2 Oh, look
label2 He's being a good guy..
label2 So everybody can see him being a good guy
label2 You really don't like him, do you
label2 This mailbox is currently full
label2 Press one to...  Nick
label2 My name's shawna Kelly
label2 I am so sorry for your troubles
label2 Thank you
label2 That's kind
label2 Are you remembering to eat
label2 Well, a lot of cold cuts
label2 That's very kind and very unnecessary
label2 You have to keep your strength
label2 Would you...  Say, "chicken frito pie!
label2 You know what
label2 Would you delete that picture for me
label2 I know it is
label2 But just do me a favor
label2 Will you
label2 Would you go ahead and please delete that picture
label2 You just press...  What is wrong with you
label2 I will share it with whomever I please
label2 Dude
label2 Yeah
label2 Why
label2 Marybeth
label2 It was important to my mother that I be polite..
label2 I be considerate, I be a gentleman
label2 It looked like you were having fun
label2 I am in a nightmare
label2 All I'm trying to do is be nice...  To the people who are volunteering to help find Amy
label2 And I'm sorry
label2 My God, this place literally smells like feces
label2 In your searches, did you find any golf clubs, real fancy
label2 No
label2 How about a brand new stratocaster
label2 Well, all right
label2 How big's that TV
label2 No, it's nowhere near that
label2 Okay
label2 Kibble
label2 He asked me to feed his cat
label2 I saw some in the pantry
label2 Detective boney, officer gilpin
label2 Noelle hawthorne
label2 I know y'all are in there
label2 Detective boney
label2 Just remind her it is a possible crime scene
label2 Look at that pieeating grin, from a guy whose wife is missing
label2 Terrific
label2 How's marybeth
label2 She's a wreck
label2 And you
label2 Awesome
label2 Hey...  Have you told me everything
label2 Of course
label2 Everything
label2 I am off
label2 Everybody's examining me and projecting their shit on me
label2 All I want is to come over here, have a beer with you...  And not be judged
label2 Can we do that
label2 Of course
label2 You know what I keep thinking
label2 If mom were here
label2 Like I'm 12
label2 Nick, mom would fix it
label2 Love you
label2 Love you
label2 So, here's a strange, new sentence
label2 I am a missourian
label2 Bye, dad
label2 No money, no jobs, no prospects
label2 Mama Maureen..
label2 So, we moved to Missouri
label2 I don't mind
label2 I just wish he'd asked
label2 Nick is happy to be home
label2 But I don't know if he's happy I'm with him
label2 I feel like something he loaded by mistake
label2 Something disposable
label2 I feel like I could disappear
label2 Oh, my God
label2 I saw you on TV
label2 Okay
label2 It's so crazy
label2 She just vanished
label2 She's just gone
label2 I've been so worried about you
label2 Where have you been
label2 You gotta pick up your phone
label2 What
label2 Godspell
label2 My sister's asleep in the other room
label2 I needed to see you
label2 Can you at least tell me you love me
label2 I do love you, but we have to be really careful right now
label2 I've been so scared
label2 Between rehearsals
label2 You told me I needed to have my own life
label2 I know
label2 I need you
label2 Touch me
label2 Come here
label2 Sit down
label2 Okay
label2 Did you, by any chance, tell anybody anything about us
label2 Even in texting, or on Facebook
label2 Facebook
label2 You buy my presents in cash
label2 I'm not stupid, Nick
label2 I know, sweetie
label2 Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office
label2 I don't know
label2 They better be mine
label2 Sweetheart, think
label2 I don't know
label2 Andie, I need you to take this seriously, okay
label2 This is the last time we're gonna see each other, until...  Until when
label2 Until it's safe
label2 You were going to get a divorce
label2 Okay
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I don't wanna fight
label2 Andie, please...  That's all I want
label2 I can't
label2 It's our last time together
label2 Let's make the most of it
label2 Real quick, but then you have to go
label2 My husband has come undone
label2 But as it turns out, we couldn't
label2 It means a lot that you came
label2 We took a hit on the brownstone...  And I used the last of my trust fund to buy him a bar
label2 Nick uses me for sex when he wants
label2 We should go to outback tonight
label2 That would be nice
label2 Last night, I went from desperate to pathetic
label2 I became someone I don't even like
label2 The kind of woman I used to mock
label2 You're out so much
label2 I know
label2 Stay home
label2 Then, can I come
label2 You would hate it
label2 It's a bunch of my dorky high school friends
label2 No bullshit
label2 I thought we weren't gonna be that couple
label2 Hey, I've been thinking
label2 Yeah
label2 Something positive
label2 Maybe it's time
label2 Now is literally the worst time
label2 And for me, I would have a real purpose here
label2 A child is not a hobby
label2 Not a hobby
label2 An inspiration
label2 I'm late
label2 I didn't know it was gonna be a fight
label2 You really wanna be the couple that has a baby to save their marriage
label2 Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever
label2 And you're gonna walk out the door now
label2 Yeah
label2 You're a fucking coward
label2 Really
label2 I won't
label2 You won't
label2 Why, it's not good enough for you
label2 It's not even close
label2 You stupid bitch
label2 What scared me wasn't that he'd pushed me
label2 What scared me was that I'd finally realized..
label2 I am frightened of my own husband
label2 You want me to call for backup
label2 Nah, I'll protect you
label2 Jesus
label2 They ought to burn this place down
label2 Seems like folks are trying
label2 You really think this is anything
label2 Hey, Jason
label2 What's up, Rhonda
label2 "...and dedicated to the proposition that all men..."   Have you seen this girl around here
label2 She was reported missing
label2 "...and so dedicated, can long endure.
label2 Yeah
label2 I remember her
label2 What did she want
label2 She wanted a gun
label2 I felt bad, though
label2 She seemed really desperate
label2 She said it needed to be small, so she could keep it close
label2 You don't forget a girl like that in here
label2 She was all in pink
label2 It was Valentine's day
label2 For Valentine's day, I thought I'd buy a gun
label2 Nick wants me gone but he won't ask for a divorce
label2 In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar, his only line of credit
label2 The bitch with the prenup
label2 I could go home to my parents..
label2 And I don't even know if I believe the truth
label2 Can I really think Nick would hurt me
label2 I'm being paranoid
label2 Crazy
label2 It's just..
label2 I'd sleep better with a gun
label2 Wake up, baby
label2 My sister's gonna come out here
label2 Sorry to rush you
label2 It's okay
label2 Here
label2 Let me help you
label2 Be very careful
label2 I'm all right
label2 Here you go
label2 Promise me we'll talk every day
label2 Okay, we will
label2 Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy
label2 Don't go crazy
label2 You fucking idiot
label2 You fucking asshole
label2 You fucking lied to my fucking face
label2 I'm sorry
label2 She's in her early 20s
label2 A year and a half
label2 You lied to me for over a year
label2 If I told you, you would have made me stop
label2 It's so fucking small
label2 You're a liar and a cheat
label2 How did you even meet her
label2 She's one of my students
label2 I thought writers hated clichÃ©s
label2 I'm not a writer
label2 "Boohoo, I got laid off
label2 I guess I'll fuck a teenager.
label2 You have no idea how shitty it was with Amy...  How fucking terrible she made me feel
label2 I would get knots in my stomach...  Just coming home, knowing she would be sitting there..
label2 Dissatisfied, before I even walked in the fucking door
label2 This is so bad
label2 If anybody finds out, you're totally fucked
label2 Boney found a pair of panties in my office...  Where, occasionally, Andie and I..
label2 I don't know what the fuck it means
label2 Are they supertwat's
label2 Her name is Andie
label2 So we are dealing with a 20yearold...  Who isn't sure where she leaves her undies
label2 If they're not Andie's, that means that they're Amy's...  And she left them there for me to find
label2 Nick, I was scared for you before, and now, I'm fucking petrified
label2 We're having a vigil tonight for your missing wife...  And this morning, you're kissing your college girlfriend goodbye
label2 Have you watched television lately
label2 Cable news is all over your shit
label2 His wife's nowhere to be found...  And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting
label2 Cute pic, huh
label2 Who is that
label2 Who the fuck is that
label2 I don't know
label2 She was trying to give me a casserole
label2 On the show today we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...  Patron Saint to wifekillers everywhere
label2 Tanner bolt, would you actually consider defending Nick dunne
label2 Well, let me just say...  As always, Ellen, thank you for such a warm welcome
label2 But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne
label2 But the truth is, you'd have to be a sociopath...  To behave normally in this situation...  Because it's the most abnormal situation in the world
label2 Tanner, are you trying to tell me that this photo...  Is remotely in the realm of acceptable behavior
label2 I'm so sick of being picked apart by women
label2 You need to hire Tanner bolt
label2 Innocent until proven guilty
label2 That's exactly what you deserve
label2 Go home, Nick
label2 Hey, buddy
label2 I can't believe we haven't arrested this guy
label2 We're not gonna arrest anybody...  Just because some blonde dunce says so
label2 Why are you going so easy on him
label2 One, I am conducting an investigation, not a witchhunt
label2 She was trying to buy a gun
label2 We don't know who or what was scaring her, gil
label2 Give me the update
label2 No drug angles panned out yet, so cross that off the list
label2 I talked to the nurses who care for Nick's father
label2 The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten, so cross that off the list
label2 Hey
label2 Hey
label2 Whoa
label2 Yeah
label2 The blood is profuse
label2 Thoughts on a weapon
label2 Maybe a club or a twobyfour
label2 She fell there, but I doubt she got back up
label2 Amy's medical records come in
label2 No, we'll have them later tonight
label2 My wife says he's a killer
label2 Well, if Tiffany says...  Hey
label2 Hey
label2 Thank you all for coming out
label2 Rich, thank you so much
label2 Thank you, folks
label2 Thank you for being here tonight
label2 It just means the world to our family
label2 And to Amy
label2 As you all know...  My wife, Amy elliott dunne..
label2 And I want to implore anyone who has any information at all..
label2 Please come forward
label2 Help us
label2 So hot
label2 I wanna say something, because I think some of you might be wondering...  And are too polite to ask
label2 I had nothing to do with the disappearance of my wife
label2 I'm cooperating with the police
label2 I haven't hired a lawyer
label2 I have nothing to hide
label2 Amy is my soul mate
label2 Asshole
label2 I love my wife..
label2 So much
label2 And I may not behave for the cameras the way they want me to...  And if they wanna punish me for that, that's okay
label2 But I just wanna ask you in the media, please, harass me..
label2 But don't harass the people of this town
label2 Nick
label2 But please don't turn this investigation into a circus
label2 Where's your wife, Nick
label2 What did you do to your pregnant wife
label2 Did you tell them that, Nick
label2 Did you tell them Amy was six weeks pregnant
label2 Thank you for your support tonight
label2 Go ahead, if you guys wanna say something
label2 Gil, go, go
label2 Nick, where are you going
label2 No questions right now
label2 Thank you
label2 Why are you running away
label2 Don't run
label2 Everybody, stay back
label2 You know better
label2 Get off the grass, get down to the curb
label2 Hey, gil...  On it
label2 All right, y'all heard her
label2 No pictures
label2 Hello
label2 Hello
label2 Fuck
label2 You scared me
label2 Want a drink
label2 I told you, noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy
label2 She doesn't even know Amy
label2 They look like pretty good friends to me
label2 Look, I don't know
label2 We have her medical records coming
label2 Good
label2 So, let's talk while we wait
label2 Let's start over here
label2 The scene of the crime
label2 Dozens and dozens
label2 This area right here, it looked wrong from the second we saw it
label2 The whole thing looked staged
label2 And yet, they remained upright throughout this lifeanddeath struggle
label2 I don't know
label2 What do you want me to say
label2 Did you do any housekeeping the day your wife went missing
label2 Because our guys did a luminol test
label2 And I'm sorry to tell you, but that kitchen lit up
label2 Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick
label2 Oh, my God
label2 Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up
label2 Wait a second
label2 Why would they mop up the blood..
label2 If they're trying to stage a crime scene
label2 It tells us, look at people outside the house
label2 Like these homeless you keep mentioning
label2 A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide
label2 It tells us to look at people inside the house
label2 I see
label2 So, how was your marriage, Nick
label2 Because right now, all we got is noelle
label2 She says, "not good.
label2 What pisses you off
label2 Me and my ex, it's the same
label2 I mention that because we got a look at your finances, Nick
label2 $117,000 in credit card debt
label2 What
label2 I pulled up some of the merchandise
label2 There are these fun little splurges
label2 I didn't buy any of this stuff
label2 I do
label2 You bought great clubs
label2 I like the robot dog
label2 This is identity theft
label2 This is a felony
label2 All right
label2 Let's talk about life insurance
label2 Because in April, you bumped up Amy's life insurance...  To $1.2 million
label2 That was her idea
label2 She wanted me to
label2 You filed the paperwork
label2 Because she told me to
label2 Yeah
label2 Okay
label2 All right
label2 She was pregnant
label2 This is insane
label2 I don't want to talk to you again, ever..
label2 Without a lawyer
label2 Margo
label2 Hey
label2 Just hold on a second
label2 Nick
label2 I hear you, I hear you
label2 I was as surprised as..
label2 I know you're upset
label2 I had no idea she was pregnant
label2 Listen, I thought so, too, but evidently that wasn't...  you want to know the truth
label2 Well, I'm as surprised as...  you told me you didn't want kids
label2 Then, suddenly, you've got a pregnant wife
label2 That's a problem for you
label2 Especially when you factor in the secret teenage girlfriend
label2 Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott
label2 I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids because she didn't want me to
label2 Because it would have just been another reason for you to hate her
label2 And we had enough of those already
label2 It was easier to just...   lie to me
label2 I wanted kids
label2 When we first moved here, I went to a fertility clinic
label2 It didn't work
label2 I did my part
label2 When it came time for Amy to do her thing, all of a sudden it was like...  "Well, I don't know
label2 Maybe
label2 No, thanks.
label2 Now, who would believe you
label2 This is a letter from the clinic...  Notifying me that they're gonna destroy my sample..
label2 Unless I contact them
label2 So, I gave it to Amy
label2 The next day, I saw it in the trash
label2 I wanted a baby with Amy
label2 "When your poor Amy has a cold, this dessert just..."  this is the clue you couldn't solve
label2 Yeah
label2 A letter from desi
label2 That creepy boyfriend of Amy's
label2 It was the fucking rich guy who would do anything for her
label2 It just kept hanging over my head
label2 Your prenup
label2 Nick, why have you kept this stuff
label2 It's like a little box of hate
label2 I don't know, go
label2 I love you no matter what
label2 But you need to tell me
label2 What are you asking me
label2 Are you asking me if I killed my wife, go
label2 Is that what you're asking me
label2 If I murdered my wife
label2 Margo
label2 Don't walk on the glass
label2 You have no clue, do you
label2 Why was he here that night
label2 His wife is missing
label2 Who cares
label2 Rhonda, we got this
label2 Let's make the arrest
label2 Do you know how hard it is to make a murder case without a body
label2 No
label2 So, I want one last thing
label2 What's that
label2 I want a body
label2 I'm a girl who's very, very bad
label2 Be careful
label2 I need to be punished, and by "punished," I mean "had.
label2 Fuck
label2 It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five
label2 So, open the door...  Punish
label2 Beach
label2 And look alive
label2 Wood
label2 Wood
label2 I will practice believing my husband loves me...  And will love this baby
label2 That this child might really save our marriage
label2 But I could be wrong
label2 The way he looks at me..
label2 This man of mine may kill me
label2 He may truly..
label2 Kill me
label2 Wtf
label2 I am so much happier now that I'm dead
label2 Technically, "missing.
label2 Gone
label2 And my lazy, lying, cheating, oblivious husband...  Will go to prison for my murder
label2 Nick dunne took my pride and my dignity...  And my hope and my money
label2 He took and took from me until I no longer existed
label2 Let the punishment fit the crime
label2 To fake a convincing murder, you have to have discipline
label2 Harvest the details of her humdrum life
label2 And cram her with stories about your husband's violent temper
label2 Secretly create some money troubles
label2 Credit cards, perhaps online gambling
label2 With the help of the unwitting...  Bump up your life insurance
label2 Purchase getaway car
label2 Generic
label2 Cheap
label2 Pay cash
label2 You need to package yourself so that people will truly mourn your loss
label2 And America loves pregnant women
label2 You know what's hard
label2 Faking a pregnancy
label2 First, drain your toilet
label2 Invite pregnant idiot into your home...  And ply her with lemonade
label2 Steal pregnant idiot's urine
label2 A pregnancy is now part of your legal medical record
label2 Happy anniversary
label2 Off he goes
label2 And the clock is ticking
label2 Meticulously stage your crime scene...  With just enough mistakes to raise the specter of doubt
label2 You need to bleed
label2 A lot
label2 A head wound kind of bleed
label2 A crime scene kind of bleed
label2 You need to clean poorly...  Like he would
label2 Clean and bleed
label2 Bleed and clean
label2 And because you're you...  You don't stop there
label2 You need a diary
label2 Minimum, 300 entries on the Nick and Amy story
label2 Start with the fairy tale early days
label2 Those are true
label2 And they're crucial
label2 You want Nick and Amy to be likeable
label2 The spending
label2 The abuse
label2 The fear
label2 The threat of violence
label2 Burn it just the right amount
label2 Make sure the cops will find it
label2 Finally, honor tradition with a very special treasure hunt
label2 And if I get everything right, the world will hate Nick...  For killing his beautiful, pregnant wife
label2 And after all the outrage, when I'm ready..
label2 And when they find my body, they'll know...  Nick dunne dumped his beloved like garbage
label2 And she floated down past all the other..
label2 Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women
label2 Then, Nick will die, too
label2 But, then, we never really existed
label2 Nick loved a girl I was pretending to be
label2 Men always use that as their defining compliment
label2 "She's a cool girl.
label2 Cool girl is hot
label2 Cool girl is fun
label2 Cool girl never gets angry at her man
label2 She only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner...  And then presents her mouth for fucking
label2 So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster who loves fetish manga
label2 If he likes girls gone wild, she's a mall babe...  Who talks football and endures buffalo wings at Hooters
label2 When I met Nick dunne, I knew he wanted cool girl
label2 And for him, I'll admit, I was willing to try
label2 I waxstripped my pussy raw
label2 I drank canned beer watching Adam sandier movies
label2 I blew him semiregularly
label2 I lived in the moment
label2 I was fucking game
label2 I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it
label2 Nick teased out of me things I didn't know existed
label2 A lightness, a humor, an ease
label2 Sharper
label2 I inspired him to rise to my level
label2 I forged the man of my dreams
label2 We were happy pretending to be other people
label2 And what's the point of being together if you're not the happiest
label2 But Nick got lazy
label2 He became someone I did not agree to marry
label2 Then he dragged me, penniless, to the navel of this great country...  And found himself a newer, younger, bouncier..
label2 Cool girl
label2 You think I'd let him destroy me and end up happier than ever
label2 No fucking way
label2 My cute, charming, saltoftheearth, Missouri guy
label2 He needed to learn
label2 Grownups pay
label2 Grownups suffer consequences
label2 Wait
label2 I need 20 seconds where you don't judge me, interrupt me...  Or get angry
label2 Okay
label2 Where do you store goodies for anniversary five
label2 Wood
label2 Woodshed
label2 That fucking bitch
label2 I thought..
label2 It's all right
label2 I would have, too
label2 What's that present
label2 I don't know
label2 "Dear husband, I know you think you're moving through this world unseen
label2 "Don't believe that for a second
label2 "I know where you've been, and I know where you're going.
label2 "For this anniversary, I've arranged a trip
label2 "Follow the river, up, up, up
label2 What's "up, up river"
label2 "Up the river.
label2 Prison
label2 That's what this is
label2 She's framing me for her murder
label2 You married a complete psychopath
label2 The morning of our anniversary..
label2 I just couldn't do it
label2 I couldn't fake it for another year, another day
label2 Then what happened
label2 Before I could say anything, she said...  "I need you to go somewhere and really think about our marriage.
label2 So you'd have no alibi
label2 She stagemanaged me
label2 And I fucking did it
label2 I went to the beach, I thought about our marriage
label2 I came back and decided I wanted a divorce
label2 You fuck
label2 She's good
label2 Part of me was relieved..
label2 When I thought she was gone
label2 Punch and Judy puppets
label2 So I'm punch
label2 We already knew that, Amy, what's your point
label2 Does Missouri have the death penalty
label2 It's been weeks since I had anyone decent next door
label2 Well, I don't know how decent I feel
label2 As long as you don't own a python and blast death metal at 4 am...  We're gonna be best friends
label2 All right
label2 I'm greta
label2 I'm Nancy
label2 Are you going to the marina
label2 I could use some creamer
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I can't
label2 I've got work to do
label2 See you around
label2 You will
label2 Come on
label2 Show me that darling Nicky smile
label2 Hey
label2 Nancy
label2 Nancy
label2 It's hot again today
label2 Let me guess
label2 Nebraska
label2 New Orleans
label2 Oh, I just bet you are
label2 Lotions and balms
label2 Ointment
label2 So sweet
label2 Okay
label2 You know where I'll be
label2 I see we have the same taste in men
label2 Least you could do is not keep his secrets for him
label2 Let me guess
label2 He's trying to watch the big game and you just won't shut up
label2 No, you don't seem like much of a talker
label2 You caught your boy rubbing up on some hot little skank...  And he apologized to you by busting you a good one
label2 Worse
label2 Worse
label2 I went to the bar where he works to surprise him
label2 And out he comes with this girl who had no business being in a bar
label2 On the very first night that we met...  We walked by a bakery that was having their sugar delivered
label2 A sugar storm
label2 And before he kissed me..
label2 He leaned in...  And did this
label2 What
label2 He did the exact same thing with her
label2 Thank you
label2 Thanks very much
label2 Well, we've gone mainstream
label2 It's an appeals process, so we will attempt to appeal to them
label2 Mr. bolt
label2 Tanner bolt
label2 Nick dunne
label2 I have been sitting by the phone, my friend
label2 Do you not believe me
label2 No, I believe you
label2 It's just the craziest thing I've ever heard
label2 But, for you, it sucks
label2 But you gotta have a grudging respect for your wife at this point, right
label2 Are you laughing me out of the building
label2 No
label2 Are you kidding me
label2 I'm way in
label2 You came to the right guy
label2 This is what I do, Nick
label2 This is why I have a $100,000 retainer
label2 $100,000
label2 We'll figure something out
label2 Okay
label2 So, what's the plan
label2 Well, right now, it's a "he said, she said.
label2 No, Nick
label2 She is telling the perfect story
label2 So, we need to start today to prepare your defense, should we need it
label2 And if we decide to go with your version of...  the truth
label2 Then we'll need to realign the public's perception of Amy
label2 Make them stop seeing her as America's sweetheart...  And see her for what she is, which a mindfucker of the first degree
label2 Now, that is a huge realignment
label2 There has to be someone out there that she's screwed with in the past
label2 There's a New York guy
label2 O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara
label2 That should be easy to find
label2 She said that he stalked her
label2 He's in St. Louis
label2 You go talk to Tommy, and I'll draw up the contract
label2 I told you, you came to the right guy
label2 Tommy
label2 Yeah
label2 Thanks for seeing me
label2 Yeah, yeah, yeah
label2 Yeah
label2 So, she said you got physical with her
label2 No, dude, she said I raped her
label2 First degree, felony rape
label2 Did you do it
label2 Did you do it
label2 I was looking at 30 years to life
label2 Did you get a trial
label2 Do I look like I would do well in the yard
label2 I pled down, man
label2 Sexual assault one, no jail time
label2 That's something
label2 I've been unemployed for the last eight years...  Because I have to write "sexual offender" on every job application
label2 I'm on a neighborhood watch list, because I have to register as a predator
label2 I haven't had a date in almost a decade, because if a girl googles me...  Could you walk me through what happened
label2 I meet Amy at this party, you know
label2 She's perfect
label2 I think, "what's the catch?
label2 A few months, it hits me
label2 This is not going to be easy
label2 Girls like a fixerupper, but Amy
label2 She made me her business
label2 It was just too much
label2 She went out and bought me ties
label2 And we must have gone 20 rounds over that
label2 Ties
label2 The whole thing just became...   so, you broke up with her
label2 No, I just backed away
label2 So I thought
label2 Then one night, Amy comes over to my place...  With a bottle of bourbon and a bootleg of this band I love
label2 And within two minutes, she's got my pants around my ankles...  And she is kneeling down, and..
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I know it's your wife
label2 You had sex
label2 Yeah, consensual
label2 Next morning, there's two cops at my door
label2 Ligature marks on her wrist, and my semen
label2 It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed, and raped her
label2 Me
label2 And then, guess what they find
label2 Headboards of my bed, one on each side
label2 The ties you wouldn't wear
label2 You do know your wife
label2 Yeah
label2 On TV, last week, with you
label2 "She's graduated from being raped to being murdered.
label2 You been watching this, too
label2 Last night's bombshell
label2 We just found out...  Amy elliott dunne was, indeed, pregnant when she went missing
label2 Kelly capitono, this makes me wanna throw up
label2 What is it about a pregnant woman, a woman carrying life inside her...  That turns men into animals
label2 The third leading cause of death among pregnant women...  Is homicide committed by a boyfriend or husband
label2 Let's not forget about the wife, ever
label2 Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend, noelle hawthorne
label2 Thanks for being on the show, noelle
label2 Thank you, Ellen
label2 Oh, that's nice
label2 Amy was so nurturing
label2 Oh, I'd love if just once, someone was like...  "She was a real rag.
label2 She was beautiful and smart and kind
label2 Seems like a rich bitch to me
label2 People love her
label2 I don't know
label2 She seems uppity
label2 Spoiled rich girl, married a cheating asshole
label2 The only secret was her husband
label2 We never met Nick
label2 He never introduced himself
label2 Why do you think
label2 I think we know why
label2 Because he had a violent temper
label2 A little harsh
label2 That's life, baby
label2 Don't get me wrong
label2 I'm not saying it's okay he killed her
label2 I'm just saying, there are consequences
label2 Fuck, yeah
label2 And she was so innocent
label2 You're a good friend, noelle
label2 And you're a good friend of the show
label2 Thanks for coming on
label2 Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt
label2 Tanner bolt landed me
label2 And, go...  Tanner's retainer is $100,000
label2 That's just the retainer
label2 Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings
label2 I've got $2,500 in an ira
label2 We will go from there
label2 Thank you
label2 I love you
label2 I love you, too
label2 Nick keeps his father, who has Alzheimer's, in a facility
label2 One
label2 Oh, fuck
label2 His twin sister, margo, well, she is a peach
label2 These two spend their days in the bar Amy bought them
label2 Playing house
label2 Twin siblings often enable and abet
label2 While I never examined Nick, or his sister..
label2 They both seem very, very close
label2 Disturbingly close, Lauren
label2 And so, we close with a question
label2 What kind of moral rot..
label2 Allows a beautiful, talented, kind, smart, loving mother...  To vanish without the heavens hearing our outraged cries
label2 Amy elliott dunne, we care about you, and we will not forget
label2 And you know what else we won't forget
label2 Missouri has the death penalty
label2 Amen
label2 I'd like to report some strange activity...  Near the woodshed on the property of one margo dunne
label2 Hey
label2 Mr. dunne
label2 Mr. collings
label2 I saw you at the volunteer center
label2 I wanted to help
label2 I hope you don't mind me coming by
label2 Amy and I believe in the lost art of letterwriting
label2 I always wondered why you kept in touch after...  Everything
label2 You were together for two years in boarding school, right
label2 She was my first serious girlfriend
label2 Why did you break up
label2 Did you treat her bad
label2 Did you cheat on her
label2 That's a rude question
label2 She dumped you, you completely unraveled
label2 You stalked her, you threatened her...  And you attempted suicide in her bed and were institutionalized
label2 Your wife is missing, and you came all this way to tell me this
label2 I thought there might be another side to this story
label2 Fuck
label2 The missing persons case of Amy elliott dunne
label2 She is the beautiful blonde inspiration for the amazing Amy kids' book series
label2 You're reading that diary again
label2 It interests me
label2 Hey, Rhonda
label2 "He's gonna kill me.
label2 The end
label2 It's private
label2 There's no one there
label2 Why didn't he make sure it actually burned
label2 Because he tripped the alarm
label2 The whole thing just feels hinky
label2 Like finding an envelope marked "clue.
label2 You ever hear the expression...  "The simplest answer is often the correct one"
label2 Actually, I've never found that to be true
label2 Good night
label2 Hey
label2 Thank God
label2 Come on in
label2 First thing you have to understand about Amy, she loves to teach lessons
label2 Play God
label2 Yeah, old testament God
label2 Keep talking
label2 She finds out I've been cheating on her with Andie..
label2 Fakes her own death, frames me for it
label2 Blood in the house, credit cards, life insurance
label2 She does the treasure hunt
label2 Now, the treasure hunt is critical
label2 She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities
label2 Rubbing my nose in it
label2 And she leaves clue number one for the police..
label2 Which is a place where Andie and I would often...  And she leaves a pair of red panties
label2 Right
label2 Racy, looks bad
label2 Clue two
label2 Another place where Andie and I would occasionally have relations
label2 Woodshed
label2 Also a location...  Oh, my God
label2 We had limited options
label2 A hotel
label2 Put it on Andie's credit card
label2 Andie's statement went right to her parents
label2 Nick, margo, can we head over to the little brown house
label2 This leads us to what
label2 My dad's house
label2 Dad's house is blue
label2 I used to pretend that he was a spy named Mr. brown, who...  For the sake of his children's safety, had to deny their existence
label2 You never told me that
label2 You told her that
label2 We've got incriminating red panties in your office
label2 We've got a showcase showdown worth of crap in your woodshed
label2 So, what in God's name is at your father's house, Nick
label2 I honestly have no idea
label2 Whatever they found, I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad
label2 We got a lot of uncontained issues here
label2 We haven't communicated since the vigil
label2 Okay
label2 Amy's parents
label2 No, it's...  More pressure
label2 We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will no doubt go public at any moment
label2 She will
label2 They always do
label2 Amy's got us in an interesting bind
label2 We need to tell the cops about Andie
label2 Really
label2 Right now, Andie just gives you another motive
label2 We need to be on the front end of that
label2 But I'm gonna warn you as to what will happen
label2 They'll go after margo
label2 They can't do that, can they
label2 She's your accomplice
label2 She helped you hide the evidence
label2 God
label2 Well, what are we going to do
label2 No
label2 Any other strategy is missing the point
label2 I've got two exsecret service guys that are really good
label2 I'll put them on it
label2 Where would Amy go
label2 I have no idea
label2 Hey
label2 I thought we were steering clear of men for a while
label2 He's nice
label2 Because he wants to fuck you
label2 She's still moping about her ex
label2 He got cheated on, too
label2 We three are the saddest sacks in all the ozarks
label2 I'm angry
label2 There you go
label2 I almost drank myself to death when my wife left me
label2 Can you believe that
label2 Don't give him the pleasure
label2 I was going to drown myself in the Gulf of Mexico...  Let myself be dinner for the great whites
label2 Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins
label2 Why should I die
label2 I'm not the asshole
label2 Miss moneybags
label2 That's a fat wad
label2 It's mostly singles
label2 Singles
label2 What are you, a stripper
label2 Swamp girls, or treasure chest
label2 We're just teasing
label2 Don't they tease people down in nola
label2 We've got blood in the house, huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy
label2 Crying out for justice
label2 We'll be right back
label2 Tanner has a very bad idea he's going to pitch you
label2 You're doing Sharon schieber tomorrow in St. Louis
label2 It could go so wrong
label2 And you are going to tell her about Andie
label2 Nope
label2 That sounds like a very bad idea
label2 You haven't heard from her in three days
label2 You've gotta throw yourself on it
label2 People are gonna hate me
label2 And then, they will forgive you
label2 A guy admitting that he's a gigantic asshole on television
label2 Why don't we just put out a statement
label2 They need to see you
label2 Sharon's specials, they get 10 million viewers
label2 She is a crusader
label2 If she takes you on as a cause...  she's going to ask real questions
label2 What to say, what not to say
label2 A trained monkey who doesn't get the lethal injection
label2 Nick, this case is about what people think of you
label2 They need to like you
label2 Now, you do this and you will reach millions of those people
label2 Maybe I only need to reach one
label2 Hello
label2 Hey, baby
label2 One minute
label2 Hey
label2 No, I'm just cleaning up
label2 Let us come in and say goodbye
label2 I'll come by before...  let us give you a hand
label2 Yeah, you gotta clear everything out, here
label2 Dorothy is a real stickler
label2 Not even a spare hanger can you leave behind
label2 A sock...  Or undies or what have you
label2 You did a real good job
label2 Look under her dress
label2 He talked you into this
label2 I talked him into it
label2 The second you leave, I'm calling the cops
label2 Your glasses are fake
label2 You say your name's Nancy, but you don't even answer to it half the time
label2 You're hiding
label2 I don't know why, and I don't really care
label2 But you ain't gonna call the cops
label2 And I don't think you've ever really been hit before
label2 Holy shit
label2 Next place, be more careful, okay
label2 There are a lot of people out there a lot worse than we are
label2 Excuse me
label2 You can't sleep here
label2 A little less wooden
label2 I didn't kill my wife
label2 What are you doing
label2 Every time you look smug...  Or annoyed or tense, I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear
label2 That's supposed to make me less tense
label2 Let's try it again
label2 Yeah, we had some tough years
label2 I lost my job
label2 You both did
label2 We both lost our jobs
label2 I had to move back home so we could take care of my mother...  Who was dying of cancer and my dad, who had...  your dad's scorched earth
label2 Go on
label2 For a while, things had been building up
label2 "Built up" implies that an explosion is coming
label2 At a certain point, we got on the wrong track
label2 I had a moment of weakness
label2 I disrespected my wife
label2 And I disrespected my marriage
label2 And I'll always regret it
label2 That works
label2 Don't be afraid to play up the dufus husband thing, Nick
label2 I'm a fuckup
label2 "Everything I do is wrong.
label2 I know
label2 What men are supposed to do in general
label2 Thank you
label2 I feel good
label2 Go, can you pass me that box, please
label2 It's Amy's 33rd birthday present to me
label2 You hate that watch
label2 No, go
label2 I love that watch
label2 Just like I love my wife
label2 It's you
label2 It's you
label2 I'm sorry
label2 Good God
label2 Last week..
label2 I threatened to leave, and he said he'd find me and he'd kill me
label2 I lost the baby
label2 I couldn't even tell my parents
label2 I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid
label2 Well, he is looking for you
label2 He showed up on my doorstep three days ago
label2 You saved them
label2 Knowing you were out there...  Was the only thing that's kept me going these past few years
label2 Let's go to the police
label2 You can explain everything
label2 I'd be a pariah
label2 Everyone would hate me
label2 Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison
label2 I'm setting you up at my lake house
label2 It's utterly secluded
label2 Why are you so good to me
label2 You know why
label2 I know you, don't I
label2 No
label2 No, we're from winnipeg
label2 Excuse us
label2 We should leave
label2 That was boney
label2 I'll call her later
label2 Tanner
label2 Nice to see you
label2 Sharon
label2 Hope this is worth my while
label2 You're gonna be very happy
label2 Sharon
label2 Ms. schieber
label2 Thank you so much for doing this
label2 Can I get you anything to drink or eat before we get started
label2 What the fuck
label2 I'm sorry
label2 We have a major shocking development in the amazing Amy disappearance
label2 We go live to that story now
label2 Oh, my God
label2 My name is Andie Fitzgerald
label2 When he was my creative writing teacher at mill valley
label2 Why is she dressed like a babysitter
label2 I am deeply ashamed...  Of having been romantically involved with a married man
label2 I truly believed we were in love
label2 Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite
label2 I know that is no excuse
label2 No, it is not
label2 I do not, in my heart, believe Nick dunne would have killed for me
label2 My prayers go out to everyone who loves Amy
label2 I apologize for the pain this has caused them
label2 We have loved Nick dunne like a son
label2 He met our trust with lie after lie
label2 We now absolutely believe...  Nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter
label2 Our amazing Amy
label2 This just got very exciting
label2 We need a moment
label2 We're gonna have to bow out of this
label2 Nothing has changed
label2 Everything has changed
label2 I can handle this
label2 We're on the defense
label2 This is a completely different dynamic
label2 I can handle it
label2 Just trust me
label2 Okay
label2 Great
label2 Mic him
label2 Thank you
label2 He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist
label2 Yeah, no kidding
label2 Roll tape
label2 Five... four...  Three... two..
label2 Seriously, I can't believe how fucking good you were
label2 Amy brings out the best in me
label2 Don't
label2 People still hate you
label2 Women want to scratch your eyes out
label2 Andie was really good TV
label2 She's a good person
label2 Ride this out...  And when Sharon airs tomorrow, we'll be looking at a whole new you
label2 But, until then...  Don't show your face
label2 No problem
label2 Welcome
label2 Make yourself at home
label2 I've got music, satellite...  Netflix
label2 He was her teacher
label2 Internet, obviously
label2 Here is a supposedly grown man...  if there is ever anything you have a taste for and you can't find it...  Just let me know and I will get it for you
label2 And just think how her mother must feel at a time like this
label2 Wine cellar's downstairs
label2 I'll get you some clothes, too
label2 The floors are heated, just dial to your liking
label2 There's robes and towels
label2 The shower has steam
label2 The bathtub has a massage cycle
label2 There's a great view, if you're in the mood
label2 Blackout curtains if you're not
label2 The bed is savoir
label2 This is just what I need
label2 I'm so exhausted
label2 I'll leave you to it, then
label2 Amy, I am so happy that you are here
label2 And I don't want you to worry for one moment
label2 The exterior, all along the grounds, the entryway
label2 Anyone...  Who is caught coming or going...  Will be recorded
label2 And I am not letting you get away again
label2 Good morning
label2 Don't do that
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I need to feel safe
label2 What have you been up to
label2 Amy, I'm not Nick
label2 It's hard for me
label2 After so many years under someone's thumb..
label2 I know just what that feels like
label2 On your leash
label2 Never
label2 A new start
label2 Decent clothes
label2 Hair dye
label2 Makeup
label2 Tweezers
label2 There's a gym overlooking the lake
label2 I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch Sharon schieber, and finally move on
label2 I think that's something I should watch on my own
label2 Nonsense
label2 And I am looking forward...  To my reunion with Amy elliott
label2 Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber
label2 Tonight, exclusively..
label2 Hurry up
label2 A husband breaks his silence, not just on his wife's disappearance..
label2 But on his infidelity, and all those shocking rumors
label2 Nick dunne...  You're probably the most hated man in America right now
label2 And I probably deserve it
label2 I bought that tie
label2 Did you kill your wife, Nick
label2 I did not kill my wife
label2 But you were unfaithful
label2 I was unfaithful
label2 And I am deeply ashamed
label2 And, on top of that, you allowed Amy's parents..
label2 Her friends, all the people in your hometown..
label2 Believe you were a loving husband, desperate to find his missing wife
label2 You say that, but I'm wondering how you expect us to believe you...  Now that we know you're a liar
label2 I didn't come forward with my affair...  Because I knew it would make me look really, really bad
label2 I just want to find my wife
label2 I'm just trying to get clear...  Let me be clear
label2 I'm not a good guy
label2 I was a bad husband to a great wife
label2 I broke the vow that I made to her
label2 Those are pretty words, Nick
label2 But what does that really mean to you
label2 It basically means that I was a con artist
label2 I met Amy elliott seven years ago
label2 I was completely transfixed
label2 And I met a woman who dazzled me
label2 And I wanted her to love me..
label2 So I pretended to be better than I was
label2 When we got married, I promised to be that guy
label2 That guy who works harder
label2 That guy who, who lives and acts...  And loves with as much passion as she does
label2 But I failed her
label2 I did what was easy
label2 You talk like a man who believes he can make amends to his wife
label2 Who believes his wife is still alive
label2 She is still alive
label2 Will you look in the lens...  And talk to your wife
label2 If she is out there, able to hear and see you tonight...  What would you like to say to her, Nick
label2 Amy, I love you
label2 And I've taken myself to the woodshed for the way that I've treated you
label2 And if you come back, I promise..
label2 I will spend every day making it up to you
label2 I love you
label2 Come home
label2 Here
label2 Regardless of what you thought...  What does it say
label2 I think we can all agree...  Oh, my God
label2 You fucking killed it
label2 They're going crazy for you
label2 They disliked me, they liked me, they hated me
label2 And now they love me
label2 He's certainly earned mine
label2 What is it
label2 Good night
label2 Margo dunne, this is a search warrant for your property
label2 I usually ignore tipline calls..
label2 But a neighbor was concerned about a strange man around your woodshed
label2 Call Tanner
label2 Okay
label2 Girlfriend's real cute, Nick
label2 Is that what this is about
label2 I have treated you more than fair throughout this entire investigation
label2 Every time you said something stupid..
label2 I thought, "maybe he's just stupid.
label2 But I was wrong
label2 That's what this is about
label2 None of that is mine
label2 None of this was put here by me
label2 Those are nice clubs
label2 You got the makings of a real man cave
label2 Nick
label2 You can't do that
label2 Of course we can
label2 Amy, it's time to move on
label2 What can I do to help
label2 I need some time to think
label2 That's the last thing you need
label2 Finally, last night, you came to me, and you chose me
label2 Follow that instinct
label2 I'm not gonna force myself on you
label2 I understand what you're saying, desi
label2 I do
label2 I've forgotten how to behave
label2 I'll move in here tomorrow...  And we'll work it out together
label2 I just want you to be you again
label2 They only took margo to fuck with you
label2 I'm gonna go in, and I'm gonna tell them everything
label2 What
label2 We tell boney very little
label2 So, you let them do all the talking
label2 That way, we can jumpstart your defense
label2 The truth is my defense
label2 Recognize these
label2 It's Amy's anniversary present to me
label2 Was that how she told you she was pregnant, Nick
label2 Mommy, daddy, baby, and that made you real mad
label2 No
label2 Recognize this
label2 Never seen that before in my life
label2 It's Amy's diary
label2 We found this at your father's house
label2 He's not a handwriting ex...  Looks like it
label2 Our experts thought so, too
label2 Do you wanna play a little true or false
label2 "And then he brushes the sugar off my lips so he can taste me.
label2 Yeah, that's true
label2 That is also true, yes
label2 She wanted to get pregnant, you assaulted her
label2 I hit her
label2 No, never happened
label2 "Pushed," it says "pushed.
label2 Absolutely not
label2 She tried to buy a gun
label2 I doubt that, but I don't know
label2 Shall I read the last entry
label2 Sure
label2 In her own words, "this man may kill me.
label2 It's kind of a convenient end note
label2 For future reference..
label2 The truth, you are not a handwriting expert
label2 Okay, I know
label2 Big as a twobyfour, right
label2 Big as a club
label2 We didn't know what the hell it was, but fire in July
label2 We bagged it
label2 I've never seen that before either
label2 We just tested it
label2 Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick
label2 Do not say another word
label2 What about my side
label2 Nick
label2 More coffee
label2 Remember that time we skipped school and drove to the cape
label2 God, yeah
label2 Lobster right from the ocean
label2 This reminds me of that
label2 You're not bored
label2 Desi, how could I be bored
label2 You can discuss 18thcentury symphonies...  19thcentury impressionists, quote proust in French
label2 I really have to get going
label2 But I will be back just as soon as I can
label2 My keys
label2 Thank you
label2 Dunne
label2 You got one hell of a lawyer
label2 Hey
label2 Are you okay
label2 Yes
label2 Are you
label2 Let's go
label2 Well, you're out on bond
label2 You can relax at home while we prep for trial
label2 Keep your head down
label2 Tanner, is there any fucking lead on Amy
label2 I've got two of my best guys on it
label2 She's air
label2 I dare you
label2 Mr. collings is home
label2 I've missed you
label2 I've been thinking..
label2 I don't wanna be without you
label2 Stay with me
label2 And when all this dies down, we'll go to Greece, like you said
label2 Octopus and scrabble
label2 How long do you think until it's done
label2 Six months for the trial
label2 Sentencing will be quick
label2 He'll appeal
label2 I can watch the rest overseas
label2 But I want it
label2 Don't rush
label2 Just do it
label2 Harder
label2 Her wounds are consistent with rape
label2 There was semen present
label2 We'll make sure it's a match
label2 Yeah, it'll match
label2 What do you think
label2 Are we pals again
label2 Now that I know you didn't murder your wife, yes
label2 What do you think
label2 Kidnapping
label2 The story's insane
label2 It's okay
label2 I want to help
label2 So we'll keep this very brief
label2 Can you walk us through what happened
label2 That morning, the doorbell rang
label2 So normal
label2 So strange
label2 Since high school, he won't ever go away
label2 And I've just tried to be nice to him
label2 Answer his letters
label2 Oh, my God
label2 I've encouraged him
label2 You can't blame yourself
label2 He pushed inside
label2 And he grabbed me
label2 But I got away, and ran to the kitchen
label2 I collapsed
label2 That club was actually the handle to a punch and Judy puppet
label2 Right
label2 Treasure hunt
label2 I'd hidden some puppets at go's...  then how did desi have that handle
label2 It must have fallen off
label2 So, he got it from me
label2 About that woodshed..
label2 He took me to his lake house
label2 Tied me to his bed
label2 Real quick
label2 When you went to place the puppets there...  Did you notice that it was packed...  lots of stuff
label2 Corresponding to purchases made on credit cards in your husband's name
label2 Nick and credit cards
label2 He buys, I nag
label2 I don't know, probably
label2 He hid a lot of stuff at go's
label2 They're very close
label2 Please continue, Ms. dunne
label2 Desi assaulted me that night
label2 Every night
label2 He tied me up like a dog
label2 Starve me
label2 Shave me
label2 Sodomize me
label2 Please find this
label2 She slit his throat with a box cutter
label2 How did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter..
label2 If he had her tied up the whole time
label2 Can't you just be happy your wife is home and safe
label2 Amy, we found your diary
label2 It contains many concerning allegations of mental and physical abuse
label2 Well, it's the ugly truth
label2 Nick didn't want a baby
label2 We had money problems
label2 But I love him
label2 Then why did you try to buy a gun
label2 If I could just clarify one thing...  if this case had been left in your deeply incompetent hands...  My husband would be on death row...  And I'd be tied, still, spreadeagle...  Ms. dunne, you've been very brave
label2 We're finished
label2 Now, I have to ask you...  Do you feel safe going home with your husband
label2 We prayed to God, and God has answered our prayers
label2 Amy dunne is home
label2 But for right now, we wanna sit tight...  And just be thankful and grateful for this miracle on the Mississippi
label2 Excuse me
label2 Excuse us, folks
label2 We love you, Amy
label2 I'm not pretending
label2 You were perfect
label2 You do know I was just telling you what you wanted to hear, right
label2 That's how well you know me
label2 You know me in your marrow
label2 Okay
label2 Take off your clothes
label2 I need to make sure you're not wearing a wire
label2 You killed someone, Amy
label2 I'm a fighter
label2 I fought my way back to you
label2 You killed a guy
label2 You slashed his throat with a box cutter
label2 And I obliged
label2 But I want that Nick
label2 I'm leaving
label2 You really think that's smart
label2 Wounded, raped wife battles her way back to her husband...  And he deserts her
label2 They'll destroy you
label2 Neighbors will shun you
label2 And I'll make sure that no one forgets the pain you caused me
label2 I don't want anything to do with your groupies outside
label2 Once they go..
label2 I go
label2 Sleep on it
label2 There can be
label2 Good night
label2 Hey, Nick
label2 Crepe
label2 Sure
label2 She was his dream girl
label2 And when this spoiled, rich, entitled little boy couldn't have her..
label2 You must be so proud
label2 It's been four hours
label2 Nick
label2 Nick
label2 What's next for you and Amy
label2 When two people love each other and can't make that work...  That's the real tragedy
label2 Kiss my cheek
label2 I can't believe that fucking spider is America's sweetheart
label2 She told me she killed desi
label2 Not selfdefense
label2 Murder
label2 Can't we get a wire
label2 Yeah, because she had me strip naked, and stand in the shower
label2 I swear, you two are the most fuckedup people I've ever known
label2 And I specialize in fuckedup
label2 You and Amy under the same roof
label2 You should pitch that as reality television
label2 Nick and I have been through some bad patches
label2 We've had our dark days
label2 But we thank you so much...  For supporting us in our new life together, for forgiving Nick
label2 Really, your encouragement means the world
label2 She's good
label2 The real housewives of branson
label2 Take care of this guy, will you
label2 I can't believe you're just leaving now
label2 You are not at risk anymore
label2 I'm the definition of "at risk.
label2 You may wanna thank her
label2 Just don't piss her off
label2 See you, guys
label2 Elvis has left Missouri
label2 We need to check Amy's story, piece by piece
label2 Nick, I can't do anything
label2 We had the national spotlight on us, we stained the rug
label2 That doesn't mean you have to be done
label2 It does
label2 Couldn't sleep
label2 Come on...  Let me tuck you back in
label2 You know you can sleep with me, right
label2 Yeah, it's just..
label2 I would never, ever hurt you
label2 I do need you to participate, though
label2 I need you to do your part
label2 Okay
label2 Everything you have heard about my wife...  Is a lie
label2 She is a calculating, murderous psychopath
label2 And I have been complicit...  Nick
label2 Nick
label2 Honey
label2 Not the entire time, but on and off throughout
label2 "So, Nick, how does it feel to have your wife back?
label2 "It's fantastic
label2 "How many people are lucky enough to get a second chance at love?
label2 "Fantastic" is a little flippant
label2 I need you to admit that you got the credit cards...  And that you hid all that stuff at go's and that you pushed me
label2 I'm gonna need those three things to feel safe
label2 Don't worry
label2 I know exactly what to say
label2 Nick
label2 What a beautiful home
label2 I so appreciate you giving us this time, Nick
label2 You went on national television...  And told people that I murdered my wife
label2 You implied that I had carnal relations with my sister
label2 I didn't use the "I" word
label2 I said you two were "extremely close.
label2 You and a panel of nitwits diagnosed me as a sociopath
label2 Icebreaker
label2 To go with your robot dog
label2 What is it
label2 It's for you
label2 Open it
label2 I don't need any more gifts from you
label2 Open it
label2 I didn't touch you
label2 You didn't need to
label2 Bullshit
label2 You threw it out
label2 The notice, yes
label2 I want a blood test
label2 I want a paternity test
label2 I love tests
label2 You can teach those people to hate me all you want
label2 I don't care
label2 I won't have to teach your child to hate you
label2 He'll do that all by himself
label2 I'm the cunt you married
label2 The only time you liked yourself...  Was when you were trying to be someone this cunt might like
label2 I'm not a quitter
label2 I'm that cunt
label2 I've killed for you
label2 Who else can say that
label2 No way, baby
label2 I'm it
label2 Look, you're delusional
label2 Why would you even want this
label2 Yes, I loved you
label2 And cause each other pain
label2 That's marriage
label2 Now, I'm getting ready
label2 I can't watch you play house with that thing for the next 18 years
label2 I can't just walk away
label2 No, I won't
label2 And you know it
label2 It's gonna be my child
label2 I'm not gonna leave it
label2 You wanna stay
label2 I have a responsibility
label2 You wanna stay with her
label2 Go, you're my voice of reason
label2 I need you with me on this
label2 Of course I'm with you
label2 I was with you before we were even born
label2 We've been through the darkness
label2 We've come out, united
label2 We communicate
label2 We're honest with each other
label2 And
label2 And
label2 We're gonna be parents
label2 My goodness
label2 Thank you
label2 "What are you thinking?
label2 "How are you feeling?
label2 "What have we done to each other?
label2 "What will we do?
label2 I wrote it all down: 4,200 square feet, four floors
label2 Courtyard in back, southfacing garden
label2 Perfect
label2 Shouldn't we wait for the car service
label2 No, we'll sit in traffic forever
label2 Is that the listing sheet
label2 There is no listing sheet
label2 It'll be gone by this afternoon   Well, how many more after this one
label2 None
label2 Sarah, do you have to ride that here
label2 Mom, we're in the street
label2 Evan
label2 One day you will learn to respect people's time, Lydia
label2 I’m so sorry
label2 I’m meeting Arthur Digby Laurence in 26 minutes...  ...and if you think he's the kind of man who tolerates tardiness...  ...you are sadly mistaken
label2 You're a saint to wait for us
label2 Thank you
label2 Hello
label2 It’s kind of between a townhouse and a brownstone
label2 Built in 1879, this is the middle of the house, the parlor floor
label2 Here is the living room
label2 Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...  ...which was renovated in '94 with all the expected amenities
label2 Sarah
label2 There are two bedroom floors above
label2 My God, it's amazing
label2 Hey, kid
label2 I don't have to tell you this amount of living space is uncommon in Manhattan
label2 It’s got a yard
label2 Sort of
label2 It allows for an expansive garden
label2 Working elevator
label2 The previous owner was disabled the last years of his life
label2 Highly unusual, the elevator
label2 You will not find this in 90 percent of brownstones
label2 Perhaps it's something of a fixerupper, but we anticipate enormous interest
label2 Shall we have a look at the rest
label2 You should make an offer immediately
label2 Can I see it first
label2 You can't move from Greenwich to the Upper West Side...  ...and expect to still have a house, a yard and a dog and cat, but here it is
label2 It’s got everything you told me you wanted and more
label2 You could have two
label2 It’s a fortune
label2 Mom, it's not Barneys
label2 You don't have to pay the price on the tag
label2 He can afford it
label2 Hardwood floors throughout, as many as six working fireplaces
label2 This is the top floor
label2 Two bedrooms
label2 They share one small bath
label2 Originally, this would have been the servants' quarters
label2 The previous owner kept a small nursing staff
label2 I don't know if you have livein help
label2 No, it's just the two of us
label2 Third floor, spare bedroom, den, or what have you
label2 He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine, the financier
label2 May I ask what you do, Mrs....  Altman
label2 Actually, I’m going back to school
label2 Her husband's in pharmaceuticals
label2 I didn't realize you were Stephan Altman's wife
label2 Yes, until recently
label2 Master bath
label2 Pearlstine's been in all the papers since he died
label2 He was a recluse
label2 Rich, paranoid
label2 Now they can't find half his money
label2 Stop calling it "the property.
label2 It sounds ridiculous
label2 Walkin closet
label2 Could the little one please stop that
label2 Kid, no elevator
label2 That's strange
label2 Is this room smaller than it should be
label2 You're the first person to notice
label2 On caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea
label2 It’s called a panic room
label2 What
label2 A safe room
label2 A castle keep in medieval times
label2 They're in vogue in highend construction
label2 One can't be too careful about home invasion
label2 This is perfect
label2 What will you do
label2 Call the police and wait till Tuesday
label2 Traipse downstairs in your underthings to check it out
label2 Concrete walls
label2 Buried phone line, not connected to the house's main line
label2 Call the police, nobody can cut you off
label2 You have your own ventilation system
label2 A bank of surveillance monitors that covers nearly every corner of the house
label2 This whole thing makes me nervous
label2 Ever read any Poe
label2 What's to keep somebody from prying open the door
label2 Steel
label2 Thick steel
label2 Very thick steel
label2 Full battery backup, so even if the power's out...  ...it's still functional
label2 Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he
label2 Open it, please
label2 And with kids like he's apparently got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide
label2 Please open the door
label2 That is highly inappropriate
label2 My room
label2 Definitely my room
label2 That door is a hazard
label2 Not at all
label2 Motion detector, like an elevator
label2 The door won't close if it's blocked
label2 There's another one at your ankles
label2 I know they'll take asking price
label2 It’s working
label2 I hooked up the phone
label2 Good for you, Mom
label2 Hooked up a phone
label2 579 what
label2 Patsy's Pizza
label2 please hold
label2 Hey
label2 Enough
label2 What do you mean
label2 I should've thought of something special
label2 I like pizza
label2 Fuck him
label2 Don't
label2 Fuck her, too
label2 I agree
label2 Don't you think this place has way too many stairs
label2 You didn't carry anything up them
label2 You never asked what I thought of this house
label2 I didn't want you to tell me you hated it
label2 I liked our old house
label2 You know what I was thinking
label2 I was thinking we could stencil the whole bookcase
label2 We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves
label2 Go ahead
label2 Oh, damn
label2 Dad already did it
label2 I’m going with him on Sunday
label2 So I’ll take a cab and meet him there
label2 Is that what he said
label2 Isn't that what's so great about Manhattan
label2 You don't have to drive me everywhere
label2 Why'd you bring me here if I can't go anywhere on my own
label2 That's it
label2 I quit
label2 I’m not fighting with you till tomorrow
label2 Come here
label2 It’s disgusting how much I love you
label2 Yeah
label2 It’s too dark
label2 Better
label2 That's better
label2 "Bypass nonready zone.
label2 "Bypass nonready zone.
label2 "Shunt
label2 "Bypass nonready zone.
label2 "Shunt.
label2 "Enter zone number.
label2 "Shunt again.
label2 ln the morning I got to figure out how to turn this thing off
label2 Do it
label2 Come on
label2 Jesus fucking Christ
label2 Amateur
label2 We got a problem
label2 We need to talk
label2 It’s about time
label2 I’m freezing my tits off out there
label2 This is Raoul
label2 Who the fuck is Raoul
label2 Raoul is okay
label2 Where'd you get him
label2 Through some people
label2 Open the fucking door
label2 No shit
label2 There's a girl on the top floor, a woman on the third
label2 They're asleep
label2 They're not supposed to be here
label2 This is your department, Junior
label2 They are not supposed to be here
label2 We're on videotape
label2 We've been on videotape since we got here and the tapes are upstairs
label2 14day escrow
label2 You fucked me
label2 That's almost 3 weeks
label2 Exactly how is 14 days three weeks
label2 Business days
label2 Escrow is always business days
label2 Fiveday weeks always
label2 Right
label2 Just wait a minute
label2 Wait a minute
label2 We can handle this
label2 Can we still handle this
label2 It’s just a woman and a kid
label2 Unless Daddy comes home
label2 Daddy's banging some B model on the Upper East Side
label2 It’s just her and the kid
label2 Now, can we do this
label2 Yeah, we can do it
label2 And not with me
label2 Wait
label2 Twenty minutes
label2 She'll call the police
label2 They'll be here before I unpack my bags
label2 So, we keep an eye on her
label2 I don't want Raoul to administrate that
label2 He's not even supposed to be here
label2 Nobody gets hurt
label2 What about us
label2 What if she has a gun
label2 Who are you
label2 You know we can't do this without you
label2 This is still a good plan
label2 This is a great plan
label2 It’s just got a slight twist
label2 Felony kidnapping
label2 Thirty years
label2 You make a lot of promises, don't you
label2 You promise me, you promise your kids
label2 No family
label2 You're right
label2 It’s all fucked up
label2 I fucked it up
label2 Hey, I want that money
label2 I want it
label2 But you...  ...you need that money
label2 Or have you forgotten why you're here
label2 So let's quit dicking around, okay, and get this over with

label2 Don't worry about me
label2 What do you think he'll do
label2 Hang out while the cops waltz in
label2 Use your head
label2 Here he comes
label2 I locked the roof access
label2 She's not getting down from there
label2 Good
label2 Could she have hooked it up today
label2 No
label2 You don't just call up Bell Atlantic
label2 I checked the paperwork and the phone is not connected
label2 You see
label2 I thought she wouldn't be here
label2 He said she wouldn't
label2 Fuck you
label2 And fuck you
label2 She is not supposed...  Do it
label2 Excuse me
label2 She's lying
label2 You're full of...  It’s not an intercom
label2 It’s a PA system
label2 I know
label2 I suggest you leave before they get here
label2 What
label2 He's saying that we don't have a phone
label2 How could he know that
label2 If only it were that easy
label2 Some paper
label2 I need some paper
label2 Give me some paper
label2 You going to help us out
label2 You got a piece of paper
label2 I don't know
label2 "What we want is in that room"
label2 They're coming in here, aren't they
label2 I told you
label2 They can't get in here
label2 What do you know about this room
label2 What do we know about that room
label2 Just a few details
label2 We're not coming out, and we're not letting you in
label2 Get out of my house
label2 Say "fuck.
label2 You fuck
label2 Mom
label2 What
label2 Get the fuck out of my house
label2 She's a woman
label2 Women need security
label2 She won't believe you
label2 She needs to know she's dealing with decent people and she can trust us
label2 What
label2 She's not coming down
label2 Shut up
label2 Will you please shut up and let me think
label2 You know what
label2 Fine
label2 You think
label2 What if she did call the cops
label2 She didn't
label2 If cops were coming, do you think l'd still be here
label2 Okay, fine
label2 Good, excellent
label2 We all believe you
label2 What is funny about this
label2 Is this shit funny to you
label2 I spent the last 12 years building these rooms...  ...to keep out people like us
label2 It’s all so ironic and amusing, okay
label2 We can't
label2 You can't get in the panic room
label2 That's the whole point
label2 We have to get her to come out
label2 And why would she do that
label2 I don't know
label2 We keep her here, we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...  ...and I don't want any help from Joe Pesci over here
label2 They want to hole up in this house
label2 Fine
label2 We make it impossible for them to leave
label2 I’m working on that
label2 Are you okay
label2 Yeah
label2 I’m okay
label2 You can't wig out
label2 I know
label2 I mean it
label2 I won't
label2 You know, people never get buried alive anymore
label2 Really
label2 Yeah, I read that
label2 And when did this happen all the time
label2 Twenty, thirty years ago
label2 I don't know
label2 They're locking us in
label2 Sarah, calm down
label2 You know what could happen if you let yourself get worked up
label2 Sarah
label2 What the hell are you doing

label2 You know, not much time for this transition thing
label2 I meant to ask you something, when we spoke on the phone before
label2 Yeah
label2 Why here
label2 WeIl, all this effort to get transferred
label2 It's the first question that popped into my head
label2 Or the same reasons you had before you decided to quit, yeah
label2 You just met me
label2 Maybe I'm not understanding the question
label2 It's very simple
label2 You actually fought to get reassigned here
label2 I've just never seen it done that way before
label2 It would be great
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 I want you to look and l want you to listen, okay

label2 MILLS: Wait a minute
label2 DAVIS: Did l stutter
label2 This guy ain't breathing unless he started breathing spaghetti sauce
label2 MILLS: So that's how it's done around here
label2 DAVIS: I beg your pardon, detective
label2 If he wasn't dead, he would've stood up by now
label2 AIl right, thank you, officer
label2 Okay
label2 Thank you
label2 I wonder
label2 MILLS: Don't know
label2 How many times has Barney Fife found dead bodies that weren't dead
label2 Drop it
label2 Somebody phone Guinness
label2 I think we've got a record here
label2 <i>Better Homes and Gardens.</i>   Oof
label2 Who said this was murder
label2 Guy's heart's gotta be the size of a canned ham
label2 If this isn't a coronary, well, ha, ha, I don't know
label2 Whoops
label2 How about that
label2 We had this case once
label2 Knife in his back
label2 Gotta be murder, right
label2 Anyway, big insurance policy involved, yeah

label2 He's dead
label2 Thank you, doctor
label2 You've seen my files, right
label2 Nope
label2 I did my time on doortodoors and walking the beat
label2 I did that shit for a Iong time
label2 Badge on my belt says "detective.
label2 That's the same as yours
label2 Look, I made a decision
label2 I had to consider the integrity of the scene
label2 Couldn't worry whether you thought you were getting enough on the playing fieId
label2 Hey, man.. 
label2 
label2 ..just don't be jerking me off, that's all I ask
label2 He's been dead a long time
label2 MILLS: Oh, man
label2 How does someone let themselves go like that
label2 SANTIAGO: lt took four orderlies just to get him on the table
label2 How'd the fat fuck ever fit out his front door

label2 lt's obvious he was a shutin
label2 See how big this stomach is
label2 And the strange thing is, it stretches
label2 Look at the size of the cardiac orifice, where the food  Wait, l see what you're pointing out, but that means nothing to me
label2 Okay
label2 He's got lines of distention across the duodenum
label2 This man ate till he burst
label2 He didn't really burst
label2 Not all the way
label2 He was hemorrhaging internally
label2 And there was a hematoma in the rectus and transverse abdominis muscles
label2 So he did die by eating
label2 Yes and no
label2 WeIl, I haven't figured that out yet
label2 Gun pressed against his head

label2 And there was definitely a point when he passed out
label2 Oof
label2 Sadistic fucker, huh
label2 SOMERSET: When you want somebody dead, you drive by and shoot
label2 You don't risk the time it takes to do this
label2 Unless the act itself has meaning
label2 CAPTAIN: Come on
label2 Somebody had a problem with the fat boy and decided to torture him
label2 In the grocery bags, we found two receipts
label2 That means the killer stopped in the middle
label2 ..  
label2 ..and made a second trip to the supermarket

label2 Hmm, well, it's a good name, William
label2 William, l'd Iike you to meet David

label2 Would you like something to drink
label2 Uh, no
label2 No, thanks
label2 I'll wait
label2 Okay, you can just throw that anywhere
label2 I understand you two were high school sweethearts
label2 TRACY: Mmhm
label2 Pretty hokey, huh
label2 You know something
label2 I knew on our first date that this was the guy I was gonna marry
label2 Really
label2 Mmhm
label2 Really
label2 I mean, that level of commitment
label2 Oh, don't worry
label2 I won't wear it to the dinner table
label2 No, ha, ha
label2 I, uh You know, no matter how often I see guns, I just  I can't get used to them
label2 Same here
label2 Why aren't you married, William
label2 Oh, Trace, what the hell
label2 It just didn't happen
label2 It surprises me
label2 It really does
label2 Well
label2 
label2 
label2 Anyone who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me disagreeable
label2 Just ask your husband
label2 Very, very true
label2 So how long have you lived here
label2 Too long
label2 How are you liking it
label2 It'll be good
label2 WeIl, you get numb after awhile
label2 There are things to any city
label2 Subway
label2 It's nothing
label2 Real estate guy
label2 Fucking piece of
label2 
label2 
label2 He's... 
label2 He shows us the place a few times
label2 I think he's good
label2 He's efficient
label2 Tracy really likes him
label2 Then l start wondering why will he only bring us here five minutes at a time, yeah
label2 The soothing, relaxing, vibrating home, huh
label2 I'm sorry
label2 Yeah, all right, laugh it up
label2 All right, already
label2 The guy would've had to get in...  
label2 ..before the office was closed and security tightened
label2 Now, Gould would've been working late
label2 I'm certain
label2 Infamous, really
label2 Now listen, body was found on Tuesday morning
label2 The office was closed on Monday, which means the guy could've gotten in Friday
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 ..Sunday, maybe even Monday
label2 Hey, look at this
label2 Gould was bound, right arm almost free
label2 Check out the scale
label2 SOMERSET: A pound of flesh
label2 Yeah
label2 <i>Merchant of Venice.</i> Didn't see it
label2 "This task done and he would go free.
label2 I'm telling you that chair was soaked through with sweat
label2 The killer would've wanted Gould to take his time
label2 ..  
label2 Imagine it
label2 There's a gun in your face
label2 Which part of your body is expendable
label2 What about the love handle
label2 Cut along the side of his own stomach
label2 All right, let's take a fresh look at these
label2 Edit out the initial shock
label2 ..until it's an exhausted possibility
label2 Just gonna get another beer
label2 Beer
label2 Uh, wine, pIease
label2 He's preaching
label2 He's punishing
label2 There were seven cardinal virtues and seven deadly sins
label2 
label2 
label2 ..used as teaching tools
label2 Yeah, yeah, yeah, like in, uh, The Parson's Tale and  What's this
label2 Uh, Dante
label2 Yeah
label2 Well, parts
label2 Hey, remember in, uh, Purgatory
label2 Dante and his buddy, they're climbing up the hill.. 
label2 ..they're checking out all the sinners, yeah
label2 Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation
label2 Yeah, yeah, right
label2 But there, pride comes first, not gluttony
label2 Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider that the books were the killer's inspiration
label2 The sermons were about atonement for sin
label2 These murders are like forced attrition
label2 Attrition
label2 It's when you regret your sins, but not because you Iove God
label2 Mmhm
label2 No fingerprints
label2 Nope
label2 Totally unrelated victims
label2 Yup
label2 And no witnesses of any kind
label2 WeIl, in any major city, minding your own business is a science
label2 The first thing they teach women in rape prevention is never cry for help
label2 Always yell "Fire.
label2 Nobody answers to "Help.
label2 You holler "fire," they come running
label2 That's fucked up
label2 He must've left another puzzle piece
label2 You know what
label2 This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity
label2 I'm still leaving at the end of the week
label2 Oh, shit
label2 No, wait, wait
label2 Gould's wife
label2 She was out of town at the time
label2 What if it's a threat
label2 WeIl, I put her in a safe house
label2 She wasn't too happy about it
label2 SOMERSET: What if it isn't something she has seen
label2 Yeah, okay
label2 What
label2 I don't know
label2 But that's the one thing
label2 MILLS: Sign us in
label2 GOULD: treat me like a prisoner
label2 Why do you have a phone if l can't make long distance phone calls
label2 Mrs. Gould
label2 GOULD: Don't treat people like this
label2 I truly am
label2 I don't understand
label2 Okay, l need you to Iook at each photo very carefully
label2 Look and see if there's anything strange or out of place
label2 Um, anything at all
label2 You're sure
label2 Okay
label2 SOMERSET [WHlSPERS]: It's got to be now
label2 There may be something we haven't seen
label2 GOULD: Wait
label2 What
label2 Here
label2 This painting, it's upside down
label2 No, no
label2 Those shots were taken before forensics
label2 There's gotta be something
label2 Moved the screws to rehang it
label2 Yep
label2 What the fuck is that
label2 Switchblade
label2 There must be something
label2 He didn't paint the fucking thing
label2 No, he's fucking with us, that's what he's doing
label2 See this
label2 This is us
label2 Just wait a minute
label2 Just wait a minute
label2 You're kidding me
label2 Call the Print Lab
label2 Oh, man
label2 No
label2 MAN: I can tell you, guys, just by looking at the swirl pattern...  
label2 ..they're not the victim's fingerprints
label2 I don't know, man
label2 I say he's whacked enough
label2 It doesn't fit
label2 He doesn't wants us to help him stop
label2 So many freaks out there doing their little evil deeds they don't wanna do
label2 "The voices made me do it
label2 Jodie Foster told me to do it.
label2 You know, um, I've seen this baby take as long as three days to make a match...  
label2 ..so maybe you guys wanna cross your fingers somewhere else
label2 You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you
label2 Yeah
label2 SOMERSET: Hmm
label2 Wish I still thought the way you do
label2 Picking up the pieces
label2 We're collecting all the evidence, taking all the pictures and samples
label2 Writing everything down
label2 Noting the time things happened
label2 That's all
label2 Putting everything into neat little piles and filing it away
label2 On the off chance it will ever be needed in the courtroom
label2 Picking up diamonds on a deserted island
label2 MILLS: Bullshit
label2 Even the most promising clues usually only lead to others
label2 So many corpses roll away unrevenged
label2 Don't try to tell me you didn't get that rush tonight
label2 I saw you
label2 We're getting somewhere
label2 Wake up, Glimmer Twins
label2 This guy goes by the name of Victor
label2 His real name is Theodore Allen
label2 He's got a Iong history of serious mental illness
label2 His parents gave him a very strict Southern Baptist upbringing
label2 But somewhere along the line, they fell short
label2 Spent time in prison here a whiIe back for the attempted rape of a minor
label2 But his lawyer saw to it that didn't last long
label2 His lawyer, by the way, is the recently deceased Eli Gould
label2 Greed murder victim
label2 OFFlCER: Yes, sir
label2 Victor's been out of circulation a whiIe, but there's still a residence in his name
label2 You're not buying all this, are you
label2 Doesn't seem like our guy, does it
label2 You tell me
label2 Our killer seems to have more purpose
label2 You ever take a bullet
label2 I've only taken my gun out three times with the intention of using it
label2 Never pulled the trigger
label2 Not once
label2 Yeah, but, no, l never took a bullet, but I pulled my gun once, shot it once
label2 RealIy
label2 It was my first one of these
label2 I was pretty shaky going in
label2 I was a rookie then
label2 Anyway, we bust open the door looking for this junkie and, uh...  
label2 ..the fucker just opened fire on us
label2 One cop got hit in the arm
label2 Christ, what was his name
label2 You know, I mean, more like slow motion
label2 I remember
label2 ..  
label2 ..riding in that ambuIance
label2 Right there
label2 Christ, what was his fucking name
label2 OFFlCER 2: Let's do it
label2 Let's do it
label2 OFFlCER 1 : Go, go, go
label2 Move
label2 Okay
label2 OFFlCER 3: Get up there
label2 Hey
label2 They love this
label2 Police
label2 Clear
label2 OFFlCER: Clear
label2 Clear
label2 Morning, sweetheart
label2 Get up now, motherfucker

label2 SOMERSET: Call an ambulance
label2 OFFICER: What is this
label2 CALIFORNIA: Hearse more like it
label2 SOMERSET: Also Forensics
label2 No one touches anything
label2 It's some frigging wax sculpture or something
label2 "Sloth.
label2 MILLS: Oh, man
label2 SOMERSET: Those pictures were dated three days ago
label2 This must be the first one
label2 Look
label2 It's dated exactly one year ago today
label2 He's laughing at us
label2 You got what you deserved
label2 CALIFORNIA: He's alive, he's alive
label2 That cocksucker's alive
label2 SOMERSET: Guns down
label2 Still breathing
label2 Guns down
label2 Emergency on that ambulance
label2 He's playing games
label2 Look, we have to divorce ourselves from emotion here
label2 Oh
label2 No matter how hard it is, we have to remain focused
label2 How's that
label2 Are you listening to me
label2 Yes, I can hear you
label2 MAN: Excuse me
label2 What are you doing
label2 Closed crime scene, get out
label2 UPI photographer
label2 Get out
label2 MAN: Hey, I got a fucking right to be here
label2 MILLS: Get out of here

label2 Fuck you
label2 Oh, yeah
label2 MAN: I got your picture
label2 MILLS: Yeah
label2 Detective Mills, MlLLS, fuck off
label2 MILLS: Fuck you
label2 How do they get here so fucking quick
label2 They pay police for the information
label2 And they pay well
label2 
label2 ..  Those, ugh.. 
label2 
label2 You know, they piss me off
label2 It's okay
label2 BEARDSLEY: A year of immobility seems about right
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 ..judging by the deterioration of the muscles and the spine
label2 Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his system
label2 
label2 ..which must've been administered to keep the bed sores from infecting
label2 Now, has he tried to speak or communicate in any way
label2 
label2 
label2 ..he chewed off his own tongue long ago
label2 SOMERSET: Uh, Doc
label2 Is there absolutely no chance that he might survive
label2 Detective, he'd die of shock right now if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes
label2 Give or take
label2 And he still has hell to look forward to
label2 Good night
label2 MAN [ON RADIO]: Tonight we bring you <i>the Charlie Parker Quintet.</i>  <i>Featuring Sir Charles Thompson on piano,</i> <i>Herb Pomeroy's trumpet...</i>  <i>...Jimmy Woode, bass, Kenny Clarke, drums,</i> <i>and the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker.</i>  Yeah

label2 TRACY: I mean, you know this city so well
label2 You've been here so long
label2 SOMERSET: It can be a hard place
label2 I don't know why I asked you to come
label2 Tell him how you feel
label2 I can't
label2 Especially now
label2 I'll get used to things
label2 l think I just
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 I wanted to talk to someone who's lived here for a long time and...
label2 I mean, upstate, you know, it's a completely different environment
label2 Did David tell you that I teach fifth grade
label2 Well, I did
label2 I've been going around, you know, looking at schools
label2 What about private schools
label2 I don't know
label2 Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you, Tracy
label2 David and I are gonna have a baby
label2 
label2 .
label2 I don't think I'm the, heh
label2 
label2 
label2 I'm the one to talk to about this
label2 I hate this city
label2 It was very much Iike a marriage
label2 We got pregnant
label2 This was a long time ago
label2 I remember getting up one morning and going to work
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 ..the pregnancy
label2 And l felt this fear for the first time ever
label2 I remember thinking how can I bring a child into a world like this
label2 How can
label2 How can a person grow up with all this around them
label2 And over the next few weeks
label2 .. l wore her down
label2 I wanna have children
label2 I can teIl you now that
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 I'm I know, l mean
label2 
label2 I'm positive that I made the right decision
label2 But there's not a day that passes
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 ..that l don't wish that I had made a different choice
label2 
label2 
label2 The baby, I mean, if that's your decision
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 But if you choose to have this baby
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 ..you spoil that kid every chance you get
label2 That's about all the advice I can give you, Tracy
label2 I got to go
label2 SOMERSET: Victor's landlord said there was an envelope of cash in the office mailbox
label2 ..  
label2 ..the first of every month
label2 Quote:  "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in Apartment 306
label2 And nobody ever complained about him
label2 He's the best tenant I've ever had," end quote
label2 Yeah, a landlord's dream
label2 A paralyzed tenant with no tongue
label2 Who pays the rent on time
label2 I'm sick of all this waiting
label2 Why aren't we out there, huh
label2 Why do we gotta sit here rotting, waiting till the lunatic does it again
label2 It's dismissive to call him a lunatic
label2 Don't make that mistake
label2 Look
label2 Right now he's probably dancing around in his grandma's panties
label2 Yeah, rubbing himself in peanut butter
label2 Ooh
label2 How's that
label2 His luck will run out
label2 Not depending on luck
label2 One year to the day
label2 He wanted us to
label2 Don't know that for sure
label2 This note he left
label2 His first words to us
label2 Fuck him
label2 So what
label2 Imagine the will it takes to keep a man bound for a full year
label2 To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints
label2 To insert tubes into his genitals
label2 This guy is methodical, exacting, and worst of all, patient
label2 He's a nut bag
label2 And just because the fucker's got a library card doesn't make him Yoda
label2 How much money you got
label2 50 bucks
label2 SOMERSET: I propose a field trip
label2 Come on
label2 We'll make a list
label2 Ask yourself Hey, wait, wait
label2 What are his interests now
label2 Jack the Ripper, for instance
label2 MILLS: Where are we going
label2 SOMERSET: Library
label2 MAN: Coupons, coupons, free coupons
label2 Discount Discount coupons
label2 They must've had about 50 health violations during the last inspection
label2 I don't want people thinking we're dating
label2 Give me your money
label2 I'm giving you this, but for some reason, I don't think I know what we're doing
label2 GREASY: Hey, Somerset, how you doing
label2 Okay
label2 Didn't figure this was a mÃ©nage Ã  trois
label2 Sit down
label2 Only for you do I do this, so it's a big risk
label2 So I figure we're just fair and square
label2 It's a deal
label2 AIl right
label2 Yeah, help yourself
label2 WeIl, that was money well spent
label2 All right
label2 By telling you this, l'm trusting you more than l trust most people
label2 WeIl, good, because l'm ready to punch you
label2 It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth
label2 The guy in the pizza parlor is a friend from the Bureau
label2 See, for years the FBI's been hooked into the library system, keeping records
label2 Mmhm
label2 Assessing fines
label2 No, monitoring reading habits
label2 Look
label2 Certain books are flagged
label2 Books on, say, nuclear weapons and, well, Mein Kampf
label2 ..  
label2 ..has his library records fed into the FBI's computers then on
label2 Wait, wait, wait, how is this legal
label2 Oh, legal, illegal
label2 These terms don't apply
label2 Oh
label2 It's just a useful guide
label2 It might sound silly, but you can't get a library card
label2 ..  
label2 ..without, uh, an ID and a current phone biIl, see
label2 So they run a list
label2 Precisely
label2 It could give us a name
label2 Could get a name of some college kid writing a term paper on 20thcentury crime
label2 At least you're out of the office
label2 Get a haircut
label2 I don't
label2 Neither do you
label2 Exactly
label2 <i>"The Divine Comedy.</i> <i>History of Catholicism

label2 Um, not a single one
label2 You're right, l don't
label2 Keep looking
label2 We could use some more men here
label2 What are you getting with all this
label2 And each notebook contains about 250 pages
label2 Forget it
label2 Anything about the killings
label2 "What sick ridiculous puppets we are, and what a gross stage we dance on
label2 Not a care in the world
label2 Not knowing that we are nothing
label2 We are not what was intended.
label2 No, wait, there's a lot more
label2 "On the subway today, a man came up to me to start a conversation
label2 He made small talk, a lonely man, talking about the weather and things
label2 But my head began to hurt from his banaIity
label2 I almost didn't notice it had happened, but I suddenly threw up all over him
label2 He was not pleased
label2 And l couldn't stop laughing.
label2 No dates
label2 Just his mind poured out on paper
label2 Looks like a life's work
label2 If we had 50 men reading in 24hour shifts, it'd still take two months
label2 MAN: Where's that phone
label2 Phone
label2 Phone
label2 People, quiet
label2 Hello
label2 JOHN [OVER PHONE]: I admire you

label2 JOHN: <i>You will accept my apology, won't you?</i>  <i>I feel like saying more,</i> <i>but I don't wanna ruin the surprise.</i>    JOHN [ON RECORDER]: adjusting my <i>schedule after today's little setback.</i>  Got it
label2 All right, everybody, back to work

label2 SOMERSET: Hmm

label2 These murders are his sermons to us
label2 Look, we know him, we know him, we know him

label2 Maybe
label2 She caught John Doe's eye
label2 BILL: Yeah, he came and collected it last night
label2 BILL: Yeah
label2 This man
label2 Yeah, John Doe
label2 It's an easy name to remember
label2 He had a limp
label2 What was this job you did for him
label2 Hang on
label2 I thought he was one of them performance artists, that's what I thought
label2 You know, the sort of guy that pisses in a cup on stage and, uh, then drinks it
label2 Performance art
label2 Hmm
label2 You made this for him
label2 Yeah, I've made weirder shit than that
label2 So what
label2 They found the blonde
label2 The picture
label2 OFFlCER: We need you to move, paI
label2 MAN: l'll come out, but you guys  OFFlCER: Get the fuck out of the booth
label2 I've been in this cage the whoIe time
label2 Okay

label2 We're looking for the guy
label2 You  You better see this
label2 Yeah
label2 All right
label2 Got him
label2 MAN: Get this thing off of me
label2 Oh, God, get this thing off of me
label2 Get this thing off of me
label2 Get this off
label2 Get him out of here, now
label2 MILLS: Come on, I wanna hear it again
label2 Tell me again
label2 MAN: Just I don't know
label2 You heard nothing strange, you saw nothing strange
label2 MILLS: No
label2 He asked me if I was married
label2 And l could see he had a gun in his hand
label2 Where was the girl
label2 The what
label2 What
label2 Where was she
label2 They want to go downstairs and wanna get a little ooh Ia Ia
label2 Whatever
label2 They got to come to you, yeah
label2 You didn't see anyone
label2 With a package
label2 A knapsack
label2 Something under their arm
label2 Hey, everybody that comes in there's got a package under their arms
label2 She was just sitting on the bed
label2 Who tied her down
label2 You or him
label2 Do you like what you do for a living
label2 These things you see
label2 No
label2 No, I don't
label2 He had a gun and he made it happen
label2 He made me do it
label2 He put that thing on me
label2 Then he told me to fuck her
label2 And l did
label2 l fucked her
label2 Oh, God
label2 Oh, God
label2 <i>Fuck.</i>   <i>Oh, God, God.</i>  <i>God, help me
label2 Please, please, help me.</i>  <i>Please, please, help me.</i>   You know, this isn't gonna have a happy ending
label2 It's not possibIe
label2 Hey, if we catch him, I'll be happy enough
label2 If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil  I mean, if he's Satan himself, that might live up to our expectations...  
label2 ..but he's not the devil
label2 He's just a man
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 ..see, you bitch and you compIain and you tell me these things
label2 But you gotta be a hero
label2 You wanna be a champion
label2 Let me tell you, people don't want a champion
label2 How did you get like this
label2 I wanna know
label2 Ah
label2 Go on
label2 I just don't think I can continue to live in a place that embraces and nurtures apathy
label2 
label2 
label2 ..as if it was a virtue
label2 You're no different, no better
label2 I didn't say l was different or better
label2 HelI, I sympathize
label2 I sympathize completeIy
label2 Apathy is a solution
label2 I mean, it's easier to lose yourself in drugs than it is to cope with life
label2 Yeah
label2 It's easier to steal what you want...  
label2 .than it is to earn it
label2 Yeah
label2 It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it
label2 Hell, love costs
label2 lt takes effort and work
label2 We are talking about peopIe who are mentaIly ill.  We are talking about people, fucking crazies
label2 No, we're not
label2 Yes, today
label2 We're talking about everyday life here
label2 Fuck off
label2 See, you should listen to yourself
label2 Yeah
label2 You say that the problem with people is that they don't care
label2 So l don't care about people
label2 You know why
label2 Uh, you care
label2 You wanna know
label2 Damn right
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 ..because you believe these things you say
label2 I don't
label2 You want me to agree and say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right
label2 It's all fucked up
label2 It's a fucking mess
label2 We should alI go live in a fucking log cabin.
label2 But l won't
label2 I won't say that
label2 I do not
label2 I can't
label2 I'm gonna go home
label2 I love you, honey
label2 So much
label2 TRACY: I know
label2 Could you repeat that
label2 JOHN [OVER PHONE]: <i>I've gone and done it again.</i>  What have we got
label2 Uh, sleeping pills
label2 Glued to one hand
label2 TeIephone glued to the other
label2 He sliced her up
label2 Then he bandaged her
label2 CalI for help and you'll Iive
label2 Or you can put yourself out of your own misery
label2 Come on
label2 Cut off her nose
label2 And he did it very recently
label2 SOMERSET: Listen
label2 I've decided to stay on till this is done
label2 I figure one of two things will happen
label2 We'lI get John Doe or he'll finish his series of seven and this case will go on for years
label2 MILLS: Hey man, you don't have to do me any favors
label2 Thank you, but I got it
label2 SOMERSET: I'm requesting that you keep me on as your partner for a few more days
label2 Hey, we're here
label2 SERGEANT: Wonderful
label2 Your wife called
label2 Get yourself an answering machine
label2 JOHN: Detective
label2 No big surprise
label2 JOHN: Detective
label2 You're looking for me
label2 Hey
label2 Don't you fucking move
label2 Keep away from him
label2 MILLS: On the fucking floor
label2 I know you
label2 Now
label2 Get down
label2 Get down on your stomach, you piece of shit
label2 All the way
label2 All the way, fucker
label2 Down
label2 Faster
label2 Faster, fucker
label2 Now
label2 Nose on the ground
label2 Jesus Christ
label2 I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please
label2 CAPTAIN: He cuts the skin off the tips of his fingers
label2 That's why we couldn't find one single usable print in his apartment
label2 Looks like he's been doing it for a quite sometime
label2 MILLS: What about the bank accounts
label2 The guns
label2 CAPTAIN: So far everything's a dead end
label2 No employment records
label2 His bank account's only 5 years old and it was started with cash
label2 We're even trying to trace his furniture
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 Because he's John Doe by choice
label2 Okay, so when do we get to question him
label2 CAPTAIN: You don't
label2 He going to court now
label2 I'm telling you, there's no way he'd turn himself in
label2 It doesn't make any sense
label2 Well, there he sits
label2 He's not finished
label2 No, he's pissing in our faces
label2 We're just taking it like idiots
label2 You know what l'm talking about
label2 For the first time ever, you and I are in total agreement
label2 He wouldn't just stop
label2 SOMERSET: He's two murders away from completing his masterpiece
label2 We'll wait for his plea
label2 My client says there are two more bodies
label2 He will take Detectives Mills and Somerset to these bodies
label2 
label2 
label2 ..but only Detective Mills and Somerset, only at 6:00 today
label2 Why us
label2 He says he admires you
label2 It's part of the game
label2 The client claims if the detectives do not accept this...  
label2 .these bodies will never be found
label2 Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot
label2 Hey
label2 We've got him
label2 Downstairs, locked up
label2 Done deal
label2 Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable
label2 Why are we having this conversation
label2 Mills
label2 Hey, something stinks
label2 And this one here  Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit and that smug smile on your face...  
label2 
label2 .dealing for that shit, l don't Iike it MilIs
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 .to the best of my ability
label2 To serve their best interest
label2 We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr
label2 My client wishes inform you if you do not accept...  
label2 ..he will plead insanity across the board
label2 TALBOT: Let him try it
label2 Come on, now, we alI know the extreme nature of these crimes...  
label2 .. l could get him off with such a plea
label2 I'm not letting this conviction slide
label2 I can tell you that
label2 ..he'll sign a full confession, plead guilty right now
label2 Make a decision
label2 Full confession
label2 I'm in
label2 It has to be the both of you
label2 The fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea
label2 And my client would like to remind you two more are dead
label2 Press would have a field day...  
label2 ..if they find out the police didn't seem concerned about them
label2 Giving them a proper burial
label2 If in fact there are two more dead
label2 They did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails
label2 From him slicing his fingers
label2 Blood from the woman who's face he cut off
label2 And blood from a third party, as yet unidentified
label2 You'd be escorting an unarmed man
label2 Let's finish it
label2 SOMERSET: If John Doe's head splits open and a UFO should fly out
label2 .. l want you to have expected it
label2 I will
label2 Hey, man, if l was to accidentally shave off a nipple...  
label2 Hmm
label2 I suppose so
label2 Yeah
label2 If you were man enough...  
label2 ..to actualIy file a claim, I'd buy you one out of my own pocket
label2 You know
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 Yeah
label2 ON RADlO]   ON RADlO]  Let's go
label2 PILOT [OVER RADIO]: <i>CVictor55 take
label2 Clear the TC.</i>  Pull around
label2 <i>There it is.</i> <i>Latemodel black sedan at your 10 o'clock.</i>  ON RADlO]  Who are you, John
label2 Who are you really
label2 At this stage, what harm can it do to telI us a bit about yourseif
label2 Who I am means absolutely nothing
label2 You need to stay on your left up here
label2 So where are we heading
label2 You'll see
label2 That wouldn't be shocking enough
label2 We've got newspapers to think about, yeah
label2 Wanting people to listen...  
label2 You have to hit them with a sledgehammer
label2 And then you'll notice you've got their strict attention
label2 MILLS: But the question is:  What makes you so special that people should listen
label2 I'm not special
label2 JOHN [ON RADlO]: <i>I've never been exceptional.</i>  <i>This is, though, what I'm doing.</i> <i>My work.</i>  Your work, John
label2 Yes
label2 That's not true
label2 No, it is true
label2 ..two months from now, no one's gonna care
label2 No one's gonna give a shit, no one's gonna remember
label2 You can't see the whole complete act yet
label2 But when this is done...  
label2 ..when it's finished...  
label2 ..it's going to be
label2 
label2 
label2 People will barely be able to comprehend
label2 But they won't be able to deny
label2 I mean, as far as master plans go, John  I can't wait for you to see
label2 l really can't
label2 WeIl, you know what
label2 I'm gonna be standing next to you
label2 So when this big thing happens, you be sure and let me know
label2 Because I wouldn't wanna miss it
label2 JOHN: Oh, don't worry
label2 You won't
label2 You won't miss a thing
label2 It's not too far now
label2 PILOT: <i>Hightension lines ahead.</i>  <i>Prepare for frequency change.</i>  I've been trying to figure something in my head
label2 And maybe you can help me out, yeah
label2 When a person is insane, as you clearly are
label2 
label2 
label2 ..do you know that you're insane
label2 Maybe you're sitting around, reading Guns and Ammo...  
label2 ..masturbating in your own feces, do you just stop and go:  "Wow, it is amazing how fucking crazy I really am"
label2 Do you guys do that
label2 It's more comfortable for you to label me insane
label2 It's very comfortable
label2 But l did not choose
label2 l was chosen
label2 MILLS: Well, whatever
label2 But seems to me that you're overlooking a glaring contradiction
label2 Meaning what
label2 Glad you asked
label2 ..that is, by a higher power...  
label2 ..and if your hand was forced...  
label2 ..it seems strange to me that you'd get such enjoyment out of it
label2 You enjoyed torturing those people
label2 This doesn't seem in keeping with martyrdom, does it
label2 John
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 Isn't that true
label2 How happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity
label2 That hurts my feelings
label2 I would never You wouldn't because there's consequences
label2 It's in those eyes of yours, though
label2 I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner
label2 Wait a minute, l thought all you did was kill innocent people
label2 Innocent
label2 An obese man
label2 A disgusting man who could barely stand up
label2 A man, who if you saw him whiIe you were eating.. 
label2 
label2 ..you wouldn't be able to finish your meal
label2 And after him, lawyer
label2 You must've secretly been thanking me for that one
label2 This is a man who dedicated his life...  
label2 ..to making money by lying with every breath that he could muster...  
label2 ..to keeping murderers and rapists on the streets
label2 Murderers, John, like yourself
label2 A woman...  
label2 ..so ugly inside that she couIdn't bear to go on living
label2 ..  
label2 ..if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside
label2 A drug dealer
label2 And let's not forget the diseasespreading whore
label2 OnIy in a world this shitty
label2 
label2 
label2 ..could you try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face
label2 But that's the point
label2 We see a deadly sin on every street corner.. 
label2 
label2 We tolerate it because it's common, it's
label2 ..
label2 We tolerate it morning, noon and night
label2 Well, not anymore
label2 I'm setting the example
label2 And what I've done is gonna be
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 ..and studied
label2 
label2 
label2 ..and followed
label2 
label2 
label2 ..forever
label2 Yeah
label2 You should be thanking me
label2 Why's that, John
label2 Because you're going to be remembered after this
label2 Realize, detective, the only reason that I'm here right now...  
label2 ..is that I wanted to be
label2 No
label2 Oh, really
label2 So, what were you doing, biding your time
label2 Toying with me
label2 Allowing five innocent people to die until you felt like springing your trap
label2 Tell me, what was the indisputable evidence you were going to use on me.. 
label2 
label2 John, calm down
label2 Oh, that's right
label2 And l seem to remember breaking your face
label2 You're only alive because I didn't kill you
label2 Okay, sit back
label2 I spared you
label2 Sit back
label2 Remember that every time you look in the mirror
label2 ..at that face of yours for the rest of your life...  
label2 ..or should l say for the rest...  
label2 
label2 MILLS: Sit back
label2 Shut your fucking mouth
label2 You're no messiah
label2 You're a movie of the week
label2 You're a fucking Tshirt at best
label2 I don't mourn them any more
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 ..than the thousands that died at Sodom and Gomorrah
label2 Is that to say, John, that what you were doing was God's good work
label2 Do you see those hightension towers
label2 JOHN: That's where we're headed
label2 PILOT: I see where
label2 <i>Right to your 9 o'clock</i> <i>and follow that access road.</i>  MAN: <i>Your signal's breaking up, Viking.</i>  <i>PILOT: Unfuckingavoidable, Center.</i> <i>We're in powerline city, deal with it.</i>  This sure as shit is no ambush out here

label2 They say the hurricane is coming
label2 I'm on a boat
label2 Can I do anything for you, mom
label2 Make anything easier
label2 Oh, sugar..
label2 There's nothing left to do
label2 Is what it is
label2 Finding it harder to keep my eyes open
label2 My mouth's full of cotton
label2 Do you want any more medication, mother

label2 A friend told me that she never had the chance  to say goodbye to her mother

label2 
label2 I wanted to tell you how much Iâ€™m gonna miss you so..
label2 Mom
label2 Are you afraid
label2 I'm curious
label2 What comes next
label2 My father was there the day it opened
label2 He said they had  a tuba band playing
label2 They had the finest clockmaker in all of the South  to build that glorious clock
label2 His name was...  Mr. Gateau
label2 Mr. Cake
label2 He was married to a Creole of Evangeline Parish  and they had a son
label2 Mr. Gateau was, from birth, absolutely blind
label2 When their son was old enough, he joined the army
label2 For months, he did nothing but work on that clock
label2 One day,  a letter came
label2 And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,  went up, alone, to bed
label2 And their son came home
label2 Mr. Cake worked on his clock,  laboring to finish
label2 It was a morning to remember
label2 Even Teddy Roosevelt came
label2 Itâ€™s running backwards
label2 I made it that way  so that perhaps the boys that we lost in the war  might stand and come home again
label2 Home to farm,  work,  have children
label2 To live long, full lives
label2 Perhaps my own son might come home again
label2 Mr. Cake was never seen again
label2 Some say he died of a broken heart
label2 Some say he went to sea
label2 Excuse me
label2 Do you mind if I make a call
label2 Somebody's watching my little boy
label2 Sure
label2 You couldn't disappoint me
label2 Well, I know I don't have much to show for myself
label2 Find my dark suitcase
label2 This
label2 Could you read it to me
label2 I tried to read it a hundred different times
label2 Mom, it's not exactly

label2 Iâ€™ll be right there, Miss Jameson
label2 Now, Queenie, now come on
label2 Itâ€™s awful nice out here
label2 Come on out back for a moment
label2 Take your mind off things
label2 You're so bad
label2 What in God's name
label2 What's this
label2 Hope I didn't hurt it none stepping on it like that
label2 We best leave that for the police
label2 Iâ€™ll go
label2 Itâ€™s for sure nobody wanted to keep it
label2 Come on, baby
label2 Where are you, Queenie
label2 Hold your water
label2 You go deal with it
label2 Okay
label2 Queenie, Apple, she went and messed herself all over again
label2 Jane Childress, start her a bath
label2 And mind your own business, Mrs. Duprey
label2 Somebody stole my necklace
label2 Okay
label2 All right, Mrs. Hollister, Iâ€™ll be right with you, okay
label2 Go on back upstairs, hear
label2 You are as ugly as an old pot  but you're still a child of God
label2 Queenie, Apple, she won't take a bath without you
label2 Mercy
label2 Iâ€™ll be right there
label2 You just wait right here for me now, okay
label2 My sister gave me those pearls
label2 I can't find them anywhere
label2 Somebody's been stealing my jewelry
label2 See
label2 Right around your pretty white neck
label2 Hush all that noise
label2 Is Dr. Rose still here
label2 I don't know
label2 Your heart is strong
label2 I trust you ladies will help me out with that
label2 I have something
label2 Could you come downstairs
label2 Never seen anything like it
label2 Nearly blind from cataracts
label2 His bones indicate severe arthritis
label2 His skin has lost all elasticity, and his hands and feet are ossified
label2 He's dying
label2 His body is failing him before his life's begun
label2 Where'd he come from
label2 My sister's child
label2 From Lafayette
label2 The poor child, he got the worst of it
label2 Come out white
label2 There are places for unwanted babies like these, Queenie
label2 No room for another mouth to feed here
label2 The Nolan Foundation, despite their good intentions,  thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is
label2 
label2 
label2 You said he don't have long
label2 No, this baby, he is a miracle
label2 That's for certain
label2 Yâ€™all listen
label2 Yâ€™all listen up here
label2 We're gonna have us a visitor  that's gonna be staying with us for a little while
label2 My sister had a child and she couldn't see right by it, so
label2 
label2 He's known as
label2 
label2 
label2 Benjamin
label2 He's not a well child, so we're gonna have to take good care of him
label2 I had 1 0 children
label2 Let me see him
label2 God in Heaven
label2 He looks just like my exhusband
label2 Look, he's prematurely old
label2 Join the club
label2 He's smiling
label2 Hambert sends his remembrances to you
label2 Are you right out of your mind
label2 It may not even be humankind
label2 Mr. Weathers, come back here
label2 Please
label2 It seemed I had found a home
label2 Is any of this true
label2 Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token
label2 That clock just kept going,  year after year after year
label2 But I didn't know I was a child
label2 Same old crap every day
label2 I thought I was like everyone else there
label2 An old man in the twilight of his life
label2 Could you make him stop that
label2 Itâ€™s used for eating, not for playing with
label2 And use your napkin, please, Mr. Benjamin
label2 Hey, boy
label2 Always had a healthy curiosity
label2 What was up the street
label2 Go get him
label2 Benjamin
label2 That is dangerous
label2 Come back over here
label2 Stay put, child
label2 I loved her very much
label2 She was my mother
label2 Some days I feel different than the day before
label2 Everybody feels different about themselves, one way or another
label2 Just taking different roads to get there, that's all
label2 You're on your own road, Benjamin
label2 Mama
label2 Just be thankful for what you're given, hear
label2 You're already here longer than you're supposed to
label2 Some nights, Iâ€™d have to sleep alone
label2 I didn't mind
label2 I would listen to the house breathing
label2 All those people sleeping
label2 It was a place of great routine
label2 Every morning at 5:30, no matter the weather,  General Winslow, U. S. Army, Retired, would raise the flag
label2 Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once an opera singer of some note,  well, she sang Wagner
label2 All right, baby, come on
label2 We got to put some life into these old sticks for you
label2 Get you walking so you can help me out around here
label2 Molasses
label2 I learned to read when I was five
label2 My grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor
label2 He brung home every play for me to read
label2 "Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,  "Let dying Mortimer here rest himself
label2 "Even like a man new haled from the rack,  "So fare my limbs with long imprisonment
label2 You thought I was plain ignorant, didn't you
label2 The actor my grandfather worked for was John Wilkes Booth
label2 He killed Abraham Lincoln
label2 On Saturday nights, Mama would make me go to church
label2 Benjamin
label2 Amen
label2 Amen
label2 Amen
label2 Amen
label2 What can I do for you, sister
label2 Lord, if you could see clear to forgive this woman her sins  so she can bear the fruit of the womb
label2 Out, damnable affliction
label2 Praise God
label2 Hallelujah
label2 Hallelujah
label2 And what's this old man's irrediction
label2 He's got the Devil on his back,  trying to ride him into the grave before his time
label2 Out, Zebuchar
label2 Yes
label2 Out, Beelzebub
label2 Yes
label2 Seven
label2 God bless you
label2 He's seven
label2 Now, this is a man with optimism in his heart
label2 All right
label2 Belief in his soul
label2 Yes
label2 Yes
label2 Yes
label2 Hallelujah
label2 We are gonna get you out of that chair
label2 And we're gonna have you walk
label2 Amen
label2 In the name of God's glory
label2 
label2 Rise up
label2 Come on
label2 Come on
label2 Walk
label2 Come on, son
label2 Come on with it, son
label2 Come on
label2 Come on
label2 Now God is gonna see you the rest of the way
label2 He's gonna see this little old man walk without the use of a crutch or a cane
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 .and divine inspiration alone
label2 Hey, Ben
label2 Go, son
label2 Now walk
label2 Yes
label2 Come on
label2 Rise up, old man
label2 Rise up like Lazarus
label2 Hallelujah
label2 Yes
label2 Come on
label2 Say hallelujah
label2 Hallelujah
label2 Hallelujah
label2 Walk
label2 Yes
label2 Now when I look back on it, it was miraculous
label2 But you know the saying, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away
label2 Glory in the highest
label2 Sweet Jesus
label2 No
label2 No
label2 There were so many birthdays
label2 So we wouldn't run out, we would spare the candles
label2 Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays and I don't like cake
label2 And death was a common visitor
label2 People came and went
label2 There was a silence in the house
label2 It was a wonderful place to grow up
label2 I was with people who had shed ail the inconsequences of earlier life
label2 Left wondering about the weather, the temperature of a bath,  the light at the end of a day
label2 For everyone that died, someone would come to take their place
label2 My fifth wife and I are captured by a neighbor tribe of cannibals
label2 Oh, goodness gracious
label2 My wife, she can't swim, so, sadly, she eaten
label2 Oh, my God
label2 My second wife steps on cobra and dies
label2 That's Mr. Oti
label2 He's an acquaintance of an acquaintance of mine
label2 The next summer Iâ€™m captured
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 
label2 .with three others by the Baschiele tribe
label2 They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer to a very strange American man
label2 I hear you're not so old as you're looking
label2 You just fooling everybody
label2 Did you get Madjembe
label2 Worms
label2 I don't think I have worms
label2 This is just how I am
label2 Did you take your pills today
label2 No, ma'am
label2 Let's get a cold root beer
label2 I found the medication under your pillow
label2 Iâ€™m not supposed to
label2 Itâ€™s dangerous
label2 Come on, little man
label2 Hello, children
label2 Then Iâ€™m in the monkey house at Philadelphia Zoological Park
label2 Three thousand people show up my first day
label2 Look
label2 What's it like living in a cage
label2 But the monkeys
label2 They do some tricks there
label2 I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali
label2 She is orangutan
label2 When Iâ€™m not playing with the monkeys, they want me to run to the bars  in my cage, with my teeth
label2 So then what'd you do
label2 Then I leave zoo, go here, go there
label2 You were all alone
label2 Plenty of time youâ€™ll be alone
label2 When you're different like us, it's gonna be that way
label2 But Iâ€™ll tell you a little secret
label2 Fat people, skinny people, tall people,  white people, they're just as alone as we are
label2 It would be nice to sit by my river again
label2 Come, I have an appointment
label2 There's my little man
label2 You ready, sugar
label2 Always ready
label2 Always ready
label2 Filamena, Mr. Benjamin
label2 Itâ€™s a pleasure to meet you, sir
label2 You can find your own way home, can't you
label2 Hey
label2 Hey
label2 Where in God's name have you been
label2 Get in here
label2 I mean, you take my breath away, you know that
label2 It had been the best day of my life
label2 How's her breathing
label2 Itâ€™s shallow
label2 They say itâ€™ll reach us in a few hours,  so I gotta get my baby and take him to my sister's
label2 They say there's nothing to worry about here in the hospital
label2 Are you okay
label2 Yeah, Iâ€™m okay reading
label2 I shouldn't be more than an hour
label2 It was just Dorothy leaving
label2 Go on, Caroline
label2 "On Sundays, the families would come and visit.
label2 It was Thanksgiving, 1 930
label2 I met the person who changed my life forever
label2 Well, Benjamin
label2 Good day, Mrs. Fuller
label2 What elixir have you been drinking
label2 Thank you, ma'am
label2 Grandma
label2 Look at me
label2 That was really something
label2 Come on over here, you
label2 Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy
label2 
label2 Iâ€™m afraid, Benjamin, I don't rightly know your last name
label2 Benjamin's fine
label2 Good people, supper is served
label2 For everything thy goodness sends
label2 Amen
label2 Amen
label2 Amen
label2 Did you know turkeys aren't really birds
label2 They're in the pheasant family, can't hardly fly
label2 Itâ€™s sad, don't you think
label2 Birds that can't fly
label2 I love birds that can't fly
label2 They are so delicious
label2 That's terrible
label2 I have something to telic y'all  while we're giving thanks for God's blessings
label2 The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers
label2 What does she mean, answered her prayers
label2 Thanks
label2 She's gonna have a baby, silly
label2 That's what my mama said when I was gonna have a baby brother,  but he didn't live long,  'cause he didn't breathe right
label2 "You can see that it is 5:00,  "because Big God Nqong's clock says so.
label2 Isn't that something
label2 Again, read it again
label2 Oh, read it again, please
label2 All right
label2 But afterwards, you must go to bed
label2 I promise
label2 Are you sleeping
label2 Who's that
label2 Oh, hi
label2 'Kay, come on
label2 Come on
label2 Under here
label2 Here, you light it
label2 Iâ€™m not supposed to play with matches
label2 Don't be a chicken
label2 Iâ€™ll telic you a secret if youâ€™ll telic me one
label2 Okay
label2 I saw my mama kissing another man
label2 Her face was red from it
label2 Your turn
label2 I thought so
label2 You don't seem like an old person
label2 Iâ€™m not
label2 Are you sick
label2 Well, I heard Mama and Tizzy whispering
label2 They said I was gonna die soon, but maybe not
label2 You're odd
label2 May l
label2 Okay
label2 What are you doing under there
label2 Itâ€™s after midnight
label2 You are not to be playing together
label2 Yes, ma'am
label2 Now you get back to bed, little lady
label2 And you ought to be ashamed of yourself
label2 You are a different child
label2 A manchild
label2 And, baby, people aren't gonna understand just how different you are
label2 What's wrong with me, Mama
label2 Come here
label2 Now go on to bed, hear
label2 And behave yourself
label2 Go on
label2 Say your prayers, hear
label2 Did I ever telic you Iâ€™ve been struck by lightning seven times
label2 Once I was just crossing the road to get the mail
label2 I never forgot her...  "
label2 
label2 blue eyes.
label2 Mom
label2 Did you get that this Benjamin loved you from the first time that he saw you
label2 Want me to go on
label2 He crosses something out
label2 When that baby came, things were different
label2 Your mama gone away And your daddy gonna stay  Didn't leave nobody but the baby  Babies were born, people died
label2 Iâ€™ve come to say goodbye
label2 Iâ€™m going away
label2 Going
label2 I haven't figured that out yet,  but Iâ€™ll send you a postcard when I get there
label2 What about your friend, the tall lady
label2 We are not friends anymore
label2 That's what happens with tall people sometimes
label2 Well, goodbye
label2 Spent a lot of time by myself that year
label2 Hello
label2 Hi
label2 Welcome
label2 We've been expecting you
label2 Can you please show her up to Mrs. Rousseau's old room
label2 Well, she's old as the hills
label2 She's almost blind
label2 She won't be a bother much longer
label2 Well, all right, long as she stays from up underfoot
label2 As hard as I try, I can't remember her name
label2 Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford
label2 Maybe it was Maple
label2 Itâ€™s funny how sometimes the people we remember the least  make the greatest impression on us
label2 And she always dressed in fine clothing, as if she was going out
label2 She taught me to play the piano
label2 Itâ€™s not about how well you play
label2 Itâ€™s how you feel about what you're playing
label2 Try this
label2 You can't help putting yourself in the music
label2 There were many changes
label2 Some you could see, some you couldn't
label2 Hair had started growing in all sorts of places,  along with other things
label2 Darling, the pain
label2 All right, Mom, Iâ€™ll get the nurse
label2 This is a major hurricane,  a slow hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of...  Not doing too good
label2 Nobody seems to know whether to stay or leave
label2 Iâ€™m gonna ride it out
label2 There
label2 That should make things much easier
label2 My father waited four hours for my brother to get here from Boger City
label2 Couldn't go without him
label2 She seems like a sweet woman
label2 I haven't had as much time with her as I would've
label2 
label2 
label2 I could use your help
label2 Excuse me
label2 Sure
label2 
label2 .
label2 ...to Poverty Point to watch the boats go up and down the river
label2 These were hard times
label2 Did I ever telic you I was struck by lightning seven times
label2 Once when I was in the field, just tending to my cows
label2 My fourth hand didn't show up
label2 What's the matter
label2 He never pays
label2 Nobody wants a job
label2 I do
label2 You got your sea legs about you, old man
label2 I think
label2 Get your ass on board
label2 Weâ€™ll sure as hell find out
label2 I was as happy as I could be
label2 I need a volunteer
label2 Yes, Captain
label2 Scrape off all this bird shit
label2 Right away, sir
label2 And I was actually gonna be paid for something I would've done for free
label2 His name was Captain Mike Clark
label2 Get moving, then
label2 Come here
label2 Can you still get it up
label2 The old pole, huh
label2 The high, hard one
label2 I guess
label2 When was the last time you had a woman
label2 Never
label2 Not that I know of, sir
label2 Wait a minute, now
label2 You mean to say you've been on this earth however many years  and you've never had a woman
label2 Damn, that's the saddest thing Iâ€™ve ever heard in my life
label2 Never
label2 No
label2 What did your father do
label2 I never met my father
label2 You lucky bastard
label2 Out on my father's boat, workin' the twoaday,  this little, fat bastard
label2 Anyway, I finally work up the nerve and telic him,  "I don't want to spend the rest of my life on a goddamn tugboat.
label2 You know what Iâ€™m saying
label2 You don't want to spend the rest of your life on a tugboat
label2 Absolutely
label2 Damn right
label2 So you know what my father says to me
label2 "What the hell do you think you can do?
label2 So I telic him
label2 "Well, if you're asking,  "I want to be an artist.
label2 He laughs
label2 "An artist
label2 "And that's exactly what you're gonna do.
label2 Well, I turned myself into an artist
label2 A tattoo artist
label2 I put on every one of these myself
label2 You have to skin me alive to take my art away from me now
label2 That one
label2 You gotta do what you're meant to do
label2 And I happen to be a goddamned artist
label2 But you're a tugboat captain
label2 Captain Mike
label2 We're ready for you and your friend
label2 Let's go, old timer, eh
label2 Break your cherry
label2 Hey, Captain
label2 Hi, Captain
label2 Hi
label2 Hi
label2 He gives me the willies
label2 That is not for me
label2 It was a night to remember
label2 What are you, Dick Tracy or something
label2 Iâ€™ve got to rest
label2 Again
label2 No, thank you
label2 You have a nice night
label2 Will you be here tomorrow
label2 Every night but Sunday
label2 Good night, sweetie
label2 Come back now
label2 Things money can buy you
label2 Can I offer you a ride somewhere
label2 Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir
label2 My name is Thomas, Thomas Button
label2 Iâ€™m Benjamin
label2 Benjamin
label2 Itâ€™s a pleasure to know you
label2 Would you like to stop somewhere and have a drink
label2 Evening, Mr. Button
label2 Whatâ€™ll it be, sir
label2 Iâ€™ll have whatever he's having
label2 With whiskey, not brandy
label2 You don't drink, do you
label2 Itâ€™s a night for firsts
label2 How's that
label2 Iâ€™ve never been to a brothel, either
label2 It certainly is
label2 True enough
label2 Your drinks
label2 I don't mean to be rude, but your hands
label2 Is that painful
label2 What kind of disease
label2 I was born old
label2 Iâ€™m sorry
label2 No need to be
label2 There's nothing wrong with old age
label2 Iâ€™m so, so sorry
label2 She died in childbirth
label2 To mothers
label2 What line of work you in, Mr. Button
label2 Buttons
label2 Button's Buttons
label2 There isn't a button that we don't make
label2 Would you gentlemen like anything else
label2 One for the road, Benjamin
label2 Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button
label2 So, what line of work do you do
label2 Iâ€™m a tugboat man
label2 I enjoyed drinking with you
label2 Benjamin
label2 Would you mind if, time to time, I stopped by and said hello
label2 Good night, Mr. Button
label2 Good night, Benjamin
label2 Drive on
label2 Where have you been
label2 Nothing
label2 I met some people and listened to some music
label2 Oh, sweet Jesus, boy
label2 Sneaks up on you
label2 One person is there, then suddenly somebody else has taken her place
label2 She wasn't all elbows and knees anymore
label2 Benjamin
label2 I loved those weekends when she'd come  and spend the night with her grandmother
label2 Daisy
label2 Daisy
label2 You want to see something
label2 You gotta keep it a secret, so get dressed
label2 Iâ€™ll meet you out back
label2 Come on
label2 I can do anything you can do
label2 We gotta hurry
label2 Is he okay
label2 Captain
label2 Captain Mike
label2 Morning, Captain
label2 Can you take us out
label2 Do you know what day it is
label2 Do you know what that means
label2 Means I was very drunk last night
label2 Well, you're drunk every night
label2 Close friend
label2 I want to show her the river
label2 You're not supposed to go joyriding with civilians
label2 What are you waiting for
label2 Pulled in for repair a wounded duck
label2 She's flying now, huh
label2 Ahoy, sailor
label2 Did you say something, Mom
label2 Itâ€™s getting really bad
label2 Can you hear me, Mom
label2 Time just seeped out of me
label2 "Things were changing quickly.
label2 What if I told you that I wasn't getting older,  but I was getting younger than everybody else
label2 Well, I'd feel sorry for you,  to have to see everybody you love die before you do
label2 Iâ€™d never thought about life or death that way before
label2 Benjamin, we're meant to lose the people we love
label2 How else would we know how important they are to us
label2 And one fall day, a familiar visitor came knocking on our door
label2 She taught me how to play the piano
label2 Amen
label2 Amen
label2 And she taught me what it meant to miss somebody
label2 Let's go
label2 Iâ€™d had my first drink
label2 Said goodbye to one friend and buried another
label2 In 1 936, when I was coming to the end of the 1 7th year of my life,  I packed my bag, said goodbye
label2 Bye, Benjamin
label2 Goodbye
label2 I knew, life being what it was, Iâ€™d probably never see them again
label2 Good luck to you, son
label2 I love you, Mama
label2 I love you, too, baby
label2 I want you to say your prayers every night, hear
label2 Be safe, hear
label2 Where you going
label2 To sea
label2 Iâ€™ll send you a postcard
label2 From everywhere
label2 Write me a postcard from everywhere
label2 He sent me a postcard from everywhere he went
label2 Every place he worked
label2 Newfoundland
label2 Baffin Bay
label2 Glasgow
label2 Narvik
label2 He had gone with that Captain Mike
label2 Captain Mike had contracted for three years  with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage
label2 The old ship had been refitted with a diesel engine and a new sea winch
label2 We went around Florida and up the Atlantic seaboard
label2 Captain Mike and me
label2 Cookie, Prentiss Mayes from Wilmington, Delaware
label2 The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,  who got along fine at sea but, for some reason,  once they were on dry land couldn't stand the sight of each other
label2 You know, one in every eight boats never returns
label2 All hands lost at sea
label2 From Belvedere, South Dakota
label2 Never said a word to anyone, except himself
label2 I wrote him constantly
label2 I told him I had been invited to audition in New York City  for the School of American Ballet
label2 Please stay
label2 Thank you
label2 Thank you
label2 You can stay
label2 Another dancing gypsy
label2 How is it when you showed up  you were no bigger than a bollard with one foot in the grave,  but now, either I drink a hell of a lot more than I think I do,  or you sprouted
label2 What's your secret
label2 Well, Captain,  you do drink a lot
label2 We stayed in a small hotel with a grand name, The Winter Palace
label2 You have no idea what you're talking about
label2 Its heart rate's 1 ,200 beats per minute
label2 Its wings beat 80 times a second
label2 lf you was to stop their wings from beating,  it would be dead in less than 1 0 seconds
label2 This is no ordinary bird
label2 This is a frickin' miracle
label2 They slowed down their wings with moving pictures,  and you know what they saw
label2 You know what the figure eight is the mathematical symbol for
label2 Infinity
label2 Infinity
label2 Everybody, no matter what differences they had,  the languages, the color of their skin, had one thing in common
label2 Three, please
label2 Could you hold, dear, for us, please
label2 Good evening
label2 Her name was Elizabeth Abbott
label2 She was plain as paper
label2 But she was pretty as any picture to me
label2 What are you looking at
label2 lf you must know, we have a longstanding agreement  never to go to bed sober
label2 Isn't that right, darling
label2 Whatever you say, darling
label2 Her husband was Walter Abbott
label2 Darling
label2 Oh, thank you, my darling
label2 Oh, yes
label2 I broke my heel off one of my shoes
label2 Iâ€™m not in the habit of walking about in my stocking feet
label2 They were long days there
label2 One particular night, I was having trouble sleeping
label2 Iâ€™m sorry
label2 I couldn't sleep
label2 I was gonna make some tea
label2 Would you like some
label2 Oh, no
label2 Milk
label2 Honey
label2 I hope you like flies in your honey
label2 Oh, perhaps not
label2 Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little
label2 Steep
label2 Soak
label2 I don't know, I mean, there's a proper way of making tea
label2 Well, where Iâ€™m from, people just want it to be hot
label2 Now, you're a seaman
label2 A sailor
label2 There's no age limit, as long as you can do the work
label2 And you have trouble sleeping
label2 Thank you
label2 I didn't think I did
label2 Something's been keeping me up
label2 My father, in his 80s,  he was so convinced he was gonna die in his sleep,  he limited himself to having afternoon naps
label2 He was so determined he was gonna cheat death
label2 Did he
label2 Did he what
label2 He died sitting in his favorite chair  listening to his favorite program on the wireless
label2 He must have known something
label2 My husband's the British Trade Minister, and we've been here for 1 4 months
label2 We were supposed to go to Peking  but it never seemed to work out
label2 Have you been in the Far East
label2 No
label2 Iâ€™ve never been anywhere, really
label2 I mean, outside of harbors
label2 And where is it that you're from
label2 Louisiana
label2 I didn't know there was another
label2 And she told me about all the places she had been, and what she had seen
label2 Iâ€™m just a lush, myself
label2 And we went back to our rooms, to our separate lives
label2 But every night, we'd meet again in that lobby
label2 A mouse running, and stopping
label2 A radiator hissing
label2 A curtain blowing
label2 There's something peaceful, even comforting  knowing that the people you love are asleep in their beds  where nothing can harm them
label2 Elizabeth and I would lose track of the night  until just before daybreak
label2 I think I may have given you the wrong impression
label2 Well, married women don't customarily sit around  in the middle of the night with strange men in hotels
label2 I wouldn't know what a married woman does or doesn't do
label2 Good night
label2 "Iâ€™ve met somebody, and Iâ€™ve fallen in love.
label2 Mom
label2 That was over 60 years ago
label2 Did you love him, Mother
label2 Well
label2 
label2 Iâ€™m not dressed
label2 Oh, you look splendid, just as you are
label2 Don't waste any time bothering about the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,  'cause they're really completely ordinary,  but the caviar and the vodka  are sublime and plentiful
label2 So
label2 And don't eat it all at once,  because that way, there's nothing left to enjoy
label2 And now, take a little swallow of vodka while it's still in your mouth
label2 You haven't been with many women, have you
label2 Not on Sundays
label2 No, ma'am
label2 When I was 1 9,  I attempted to become the first woman ever to swim the English Channel
label2 Really
label2 I was in the water for 32 hours
label2 And when I was two miles from Calais,  it started to rain
label2 That's it
label2 Steady on
label2 When I couldn't go any further,  I stopped
label2 I just stopped
label2 And everybody asked me, would I try again
label2 For why wouldn't l
label2 As a matter of fact, Iâ€™ve never done anything with my life after that
label2 Your hands are so coarse
label2 I can feel the wind in your cheek
label2 Iâ€™m afraid it's the witching hour
label2 Itâ€™s something you never forget
label2 You make me feel years younger, too
label2 I wish I was
label2 So many things Iâ€™d change
label2 Iâ€™d undo all my mistakes
label2 What mistakes
label2 I kept waiting, you know
label2 Thinking that Iâ€™d do something to change my circumstances
label2 Such an awful waste
label2 Wasted time
label2 lf we're going to have an affair,  you're never to look at me during the day
label2 And we're always to part before sunrise
label2 And we will never say "I love you.
label2 Are you cold
label2 Iâ€™m freezing
label2 Oh, you
label2 You're frozen
label2 What an idiot, Iâ€™m standing here in this fur
label2 She was the first woman that ever loved me
label2 You want me to skip some
label2 No, Iâ€™m glad he had somebody to keep him warm
label2 "I couldn't wait to see her again.
label2 We saw each other every night
label2 We always used the same room
label2 Elizabeth
label2 Good night
label2 Until one night
label2 Yesterday, December 7th, 1 941 ,  a date which will live in infamy...  Itâ€™s a meeting, a policy meeting regarding your future,  possibly beyond
label2 As you may or may not know,  the Japs bombed Pearl Harbor yesterday
label2 Frank D. Rooseveltâ€™s asked each of us to do our part
label2 The Chelsea's been commissioned to serve in the United States Navy
label2 To repair, to salvage, and to rescue
label2 Anybody doesn't want to go to war, now is the time to say so
label2 Yeah, Iâ€™ve been meaning to talk with you, Mike
label2 My wife's doing poorly
label2 Iâ€™d like to maybe see her one more time
label2 You're free to make your way home any way you can, Mr. Mayes
label2 Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook
label2 Food poisoning's one of the leading causes of death at sea
label2 I can cook, Captain
label2 Been doing it all my life
label2 I don't know
label2 You're a little moody for war, Benjamin
label2 Iâ€™ll take any man wants to kick the shite out of the Japs and the Huns
label2 That's it, pack your gear
label2 She had left a note
label2 She wrote, "It was nice to have met you.
label2 And that was it
label2 We would just tow crippled ships, scraps of metal, really
label2 lf there was a war, we didn't see it
label2 There was a man assigned to us
label2 The Chief Gunner loved the Navy
label2 But most of all, he loved America
label2 There is no other country in the world
label2 When you spell America
label2 
label2 His family had been Americans for over 500 years
label2 These pacifists
label2 They say they won't fight on conscience
label2 Now, where would be if everybody decided to act  according to their conscience
label2 Keep it down, would you, Chief
label2 Hey
label2 You seem trustworthy
label2 lf something happens to me,  could you see that this gets to my wife
label2 He'd given me all of his pay
label2 Hadn't spent a dime of it
label2 I want my family to know I was thinking about them
label2 Get your asses up here, you lazy bastards
label2 The war had finally found us
label2 Pleasant, man that light
label2 A transport carrying 1 ,300 men had been split by a torpedo
label2 We were first to arrive at the scene
label2 Cut the engines
label2 All stop
label2 We were the only sound
label2 Fellas
label2 We sure as hell can't outrun them fuckers
label2 Battle stations
label2 What
label2 Is that the last one
label2 Captain
label2 They shot the hell out of my painting
label2 Youâ€™ll be all right, Captain
label2 They got a nice spot in Heaven waiting for you
label2 Nice spot
label2 You can be as mad as a mad dog at the way things went
label2 But when it comes to the end,  you have to let go
label2 Captain
label2 Thirteen hundred and twenty eight men died that day
label2 I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis Smith
label2 John Grimm, who was right, he was gonna die there
label2 I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody,  and to Mike Clark, captain of the tugboat Chelsea
label2 I said goodbye to all the other men who had dreams of their own,  ail the men who wanted to be insurance salesmen  or doctors or lawyers or lndian chiefs
label2 This don't get fixed
label2 Iâ€™d never seen a hummingbird that far out to sea
label2 Before or since
label2 And in May of 1 945, when I was 26 years old,  I came home
label2 Iâ€™m ready
label2 Iâ€™m coming
label2 Iâ€™m ready
label2 All right, Iâ€™m coming, Miss Alfalina
label2 Queenie
label2 Sweet Jesus
label2 Oh, you're home
label2 Oh, Lord, you came back
label2 Let me look at you
label2 Child, it's your brother, Benjamin
label2 I didn't know he was my brother
label2 There's a shitload of things you don't know, child
label2 Get on out there and finish sweeping
label2 Go on, now
label2 Turn around
label2 You look like you've been born again
label2 Younger than the springtime
label2 I knew it that moment I saw you, you were special
label2 I telic you what, my knees are sore,  'cause Iâ€™ve been on them every night asking the Lord,  I said, "God, just bring him home safely.
label2 Remember what I told you
label2 "You never know what's coming for you?
label2 That's right
label2 Sit down
label2 I sure saw some things
label2 Oh, you seen some pain
label2 Some joy, too
label2 Sure, I did
label2 Look at you
label2 Where's Tizzy
label2 Oh, baby
label2 Mr. Weathers died in his sleep one night last April
label2 Mama, Iâ€™m so sorry
label2 Don't you worry about that, baby
label2 They all just about new
label2 Guess they're waiting their turn like everybody else, huh
label2 Now, we're gonna have to find you a wife and a new job
label2 That's right
label2 Come on in here, help me with this table
label2 Benjamin
label2 She's stone deaf
label2 Oh, and youâ€™ll be staying in what was Mrs. DeSeroux's old room
label2 You're too big to be rooming with anybody else
label2 Itâ€™s a funny thing about coming home
label2 Did I ever telic you Iâ€™ve been struck by lightning seven times
label2 Once when I was sitting in my truck, just minding my own business
label2 You realize what's changed is you
label2 And late one morning, not long after Iâ€™d been back..
label2 Hey
label2 Excuse me, is Queenie here
label2 Daisy
label2 Itâ€™s me, Benjamin
label2 Benjamin
label2 Oh, my God
label2 Of course it's you
label2 How are you
label2 Itâ€™s been such a long time
label2 When did you get back
label2 Well, I got back a few weeks ago
label2 I spoke to Queenie, she said you were in the war, somewhere at sea
label2 We were so, so worried about you
label2 Oh, Iâ€™m okay
label2 Well, look at you
label2 You're so lovely
label2 And a woman had taken her place
label2 "She was the most beautiful woman Iâ€™d ever seen.
label2 Beautiful
label2 "The most beautiful.
label2 You remember Grandma Fuller
label2 Why, sure I do
label2 She passed
label2 Iâ€™m sorry
label2 I just can't believe we're both here
label2 Must be fate
label2 No, no, what do they call it
label2 Kismet
label2 I don't believe l. 
label2 He says that everything is predetermined,  but I like to think of it as fate
label2 Iâ€™m not sure how it works, but Iâ€™m glad it happened
label2 Have you been to Manhattan
label2 Itâ€™s right across the river from me
label2 Now, I can see the Empire State Building  if I stand on my bed
label2 Where have you been
label2 Tell me everything
label2 Last time you wrote, you said you'd been to Russia
label2 Iâ€™ve always wanted to go to Russia
label2 Twice as cold
label2 My goodness
label2 We always said you were different
label2 You wrote that you met somebody
label2 Did it work out
label2 It ran its course
label2 Hey, do you remember this
label2 "This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo  "at 5:00 in the afternoon.
label2 Would you like to have dinner
label2 Did I telic you that I danced for Balanchine
label2 He said that I had perfect line
label2 And he just..
label2 He just put it right into the production
label2 I mean, can you imagine that
label2 Like in a..
label2 In a classical ballet
label2 You know, a dancer, intentionally falling
label2 There's a whole new word for dance now
label2 No, he's not the only one, though
label2 There's Lincoln Kirstein and Lucia Chase, and oh, my...  Oh, there's Agnes de Mille
label2 Itâ€™s not about the formality of the dance, it's about what the dancer's feeling
label2 As she told me about this big new world,  names that didn't mean a thing to me,  I didn't really hear very much of what she was saying
label2 Itâ€™s new and it's modern and it's American
label2 They understand our vigor and our physicality
label2 Iâ€™ve just been talking and talking
label2 No, no, Iâ€™ve enjoyed listening
label2 I didn't know you smoked
label2 Iâ€™m old enough
label2 Iâ€™m old enough for a lot of things
label2 In New York, we stay up all night,  watch the sun come up over the warehouses
label2 I have to go back tomorrow
label2 So soon
label2 Wish I could stay
label2 Dancers don't need costumes or scenery anymore
label2 Lawrence
label2 Well
label2 
label2 
label2 His books were banned
label2 The words are like making love
label2 Sex is a part of it
label2 You know, a lot of the dancers are lesbians
label2 There was one woman who wanted to sleep with me
label2 Does that upset you
label2 Somebody wanting to sleep with me
label2 You're a desirable woman
label2 I would think most of them would want to sleep with you
label2 Let's go back to the house
label2 Or we could get a room somewhere
label2 I don't know, Daisy
label2 Itâ€™s not that I wouldn't like to or anything
label2 I think Iâ€™ll just disappoint you
label2 Oh, Benjamin, Iâ€™ve been with older men
label2 You should be with your friends
label2 You're only young once
label2 Oh, Iâ€™m old enough
label2 Daisy, just not tonight, is all
label2 We could go hear some music
label2 You look so handsome and so distinguished
label2 They're saying the hurricane's gonna miss us, blow right on by
label2 Oh, that's great
label2 Iâ€™ll stay under the blankets with Mother
label2 She says nothing
label2 
label2 Benjamin
label2 "Things were becoming different
label2 
label2 ...for me
label2 My hair had very little gray and grew like weeds
label2 My sense of smell was keener
label2 My hearing, more acute
label2 I could walk further and faster
label2 Come in
label2 Benjamin
label2 Do you remember me
label2 Well, sure I do, Mr. Button
label2 What happened to you
label2 Got infected, so
label2 
label2 
label2 Welcome home, my friend
label2 I see you're still drinking your Sazerac with whiskey
label2 You still visiting the house on Bourbon Street
label2 Not for a long time
label2 Interesting times, though
label2 We went from making 40,000 to nearly half a million buttons a day
label2 We were operating around the clock
label2 Damn shame
label2 The war has been kind to the button industry
label2 I don't know how much longer I have
label2 No
label2 
label2 
label2 I don't have any people
label2 I keep to myself
label2 I hope you don't mind, but, whenever possible,  Iâ€™d enjoy your company
label2 Iâ€™ll certainly do what I can
label2 Now, Button's Buttons has been in our family for 1 24 years
label2 My grandfather was a tailor, and he had a small shop in Richmond
label2 So, with his help, the tailor shop grew to this
label2 And today, I can't sew a stitch
label2 That's very, very interesting
label2 You sure have done well for yourself
label2 Benjamin
label2 You're my son
label2 Iâ€™m so sorry I never told you before
label2 You were born the night the Great War ended
label2 I thought you were a monster
label2 I promised your mother Iâ€™d make sure you were safe
label2 I should never have abandoned you
label2 My mother
label2 At the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain
label2 When I was a boy, Iâ€™d love to wake up before anyone else,  run down to that lake and watch the day begin
label2 I fell in love the first time I saw her
label2 Your mother's name was Caroline Murphy
label2 She worked in your grandfather's kitchen
label2 She's from Dublin
label2 In 1 903, Caroline and all her brothers and sisters came to live here,  in New Orleans
label2 Happiest day of my life
label2 The day I married your mother
label2 Why didn't you just telic me
label2 I plan on leaving everything I have to you
label2 I have to go
label2 Where
label2 Home
label2 He thinks he can just show up  and everything's supposed to be fine and dandy
label2 Well, he got another thing coming, that's for sure
label2 God be my witness, he got another thing coming
label2 He left us $1 8 that night you was found
label2 Eighteen ratty dollars  and a filthy diaper
label2 Good night, baby
label2 Did I ever telic you I was struck by lightning seven times
label2 Once, I was walking my dog down the road
label2 Iâ€™m blind in the one eye, can't hardly hear,  get twitches and shakes out of nowhere, always losing my line of thought
label2 God keeps reminding me Iâ€™m lucky to be alive
label2 Storm's coming
label2 May I help you, sir
label2 Up the stairs, first bedroom
label2 Wake up
label2 Let's get you dressed
label2 Now that's something
label2 Thank you
label2 You can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went
label2 You can swear and curse the Fates
label2 But when it comes to the end,  you have to let go
label2 Well, it sure is a beautiful service
label2 My baby
label2 Now, Iâ€™d never seen New York
label2 Excuse me, Iâ€™m a friend of Daisy's
label2 Right this way
label2 Daisy has company
label2 Daisy
label2 Daisy
label2 Yes
label2 Is somebody looking for me
label2 Benjamin
label2 What are you doing here
label2 Thought Iâ€™d come visit
label2 Spend some time with you, if I could
label2 You took me by surprise
label2 You can just throw them out
label2 No
label2 I couldn't take my eyes off of you
label2 I thought you were mesmerizing
label2 Thank you
label2 That's very kind of you to say
label2 A group of us are going to a party
label2 Would you want to come
label2 Someone told me about a restaurant  I thought you might enjoy
label2 I made a reservation, just in case
label2 Just, all the dancers go out after the show
label2 You're
label2 
label2 You're welcome to come with us
label2 Iâ€™ll get changed
label2 All right
label2 She choreographs for the Ballets Russes
label2 You were breathtaking
label2 Sweetie
label2 This is David
label2 He dances with the company
label2 Who
label2 I told you about him
label2 Oh, yeah
label2 How you doing
label2 Iâ€™ll go get you a drink
label2 Thanks
label2 So, you were a friend of her grandmother's
label2 Or something like that
label2 Something like that
label2 Come on
label2 Hey
label2 Now, I had no idea you were coming
label2 What did you expect
label2 What, you want me to drop everything
label2 Now, this is my life
label2 Babe
label2 Come on
label2 There's lots of musicians, interesting people
label2 You don't have to do that
label2 This is my fault
label2 I should've called
label2 I thought Iâ€™d come here  and sweep you off your feet or something
label2 Daisy
label2 Come on
label2 Let's go
label2 Seems nice
label2 Do you love him
label2 Iâ€™m happy for you
label2 Maybe Iâ€™ll see you at home
label2 Okay
label2 I enjoyed the show
label2 You couldn't have known
label2 I was 23. l. 
label2 I just didn't care
label2 What did you do next
label2 Some photographs, I think, in the front of my bag
label2 I was as good a dancer as I was ever gonna be
label2 
label2 I danced everywhere
label2 London, Vienna, Prague
label2 Iâ€™ve never seen these
label2 Mom
label2 Well, I was the only American  to be invited to dance with the Bolshoi, sugar
label2 It was glorious
label2 But Benjamin was never far from my thoughts
label2 "Good night, Daisy.
label2 He said that
label2 "Life wasn't all that complicated
label2 "If you want, you might say I was looking for something.
label2 Benjamin
label2 Mrs. La Tourneau just passed
label2 That'd be me
label2 Thank you
label2 Miss Daisy Fuller
label2 Just a minute
label2 Please have a seat
label2 Sure
label2 Whether it's by accident or by design, there's not a thing we can do about it
label2 A woman in Paris was on her way to go shopping
label2 When she had gotten her coat, the phone had rung
label2 So she had stopped to answer it and talked for a couple of minutes
label2 While the woman was on the phone,  Daisy was rehearsing for a performance at the Paris Opera House
label2 And while she was rehearsing, the woman, off the phone now,  had gone outside to get a taxi
label2 Now, a taxi driver had dropped off a fare earlier,  and had stopped to get a cup of coffee
label2 And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing
label2 The taxi had to stop for a man crossing the street,  who had left for work five minutes later than he normally did  because he forgot to set his alarm
label2 While that man, late for work, was crossing the street,  Daisy had finished rehearsing and was taking a shower
label2 And while Daisy was showering,  the taxi was waiting outside a boutique for the woman to pick up a package  which hadn't been wrapped yet,  because the girl who was supposed to wrap it  had broken up with her boyfriend the night before and forgot
label2 When the package was wrapped, the woman, who was back in the cab,  was blocked by a delivery truck
label2 The delivery truck pulled away, and the taxi was able to move  while Daisy, the last to be dressed,  waited for one of her friends who had broken a shoelace
label2 While the taxi was stopped, waiting for a traffic light,  Daisy and her friend came out the back of the theater
label2 And if only one thing had happened differently,  if that shoelace hadn't broken  or that delivery truck had moved moments earlier  or that package had been wrapped and ready  because the girl hadn't broken up with her boyfriend,  or that man had set his alarm and got up five minutes earlier  or that taxi driver hadn't stopped for a cup of coffee  or that woman had remembered her coat and got into an earlier cab,  Daisy and her friend would have crossed the street  and the taxi would have driven by
label2 But, life being what it is,  a series of intersecting lives and incidents  out of anyone's control,  that taxi did not go by,  and that driver was momentarily distracted
label2 And that taxi hit Daisy
label2 Daisy
label2 Help
label2 Daisy
label2 Who told you
label2 Your friend wired me
label2 Very kind of you to come all this way to see that I was all right
label2 My God
label2 Look at you
label2 You're perfect
label2 I wish you hadn't come here
label2 Her leg had been broken in five places
label2 And with therapy and time, she might walk again
label2 But she'd never dance
label2 Iâ€™m gonna take you home with me
label2 I want to look after you
label2 Then Iâ€™ll stay here in Paris
label2 Don't you understand
label2 I don't want your help
label2 I know Iâ€™m feeling sorry for myself, but I don't want to be with you
label2 You don't listen
label2 You might change your mind
label2 Just stay out of my life
label2 I was awfully cruel
label2 He didn't understand
label2 "I didn't leave right away
label2 "I stayed in Paris for a while to look out for her.
label2 I never knew that
label2 I taught myself to walk again
label2 I took the train to Lourdes
label2 Let's take a look
label2 That's normal
label2 Pulse rate is slowing
label2 Will you be all right
label2 Yeah
label2 All right, he says, "I went back home.
label2 And then there's a lot of pages torn out
label2 "I listened to the sound of the house.
label2 He
label2 
label2 
label2 He spilt something on it, so it's hard to read, Mom
label2 Something about sailing, does that make sense
label2 I learned to sail an old boat of my father's from the lake house
label2 Or maybe three
label2 Don't know why you bother, Sam, just gonna be there again tomorrow
label2 Mama
label2 And in the spring of 1 962,  she came back
label2 You want to know where Iâ€™ve been
label2 No
label2 Just disappearing like that
label2 It was something I needed to do for myself
label2 Yeah, well, I never took you to be the selfish type
label2 I sure hope Iâ€™m not wrong
label2 Iâ€™m usually not wrong about people
label2 Good night, baby
label2 You haven't said two words
label2 I don't want to ruin it
label2 Sleep with me
label2 Absolutely
label2 I asked her to come away with me
label2 I am so glad we didn't find one another when I was 26
label2 Why do you say that
label2 I was so young
label2 And you were so old
label2 It happened when it was supposed to happen
label2 I will enjoy each and every moment I have with you
label2 I bet I can stay out here longer than you
label2 Barely a line or a crease
label2 Every day I have more wrinkles
label2 Itâ€™s not fair
label2 I love your wrinkles
label2 What's it like growing younger
label2 I can't really say
label2 Iâ€™m always looking out my own eyes
label2 Will you still love me when I have acne
label2 When I wet the bed
label2 When Iâ€™m afraid of what's under the stairs
label2 What
label2 What are you thinking
label2 Some things last
label2 Good night, Daisy
label2 Good night, Benjamin
label2 Mom
label2 When did you meet Dad
label2 Some time after that
label2 Did you telic him about this Benjamin
label2 He knew enough, darling
label2 Queenie
label2 Hello
label2 Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin
label2 Oh, Benjamin
label2 Queenie died
label2 Iâ€™m so sorry
label2 Iâ€™m so sorry for your loss
label2 She was a great woman
label2 We buried her beside her beloved Mr. Weathers
label2 It is a wonderful old place, darling
label2 I think we are going to be so happy here
label2 Oh, what a long family history you have
label2 They come with the house
label2 Come on
label2 We bought ourselves a duplex
label2 I loved that house
label2 It smelled like firewood
label2 Don't
label2 
label2 Don't stop, darling
label2 "It was one of the happiest times of my life.
label2 We would have picnics in the living room
label2 We ate when we felt like it
label2 Stayed up all night when we wanted
label2 We vowed never to fall into routine,  to go to bed or wake up at the same time
label2 We lived on that mattress
label2 Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam, was a physical therapist
label2 We lived four blocks from a public pool
label2 So, even if nothing ever happened,  you'd still be right here where you are now
label2 They put too much chlorine in here
label2 I promise you Iâ€™ll never lose myself to selfpity again
label2 And I think right there and then  she realized none of us is perfect forever
label2 She found peace
label2 She opened a studio and taught young girls how to dance
label2 And tendu
label2 And spot, spot, spot
label2 Excellent
label2 Good night, Miss Daisy
label2 You certainly are beautiful to watch
label2 Dancing's all about the line
label2 Sooner or later, you lose that line, and you never get it back
label2 I figure, you were born in 1 91 8, 49 years ago
label2 Iâ€™m 43
label2 We are almost the same age
label2 We're meeting in the middle
label2 Wait
label2 I want to remember us just as we are now
label2 Iâ€™m pregnant
label2 You know, I swear the nurse slipped and said it was a boy
label2 But I think it's a girl
label2 I know you're afraid
label2 Iâ€™m not hiding it
label2 What's your worst fear
label2 Baby born like me
label2 Okay
label2 How can I be a father when Iâ€™m heading in the other direction
label2 Itâ€™s not fair to a child
label2 I don't want to be anybody's burden
label2 Sugar, we all end up in diapers
label2 I want this, and I want it with you
label2 I want you to have everything you want, all of it
label2 Iâ€™m just not sure how to reconcile this
label2 Would you telic a blind man he couldn't have children
label2 Youâ€™ll be a father for as long as you can
label2 I know the consequences
label2 Iâ€™ve accepted that
label2 Loving you is worth everything to me
label2 The oldest woman to ever swim the English Channel  arrived here today in Calais...  Keep it
label2 The 68yearold Elizabeth Abbott arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,  exhausted but happy
label2 Miss Abbott, how would you sum up, in words, this achievement
label2 I suppose..
label2 Anything's possible
label2 All right
label2 Yes
label2 Thank you
label2 Thank you very much
label2 Thank you
label2 Yeah
label2 You're very kind
label2 In the spring, on a day like any other...  Iâ€™ll be back in an hour
label2 Honey
label2 Go and call an ambulance
label2 The baby's coming
label2 The baby's coming
label2 271 4 Napoleon
label2 There you go
label2 Keep breathing
label2 Deep breaths
label2 There we go
label2 She's a perfectly healthy baby girl
label2 Honey
label2 She gave birth to a five pound, four ounce baby girl
label2 Did you count the toes
label2 She's perfect
label2 "And we named her for my mother, Caroline.
label2 This Benjamin was my father
label2 Excuse me
label2 Hey, I know it's hard
label2 You can't smoke in here
label2 Nobody can telic you exactly where it's gonna hit,  but we have to go with the guidance that we have,  incorporate that information and then pass it along to you
label2 "You grew as the doctor had promised, normal and healthy.
label2 You're gonna have to find a real father for her
label2 She's gonna need someone to grow old with
label2 Sheâ€™ll learn to accept whatever happens
label2 She loves you
label2 Honey, she needs a father, not a playmate
label2 Of course not
label2 Is my age beginning to bother you
label2 Of course not
label2 Is that what you're telling me
label2 You can't raise the both of us
label2 We had a party for you
label2 How are you
label2 Hey, man
label2 Before you turn around, theyâ€™ll be in high school, dating
label2 I sold the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain,  I sold Button's Buttons,  I sold my father's sailboat, put it all into a savings account
label2 And so that you and your mother might have a life,  I left, before you could ever remember me
label2 I don't want to read this now
label2 Can you just telic me where he went
label2 I don't really know
label2 Itâ€™s for me
label2 1 970
label2 I was two
label2 "I wish I could have kissed you good night.
label2 They're all for me
label2 "I wish I could have taken you to your first day of school.
label2 Six
label2 "I wish I could have been there to teach you to play piano.
label2 1 981 , 1 3
label2 "I wish I could have told you not to chase some boy
label2 "I wish I could have held you when you had a broken heart
label2 Nothing I ever did will replace that.
label2 I guess he went to India
label2 "For what it's worth, it's never too late,  "or, in my case, too early
label2 .
label2 ...or, in my case, too early,  to be whoever you want to be
label2 There's no time limit
label2 Start whenever you want
label2 You can change or stay the same

label2 He had been gone a long time
label2 Iâ€™ll see you next Thursday
label2 Good night, Miss Daisy
label2 Oh, good night, sweetheart
label2 Can I help you
label2 Are you here to pick somebody up
label2 Mom
label2 You ready yet
label2 Mom, what's wrong
label2 I was just hearing a very sad story about a mutual friend  who I hadn't seen for a very long time
label2 Caroline, this is Benjamin
label2 Hi
label2 Hi
label2 Hey
label2 Oh, Iâ€™m sorry, I thought you were done
label2 Benjamin Button, this is my husband, Robert
label2 How do you do
label2 A pleasure
label2 Well, it was very nice to meet you
label2 Weâ€™ll be in the car, darling
label2 All right
label2 Wow
label2 She's beautiful
label2 Like her mother
label2 Does she dance
label2 Not very well
label2 I guess that'd be from my side of things
label2 She's a dear, sweet girl
label2 She seems a little lost
label2 A lot of her reminds me of you
label2 My husband, he's a widower, or was
label2 
label2 Was a widower
label2 He's been a terrific father
label2 Good
label2 You are so much younger
label2 Only on the outside
label2 You were right
label2 I couldn't have been raising both of you
label2 Iâ€™m not that strong
label2 What are you gonna do
label2 Iâ€™m staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel on the Avenue
label2 I don't know what Iâ€™m gonna do
label2 But
label2 
label2 They're waiting
label2 That was him
label2 The hurricane has changed directions
label2 Itâ€™s going to make landfall sometime soon
label2 Am I supposed to do something
label2 Arrangements are being made  to move people, but it's up to you
label2 No
label2 No, we're
label2 
label2 Iâ€™ll let you know if anything changes
label2 "That night, while I was sitting and wondering why I came back at all,  "there was a knock at the door.
label2 Come in
label2 Are you all right
label2 Iâ€™m sorry, I don't know what Iâ€™m doing here
label2 I have never stopped loving you
label2 Oh, but, Benjamin, Iâ€™m an old woman now
label2 ...so few people even know  that you were ever in jail in the first place
label2 Iâ€™ll telic you, I am sick about it, too,  because, please, if they're not gonna give you an award  like "Man of the Year," at least what they could do  is stop having you listed as an exconvict  which I think is, again, so unfair
label2 Good night, Benjamin
label2 Good night, Daisy
label2 And as I knew I would, I watched her go
label2 That's the last thing he wrote
label2 Hello
label2 Yes, speaking
label2 Iâ€™m sorry, I don't understand
label2 Itâ€™s the corner house
label2 Iâ€™m Daisy Fuller
label2 Iâ€™m David Hernandez,  with the Orleans Parish Department of Child Welfare Services
label2 He was living in a condemned building
label2 The police found this with him
label2 This address
label2 Itâ€™s got your name in it a lot
label2 He doesn't seem to know who or where he is
label2 He's very confused
label2 I was telling Mr. Hernandez that Benjamin is one of us
label2 lf he needs a place to stay, it's all right, he can stay here
label2 You play beautifully
label2 He doesn't seem to like to be touched
label2 He goes in and out of states of recognition
label2 The doctors say, if they didn't know any better,  he has the beginnings of dementia
label2 Do you remember me
label2 Iâ€™m Daisy
label2 Iâ€™m Benjamin
label2 Itâ€™s nice to meet you, Benjamin
label2 I would love to hear you play
label2 Do I know you
label2 I want some breakfast
label2 No, I didn't
label2 You just finished eating
label2 Don't think I don't know what you're doing
label2 He doesn't believe he just had his breakfast
label2 Now, why don't we see  if we can't find something else for you to do
label2 Well, like what, sugar
label2 Itâ€™s like there's this whole life I had,  and I can't remember what it was
label2 Itâ€™s okay
label2 Itâ€™s okay to forget things
label2 There he is, he's up there on the roof
label2 It wasn't easy
label2 Benjamin
label2 I can see everything
label2 I can see the big river
label2 That's right,  you can see everything, sweetheart
label2 I can see the graveyard where Mama's buried,  and all those other people
label2 What if I could fly
label2 I knew a man who could fly
label2 You come down and Iâ€™ll telic you all about him
label2 Somebody go up there
label2 Nearly the same age I was when I had met him
label2 "This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo  "at 5:00 in the afternoon  "when he had got his beautiful hind legs.
label2 The days passed
label2 And I watched as he forgot how to walk  and how to talk
label2 Iâ€™m Daisy
label2 Can you say "Daisy"
label2 In 2002, they put up a new clock in that train station
label2 And in the spring of 2003,  he looked at me  and I knew that he knew who I was
label2 I wish Iâ€™d known him
label2 Now you do
label2 Mom, I think I should go see what's going on
label2 Good night, Benjamin

label2 So do you
label2 To think I was worried
label2 Worried about me

label2 I went, not once, but twice through the spanking machine
label2 I can only imagine
label2 How are you
label2 Connie asked me the same thing today
label2 Really
label2 I've always liked your brother
label2 Anyway..
label2 I..
label2 I just thought  this might be difficult for you...  Just another birthday
label2 That's right
label2 He was 48, wasn't he
label2 I hadn't really thought about it until now
label2 I honestly don't know
label2 Please send Dr. Mel and Rachel my best
label2 She has a little brother on the way
label2 Official nuclear family
label2 You must be very pleased
label2 We are
label2 We are very pleased
label2 I guess I should let you go
label2 Take care of yourself
label2 You too, Nicholas
label2 I mean that
label2 I really do
label2 Uhhuh
label2 Be well
label2 A proposal to encourage small businesses to provide their employees  with health insurance is now being debated by Washington legislators
label2 However, Democratic lawmakers are voicing serious concerns  about the bill, claiming that it would undermine local efforts..
label2 I just wanna make sure that we understand each other
label2 Once you get it down on paper then you can count on my full support
label2 We understand that
label2 Thank you
label2 We'll talk soon
label2 I do feel that it reflects negatively on me
label2 I received this... Just a moment
label2 I'm sorry you feel that way
label2 I understand
label2 We hope we haven't caused you any inconvenience
label2 Thank you for choosing CRS
label2 Mr. Feingold, could you assist this gentleman
label2 Oh, yeah
label2 Sure
label2 My brother sent me this card...  Oh, here we go
label2 Yeah
label2 ... as a gift
label2 All right, excellent
label2 Well, let's get started
label2 Yeah, I'm sorry about the... You know, all this hullabaloo here
label2 We're, uh... Well, we're still moving
label2 You mind holding that

label2 Thank you
label2 Are you hungry
label2 No, thank you
label2 Next to Chinatown
label2 A gift from Conrad Van Orton
label2 Interesting
label2 Well, your brother was a client with our London branch
label2 We do a sort of informal scoring,  and his numbers are outstanding
label2 Really
label2 Hmm
label2 No, thank you
label2 Okay, fine
label2 Now, you need to fill out these forms
label2 There's an application  and then a couple of psychtests there
label2 Oh, uh, for the financial questionnaire,  don't answer anything you don't feel like
label2 "I sometimes hurt small animals, true or false"
label2 "I feel guilty when I masturbate. 
label2 Well, I don't write the questions
label2 I just review the answers
label2 Well, to give us an overall sense of your capability...  No, what is this for
label2 What are you selling
label2 Oh
label2 It's a game
label2 A game
label2 Specifically tailored for each participant
label2 Think of it as a great vacation
label2 What... What kind of vacation
label2 It's different every time
label2 Humor me with specifics
label2 And what if nothing is lacking
label2 May I make two suggestions
label2 Second, you don't have to decide today
label2 Take the silly test, fill out the stupid forms
label2 One day, your game begins
label2 You either love it or hate it
label2 Decide then
label2 You know we... We are like  an experiential bookofthemonth club
label2 That was my sales pitch
label2 How long will this take
label2 About an hour for those, another hour for the physical
label2 Physical
label2 You'll be out of here in no time
label2 Confused
label2 Risky
label2 Bloody
label2 Whoops
label2 Cancel it
label2 Push it back till Wednesday
label2 And Anson Baer called about tomorrow
label2 Tomorrow
label2 Yes, that's correct
label2 Shouldn't be long
label2 You said that two hours ago
label2 All right
label2 Put it back until tomorrow
label2 Selection before the following emotional responses
label2 You have 0.9 seconds to enter your emotional response
label2 Reaction time is a factor
label2 You have 0.9 seconds to enter your emotional response
label2 I'm sorry to keep you waiting
label2 Oh, don't worry
label2 It's been just terrific spending my entire day  with your crack team
label2 Well, it's all down to this
label2 This is an insurance company requirement
label2 Our guarantee, payment's entirely  at your brother's discretion as a gift
label2 It's dependent on your satisfaction
label2 Does that mean that if I'm not happy he doesn't have to pay
label2 That's never happened
label2 I think you mean, dissatisfied
label2 That's right
label2 You're a leftbrained word fetishist
label2 Initials, initials, and sign there  in blood
label2 Just kidding
label2 All right
label2 Now, your copy will be at the front desk in this folder
label2 What about Monday or Tuesday
label2 No, that's bad for me
label2 Well, how about tonight
label2 Well, I'm working all this evening
label2 Wednesday is the only possibility right now
label2 Do you wanna do dinner
label2 Okay
label2 Really
label2 What did you think
label2 Well they seemed just a little bit disorganized
label2 Well, when I did it in London they'd been around a while
label2 No, I haven't decided yet
label2 Telling you, it's like getting in on the ground floor of the next Disneyland
label2 CRS won't go public
label2 They're familyowned
label2 Stranger things have happened
label2 They opened here
label2 The game in San Francisco
label2 They're doing fine without any of us
label2 Nicholas
label2 How are you
label2 James, good evening
label2 Good evening, sir
label2 We have new members here
label2 Put their next round on me
label2 Got you, sir
label2 No, no, no, no
label2 Last time I played Pebble I swore I'd never pick up another club again
label2 Well, the reason I mention it is I took the test today at the Montgomery Street office
label2 You did
label2 Kudos
label2 So, yours hasn't started yet
label2 That was one of the questions I had for you
label2 What is it
label2 Oh, what is it
label2 You know, I envy you
label2 I wish I could go back and do it for the first time all over again
label2 Here's to new experiences
label2 Good night, Ted
label2 Nicholas
label2 Nice to meet you
label2 So, you played recently
label2 I was working in Los Angeles
label2 Oh, I hear the London office is very good, too..
label2 It sounds like a lot of fantasy, roleplaying nonsense, though
label2 You wanna know what it is
label2 John chapter 0 verse 25
label2 I, um,  haven't been to Sunday school in a long time
label2 "Whereas once I was blind,  "now I can see. 
label2 Good night, Nicholas
label2 Best of luck
label2 If the BaerGrant meeting  is not held tomorrow  may as well not be held at all
label2 So you will miss another opera you would have slept during anyway
label2 We now have an opportunity to show our clients  how well we will rise to his exhilarating challenge
label2 Yes
label2 Nicholas Van Orton
label2 Who is this
label2 This is Cynthia from CRS
label2 We've finished processing your application
label2 Look, I'm in a meeting right now
label2 I'm afraid it was rejected
label2 I beg your pardon
label2 You shouldn't feel this reflects negatively on you
label2 We hope we haven't caused you any inconvenience
label2 Anything wrong
label2 Uh, no
label2 No, nothing's...  You may hang up or press pound for more options
label2 Oh, this is Conrad
label2 Yes, Connie, it's Nicholas
label2 Give me a ring when you get in
label2 Oh, uh, regarding your birthday present,  um, things are a little crazy right now
label2 I don't really know if I can fit it in my schedule
label2 But we'll talk about it at dinner tomorrow
label2 Thanks, bye
label2 Hello
label2 ...the resulting rise of unemployment and decline  into buyable small businesses
label2 No one has expressed an opinion as to how it will impact  the pampered existence of Nicholas Van Orton
label2 The one thing on which both Democrats and Republicans seem to agree  is that most Americans harbor serious doubts about the economic future
label2 A recent poll suggests a staggering 57% of American workers believe  there is a very real chance they will be unemployed within the next 5 to 7 years
label2 But what does that matter to a bloated millionaire fat cat like you
label2 I..
label2 I don't..
label2 It's frustrating for me if you don't pay attention
label2 What is this
label2 This is your game, Nicholas, and welcome to it
label2 I'm here to let you in on a few ground rules
label2 You received the very first key, and others will follow
label2 So keep your eyes open
label2 How do you... You can see me
label2 How does this work
label2 There's a tiny camera looking at you right now
label2 It's impossible
label2 You're right, impossible
label2 You're having a conversation with your television
label2 It's miniaturized
label2 Mr. Van Orton
label2 And in domestic news,  in Southern California..
label2 Yes, Ilsa
label2 What is it
label2 It's fine
label2 It's...  ...in the petroleum processing plant yesterday
label2 Will you be needing anything else
label2 No, I won't, Ilsa
label2 Thank you
label2 Good night, then
label2 ...in a petroleum processing plant yesterday
label2 Several workers were injured in the... Who was that
label2 Never mind who that is
label2 You wanna know how a camera got into your home, don't you
label2 Yes, I would
label2 Colder
label2 Warm
label2 Warmer
label2 It's a 24hour Consumer Recreation Services hotline
label2 For emergencies only
label2 But don't call asking what the object of the game is
label2 Figuring that out is the object of the game
label2 ...regret to have the American ambassador expelled after the incident
label2 US State Department responded quickly with a formal apology
label2 An announcement of the ambassador's immediate voluntary removal...  Hey, buddy, spare any change
label2 Huh
label2 If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
label2 May I help you
label2 What is it
label2 What
label2 Thank you
label2 Buddy
label2 Can you help me out
label2 I ran out
label2 Just... Just go into the next stall
label2 Hello
label2 Hello
label2 Didn't expect to see you here
label2 Been up all night
label2 I checked it
label2 Personally
label2 I appreciate that, Sam
label2 Why don't you go home and get some sleep
label2 You're sure you don't want me along
label2 Hmm, nice shirt
label2 Don't ask
label2 Ciao
label2 You promised to meet the projections, Anson
label2 $1.60 a share is what you said
label2 I don't think this visit comes as a surprise
label2 Projections were far too optimistic
label2 Our EPS was 150 last quarter
label2 We're up 6 cents..
label2 The expectations were 10, and in this case the expectations meant everything
label2 My stock is falling
label2 I don't know about yours
label2 Those pennies are costing millions
label2 If you still feel this way, vote your shares...  Today is what counts, Anson
label2 You...  You intractable son of a bitch
label2 If your father could see you now
label2 What
label2 Your father was a friend
label2 A friend
label2 God damn it
label2 I've watched you grow up
label2 I will tell you..
label2 I'm not finished
label2 Now, you misspoke before when you said you're stepping down
label2 I am firing you
label2 Confidence is restored
label2 The stock goes up
label2 No
label2 Where's Stewart Grant
label2 He's probably out there sailing  enjoying his golden years wondering where the hell you are, Anson
label2 I'm sorry
label2 You failed
label2 I have prepared a severance package that is more than  equitable
label2 If I leave without your signature,  this agreement begins to disintegrate
label2 Benefits shrink, options narrow  and your compensation will be shriveled
label2 I think it's in your  best interest, Anson, to...  Well, I guess this is your  lucky day
label2 My lawyers will be in touch with you
label2 Has Conrad Van Orton left a message
label2 I'll check on it right away, Mr. Van Orton
label2 Thank you
label2 Oh, I'm so sorry
label2 Here
label2 Please, don't do that
label2 I'm so sorry
label2 I'm really having a bad day
label2 How about a bad month
label2 You did almost exactly the same thing to me when I was here last week
label2 Here
label2 Don't do that
label2 I don't think so
label2 It was an accident, sir
label2 Terrific
label2 I said I was sorry
label2 Christine
label2 Mr. Van Orton is a valued customer
label2 Fine
label2 Then you kiss his ass
label2 Don't you talk to me like that
label2 I apologized,  I offered to help
label2 Clean out your locker
label2 What
label2 I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Van Orton
label2 If you're not too uncomfortable,  will this table suit you for a complimentary meal
label2 It'll be fine
label2 I'll fetch your waiter
label2 Thank you
label2 Check, sir
label2 Pardon me, miss
label2 Oh, great
label2 It's you
label2 I don't know how this works, but do you have something for me
label2 I received this note...  What're you babbling about, psycho
label2 I need to know what is going on
label2 You wanna know what's going on
label2 I'm going on my second job this month
label2 Maybe I should try to explain...  Don't explain, just fuck off
label2 Son of a bitch
label2 I am..
label2 I'm trying to..
label2 I...  Jesus, what is this
label2 What's with him
label2 He fell down
label2 Can you hear me
label2 Do you know what to do
label2 I don't even know if he's breathing
label2 Here you are
label2 Move your head
label2 Don't stand there
label2 Hey, hey
label2 It's okay
label2 We're gonna get help
label2 How do we know he's real
label2 He's pissed his pants, mister
label2 He's turning blue
label2 Police
label2 Police
label2 You will have to fill these forms out
label2 I don't know this man
label2 Here, what do you need
label2 Can't get involved in this shit
label2 Hey, I might have to detain you
label2 The report's gotta be filled out
label2 She can do the reports
label2 Ride with your wife
label2 We'll meet at the hospital
label2 Two blocks away
label2 She's not my wife
label2 Let's go
label2 10 minutes ago, I'm about to enjoy a quiet little dinner
label2 I received this note..
label2 He's breathing, isn't he
label2 Is the siren entirely necessary
label2 Let's just talk to someone who can get this over with, shall we
label2 They need your driver's license number
label2 Oh, no
label2 You've got to be kidding
label2 What is happening
label2 This was what I was trying to explain to you
label2 This is a...  A game
label2 A what
label2 They plan elaborate pranks
label2 Things like this
label2 I don't really understand it myself
label2 What are you talking about
label2 The lights, they went out
label2 A hundred people ran away
label2 What, so you mean the guy who just pissed himself and turned blue was..
label2 Sorry about that
label2 You should be
label2 There's gotta be a...  A flashlight
label2 Oh, great
label2 I thought that guy was going to die
label2 I'll see you around
label2 How do you know that's the way
label2 I don't
label2 Where did you all go, you motherfucking frat boys
label2 Lobby
label2 My brother got me this gift certificate to this company...  Why, I got the key out of this...  Out of the mouth of this  wooden clown
label2 I can't take this
label2 There's no signal
label2 What is the going rate for a trappedinelevator adventure
label2 Well, don't even think about it
label2 Read what the sign says
label2 "Warning, do not attempt to open if the elevator stops
label2 "Use emergency... "  Phone
label2 "... phone. 
label2 If there was one
label2 Okay, I'll give you a boost
label2 You get up, you go first
label2 This is not an attempt to be gallant
label2 If I don't lift you how are you going to get up there
label2 I don't know, you'll pull me up
label2 It's easier my way
label2 No
label2 Oh, please
label2 Okay
label2 There I said it
label2 Okay
label2 We can use this like a ladder
label2 My hero, let's go
label2 I don't think so
label2 Damn it
label2 My briefcase
label2 Not as if anybody could open it
label2 Wait a minute
label2 This is CRS
label2 What's CRS
label2 The one that gave me the gift certificate
label2 This is their building
label2 We'll wait
label2 We'll wait for security to come  and we'll just explain
label2 Explain for both of us
label2 Wait
label2 We don't wanna draw any attention...  Just out for a stroll
label2 Run
label2 We can't fit down there
label2 Hey
label2 You're a grown man
label2 I'm not responsible for..
label2 I'm not the one who started running
label2 Well I'm not the one that started this...  Get up there
label2 Climb
label2 So, where's your modesty around attack dogs
label2 Hey
label2 Shut up
label2 Let me guess
label2 I go first
label2 There goes a thousand dollars
label2 Your shoes cost a thousand dollars
label2 That one did
label2 Here
label2 Come on
label2 Okay
label2 What
label2 There should be a fire escape
label2 Yeah, it's classic
label2 Why me
label2 Who are you
label2 Nicholas Van Orton
label2 What are you, a czar or something
label2 All right
label2 I think not
label2 Be careful

label2 That tall bright building
label2 It's right near there
label2 Everything okay, miss
label2 San Francisco's finest
label2 Is there some place I could throw this
label2 There's a wastebasket beside the desk
label2 Oh
label2 Think I have a fresh sweatshirt for you somewhere
label2 You know, you've never even asked me my name
label2 The maitre d' said your name was Christine
label2 Oh, right
label2 I guess I'll call you a cab
label2 You got a shower in your office
label2 Yeah
label2 You an athlete or something
label2 I move money from one place to another
label2 Actually, would you mind if I just quickly rinsed off
label2 No
label2 Yeah, it's behind the door
label2 Oh, I'll just be a second
label2 No problem
label2 Listen, I know the owner of the City Club and I'd be happy  to give him a call if you'd like
label2 Don't, it was a shitty job anyway
label2 I, uh..
label2 I have a confession to make
label2 Someone gave me 400 bucks to spill drinks on you as a practical joke
label2 And what did they say
label2 Well they said 300
label2 I said 4
label2 They said, "The guy in the gray flannel suit. 
label2 Mr. Van Orton
label2 Thank you
label2 Hello
label2 Mr. Van Orton, it's Maria

label2 I'll be in there in an hour
label2 Can you..
label2 Could you check with Lost and Found, please

label2 I'm sure I don't know
label2 Of course you don't
label2 Thank you
label2 Sorry, my fault
label2 Welcome back
label2 Have we met
label2 I believe so
label2 If you'll just sign here on the signature card

label2 I'm not following you
label2 I'm just driving it
label2 Hey,  whatever I'm doing is none of your business
label2 Is that what this is all about
label2 Look buddy, back off
label2 Just back off, huh
label2 What
label2 Oh, that's cute
label2 I suppose the game uses real bullets, huh
label2 All right
label2 I'm a private investigator
label2 Somebody hired me to keep tabs on you
label2 Who
label2 Who hired you
label2 Have him meet me at the Ritz Carlton
label2 I'm on my way
label2 What's happening
label2 Follow me, Sam
label2 Ah, Nicholas
label2 It's unexpected
label2 Now, do you really believe  that just because you publish children's books  people are gonna care about my reputation
label2 You can have pictures of me  wearing nipple rings, buttfucking Captain Kangaroo
label2 And whether that stock is up or down
label2 Daddy
label2 It's all right
label2 And the fact that you bring Conrad into this juvenile game  is unconscionable
label2 Are you finished
label2 No
label2 I'd like you to meet my attorney, Samuel Sutherland
label2 I think the two of you have got something to talk about
label2 Oh, we met this morning
label2 I signed the termination contract for BaerGrant
label2 I accepted your settlement, Nicholas
label2 I'm going sailing
label2 You're welcome to join our lunch
label2 Maybe we can straighten this out
label2 You remember my wife, Mary Carol, and my daughterinlaw, Kaleigh
label2 Please  accept my  misguided, uh...  How concerned should I be
label2 It looks a lot like you
label2 Well, you should see what they do with the nightly news
label2 What
label2 Can I ask you to do me a favor
label2 You know you can
label2 Find out about a company called Consumer Recreation Services
label2 Sounds like they make tennis rackets
label2 Wait a minute
label2 They gave me a waiver
label2 What is this
label2 It's a...  What's..
label2 It's invisible ink
label2 You're joking
label2 I'm being toyed with  by a bunch of depraved children
label2 This...  Are you okay
label2 Tell me not to worry
label2 You don't have to worry
label2 I promise
label2 I'll call you later
label2 Right
label2 Okay, bye
label2 What's the company that we use
label2 United
label2 What
label2 United Taxi Company
label2 United Taxi Company
label2 Call United, find out who the driver was  and where they took her
label2 Ilsa
label2 You fuckers
label2 Ilsa
label2 Ilsa
label2 Ilsa
label2 Mr. Van Orton
label2 What do you mean
label2 What's happened
label2 The house, you haven't seen the house
label2 What's wrong
label2 Now, lock your door
label2 Stay inside, just lock your door
label2 Oh, be careful
label2 Yes, I need the police
label2 There's been a break in to my house
label2 Just stay on the line and give me your address
label2 My address is 2210 Broadway
label2 It's the biggest house on the street
label2 Yes
label2 Yes, there's been a break in
label2 Are you sure they're gone
label2 What
label2 Nickie
label2 Hello, sir
label2 Are you still there
label2 Hello
label2 Sir
label2 All right
label2 What happened
label2 Shh
label2 Conrad, where're we going
label2 What are you doing
label2 They're methodical
label2 If I can't trust the room service in the hotel,  I sure as hell can't trust a fucking car
label2 Who
label2 Who do you think
label2 Jesus
label2 When I think what I almost got you into...  What are you saying
label2 Oh, I'm so fucked
label2 They just fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you
label2 All right, calm down
label2 Just take a breath
label2 They won't stop, Nick
label2 I paid the bill
label2 I gave them their fucking money
label2 Everything
label2 I'm a goddamned human piñata
label2 Calm down
label2 And why do they keep playing if you've already paid
label2 I don't know
label2 I don't know
label2 They did this
label2 It's a flat tire
label2 How do you know
label2 Get a grip on yourself, will you
label2 Okay, okay
label2 The phone doesn't work
label2 Really
label2 You know how to change a tire
label2 No, don't you
label2 It can't be that hard
label2 I don't think we should be out in the open like this
label2 It's in the glove compartment
label2 You're with them
label2 What
label2 You're doing this
label2 You're part of it
label2 I don't know about those
label2 Somebody put them in the car
label2 What are you talking about
label2 You brought them to me
label2 These were in your car
label2 They're right there in your fucking car
label2 Conrad
label2 Listen to what you're saying
label2 No
label2 You're not gonna control this conversation
label2 Because you resent me
label2 Stop being emotional
label2 Lower your voice, Conrad
label2 What
label2 You're afraid somebody's gonna witness the scene
label2 Get back in your... Get back in your fucking house
label2 Will you stop it
label2 You're just so afraid that somebody's gonna see  what a manipulative fucking control freak you are
label2 What is wrong with you
label2 What are you on
label2 Oh, I'm sorry, Nick
label2 Ah, bullshit
label2 I'm not you
label2 I'll never be you
label2 There you go again
label2 I'm your brother
label2 For Christ's sakes, I'm your brother
label2 All I ever tried to do was help you
label2 I don't want your help
label2 Nobody asked you to play dad
label2 You don't say that
label2 Did I have a choice
label2 Jackass
label2 Conrad
label2 What
label2 I don't want your help
label2 Did I have a choice
label2 Did I have a choice
label2 2210 Broadway
label2 Hey buddy, you missed the turn
label2 Hey
label2 Did you hear me
label2 You missed the turn back...  No, no, no
label2 Stop the car
label2 Stop the car
label2 Thank you
label2 Open, the goddamn door
label2 Listen
label2 I am a very wealthy man
label2 And whatever they're paying you  I'll double it
label2 Oh, Jesus Christ
label2 No
label2 What, are you out of your fucking mind
label2 It's a game
label2 Here they are
label2 Detective, I'm Sam Sutherland
label2 Tim Foley
label2 You know where we're going
label2 14th floor
label2 Okay
label2 The county recorder has no listing for a Consumer  Recreation Service or any derivation thereof
label2 The divers, they're still looking for the cab
label2 As soon as they find it they'll pull the plates and the VIN
label2 Have you spoken to your brother
label2 He hasn't called me back yet
label2 What about the house
label2 The graffiti was an oilbased marine marking solution,  illegal in the States
label2 It's not impossible to trace but it'll take time
label2 The photo, the gun,  the clown, the ambulance
label2 Breaking and entering we've got solid
label2 Malicious mischief, vandalism, harassment
label2 But that's all
label2 Reckless endangerment
label2 Attempted murder
label2 Except you said you hired these guys
label2 That's irrelevant
label2 It's our job to tell you what we've got
label2 So far, we don't have motive
label2 Why do you ask
label2 I don't know
label2 All the time I've known you you've never once asked about him
label2 I guess he was just on my mind
label2 Your mother loved your father very much
label2 I think he just worked too hard
label2 Was he, uh,  morose
label2 I mean...  What I remember most  was that his manner was so  slight
label2 No, what I mean is,  before he...  What happened
label2 No
label2 Nobody expected it
label2 I wonder how much of him there is in me
label2 Was Mother worried about him
label2 Nobody ever worried about your father
label2 It's Maria
label2 I found the address you wanted from United Taxi
label2 Yeah, give it to me
label2 It's on Potrero Hill...  Who are you
label2 Christine, is she here
label2 She's sleeping
label2 Hey
label2 What're you doing here
label2 Sure
label2 Hi
label2 Didn't think I'd ever see you again
label2 What can you tell me about these
label2 Is this you
label2 Where did you get them
label2 My hotel room
label2 Are you telling me that this is not you
label2 What makes you, um..
label2 Think this is me
label2 The bra
label2 The red bra
label2 Okay
label2 Well, I thought that...  Can I sit down for a minute
label2 Sure
label2 Are you all right
label2 You're not all right, are you
label2 I'm sorry, I am being a nuisance
label2 I should go
label2 No, it's okay
label2 I'll put some clothes on
label2 I'll be right back
label2 Do you have an aspirin
label2 Can I get you something to drink with this
label2 Is this you
label2 Oh, yeah
label2 Show it to me
label2 Take the picture out of the frame  and show it to me
label2 All right
label2 They're watching
label2 Not here
label2 They can see here
label2 Smoke detector
label2 What do you say, uh...  Let's go for a drive or something
label2 We could...  No, no, no
label2 I am tired of this
label2 I am goddamn tired of this
label2 There's a...  Who do you people think you are
label2 Who do you think you are
label2 Nicholas, please
label2 Let's go, right now
label2 Come on
label2 Just, come on out of there right now
label2 Now you've done it
label2 Get away from the window
label2 What the...  What is this
label2 Wake up, it's a fucking con
label2 Get in, get in
label2 You all right
label2 Hold on
label2 I could've handed you to them
label2 You don't have a choice
label2 No one else's gonna tell you what's going on
label2 You wanna know
label2 'Cause if I'm gone you never will
label2 I can't believe they didn't even take the time to get the fucking house right
label2 Who are they
label2 Nobody does
label2 Then what good are you
label2 I know things like who you can trust  and that your brother was in it from beginning... That's a lie
label2 Yeah
label2 I was your waitress on your birthday
label2 Connie told you about CRS that day
label2 Ever seen me in there before
label2 I mean, it wasn't his fault
label2 I guess he thought it was his only way out
label2 They fleeced him real good
label2 How did they get to him
label2 What are you talking about
label2 Have you checked your accounts
label2 That night in your office I got the number to your private line and modem  that gave CRS remote access to your computer
label2 What
label2 You took their tests, handwriting, voice samples, psych info
label2 They used it all to figure out your passwords
label2 And Feingold, the guy who signed you up,  he did 5 years for hacking Citibank
label2 They only had to keep you distracted  while they broke into your financial network,  transferred your holdings into dummy accounts...  Overseas operator, please
label2 Why else were they willing to shoot at us
label2 Because they're finished with you
label2 Live or dead's the same
label2 Long as you disappear
label2 Yeah
label2 Yes
label2 Bluetwobackslash0600
label2 "D" as in David
label2 That's right
label2 The balance
label2 They already got it, Nicholas
label2 You've reached the Sutherlands
label2 Please leave a message
label2 As you get this message, Sam, I have checked them all
label2 I don't know how,  but they have drained my accounts
label2 Now you call the cops
label2 I got one of them right here
label2 We'll make her testify
label2 I know how this sounds,  but you call me  on my cellular
label2 And you be careful
label2 They cut your card in half so...  My treat
label2 You take two sugars, right
label2 My name's not Christine
label2 It's..
label2 I mean, it's not my real name
label2 Who fucking cares
label2 It is just money
label2 I'd rather not talk about it right now
label2 All I mean is someone like you...  How many times have you done this
label2 I'm curious
label2 What
label2 These scams
label2 Lots
label2 But, whatever nickeldime bullshit you pulled in the past,  this is more than just me
label2 This is pension plans,  payrolls
label2 This is $600 million
label2 Nick, it's Sam
label2 I got your message
label2 So, what are we gonna do
label2 I've been on the phone for an hour already
label2 Nicholas, your funds are intact
label2 Nothing's been touched
label2 What are you talking about
label2 I checked on them myself
label2 I made the calls
label2 Nothing's changed
label2 I'm telling you
label2 Not one cent is unaccounted for
label2 Who is it
label2 He's in on it
label2 I don't know what the hell is happening, but stay where you are  until I get there
label2 Nicholas, I have another call
label2 Give me your precise location
label2 Nicholas
label2 We've got to get out of here
label2 How did they get to him
label2 Why did..
label2 I wouldn't worry about it
label2 It's out of your hands
label2 Cellular calls can be intercepted
label2 Those calls you made to B of A, France
label2 You were talking to us
label2 Access codes,  passwords, access codes, passwords...  Stuff even your lawyer didn't have
label2 Stuff even your lawyer didn't have
label2 We have it now so we're done
label2 Bye, Nicholas
label2 Things have happened  and it's important that... Shh, shh, shh
label2 No money, no identification, no passport
label2 What happened to you
label2 Where to begin..
label2 It always is
label2 I was on holiday alone  and I was robbed by two men
label2 Robbed
label2 And what hotel were you staying at
label2 I don't remember
label2 I...  Have you gone to the police
label2 And I just need enough to get out of here
label2 Oh, we'll help with the local law enforcement if you wanted to bother
label2 You say you were mugged
label2 And they didn't take that watch
label2 How much is a watch like that worth
label2 A couple of hundred at least
label2 Man with a watch like that doesn't necessarily have a passport problem
label2 Can I have your attention, please
label2 Thank you
label2 Anybody here going to San Francisco
label2 I've got $18 and 70...  78 cents  for a ride to San Francisco
label2 Anybody
label2 Keep the change
label2 Thanks, pal
label2 Conrad Van Orton
label2 One moment, please
label2 Is there a problem
label2 You're here for Conrad Van Orton
label2 Yes
label2 I'm the hotel manager
label2 Pleasure to meet you
label2 Where's my brother
label2 Wait a minute, is there trouble
label2 Sir, this is a private matter for you
label2 There was some complaints by other guests, damage to his room
label2 His behavior
label2 Yes, sir
label2 There was an incident a few days ago
label2 The police took him
label2 They left this address in case anyone came
label2 It's a hospital in Napa, sir
label2 I'm terribly sorry
label2 Elizabeth, I need to borrow your car
label2 Nickie,  what happened to you
label2 Look at me
label2 I don't know
label2 I..
label2 There're just some things I have to do, all right
label2 Of course, you can have it if you need it
label2 Can't I get you something to eat
label2 You know that you're the only person  that I can trust
label2 Everyone else is..
label2 If Sam Sutherland calls you,  you don't tell him you talked to me
label2 You lie to him
label2 Okay, coffee,  English muffin,  and your water
label2 This bottle  is open
label2 Who opened this bottle
label2 I don't want an opened bottle
label2 I want an unopened bottle
label2 I don't want ice in the glass
label2 I want just a glass,  please
label2 Nickie, talk to me
label2 You're scaring me
label2 I don't even know what you're saying
label2 I don't mean it
label2 You know, I've been thinking the last couple of days
label2 I've had some spare time
label2 And I wanted to tell you that  I understand why you left me
label2 And I know that I resented it
label2 I want to apologize to you  for shutting you out  and not being there
label2 And I hope that you can forgive me
label2 You're tired
label2 Then,  pain sets in
label2 The onset of a migraine headache
label2 If this sounds all too familiar, relief is here at last
label2 Oh no, you bastards
label2 For nearly a decade, doctors have been prescribing...  How did you find me here
label2 Taggarene is strong medicine for headaches, toothaches, muscle fatigue, joint pains..
label2 He's an actor
label2 So if you trust your doctor, trust Taggarene
label2 He's an actor on television
label2 Can't explain now
label2 Can I borrow your Yellow Pages
label2 Get out of the car, fucker
label2 You're making a mistake here
label2 Get the fuck out of the car
label2 I am extremely fragile  right now
label2 New Moon Cafe
label2 He does commercials
label2 Do you know how many customers we have
label2 Hundreds, thousands
label2 I know he ordered from you
label2 He's an actor
label2 He's like one of these people you have here up on your...  Hey
label2 Why are you taking my picture
label2 We were hoping he could audition today
label2 Oh, this will break his heart
label2 Well is there any place we can contact him
label2 Well, his beeper's here on the table
label2 He took the kids to the zoo
label2 The zoo
label2 That's very, very sweet
label2 Which zoo
label2 Oh, it's the one with the white tiger
label2 Okay, please
label2 I got my kids
label2 Get rid of them
label2 All right, guys, uh, guys
label2 More snacks
label2 Here, go, go, go
label2 That's all
label2 Uh..
label2 It was just a job
label2 Nothing personal
label2 You know
label2 I mean, I play my part,  improvise a little
label2 I need to talk to who's in charge
label2 Nobody knows
label2 I mean nobody gets a big picture...  Hey, Tammy, Alex cut it out
label2 Your offices are empty
label2 I need to find out where they are
label2 Look,  they own the whole building
label2 They just move from floor to floor
label2 You can get me in
label2 No, I can't
label2 Oh, yes, you can
label2 You can tell them the police called
label2 You tell them I'm gonna blow the whistle on them
label2 What whistle
label2 There's no fucking whistle
label2 This is very dangerous
label2 I don't think that you understand
label2 Michael, guys
label2 Well we're here
label2 Drive in
label2 What're you gonna do, anyway
label2 You won't get your money back
label2 I don't care about money
label2 I'm pulling back the curtain
label2 I wanna meet the wizard
label2 Pull in somewhere where they won't see you
label2 Shit
label2 Stay down
label2 You're not allowed to be here
label2 They called me back
label2 I got a fitting
label2 He's with me
label2 You don't need me
label2 Get in
label2 Oh, my God
label2 What floor
label2 You're fucked, you both
label2 They're gonna miss me
label2 Where
label2 It was a different floor then
label2 Then guess
label2 I..
label2 It went on this way, sort of..
label2 All right, take it easy
label2 It's gonna be a surprise
label2 Oh, fuck
label2 Back from the dead
label2 Nicholas, you're not about to shoot anyone
label2 Turn around
label2 You're gonna come with me
label2 Everybody down
label2 Stop
label2 You tell me
label2 Who's behind this
label2 Who did this to me
label2 What do you mean, "Why?
label2 How deluded can you be
label2 Who is responsible for this
label2 It wasn't you
label2 It wasn't personal
label2 It could've been any asshole with a couple of hundred million in the bank
label2 You get your boss up here
label2 You tell them I'm gonna shoot somebody
label2 They won't do it
label2 Oh, yes, they will
label2 You get somebody up here  because I'm gonna kill you
label2 They don't care about me, Nicholas
label2 You're not in a position to threaten anyone
label2 Wait a minute
label2 Where'd you get that
label2 That gun
label2 That's not an automatic
label2 What the fuck are you talking about
label2 Where did you get the gun
label2 This is my gun
label2 But we searched the house
label2 Well I guess you missed this, didn't you
label2 There's a situation up here
label2 It's a part of your game
label2 Don't you start with me now
label2 No, no, listen to me
label2 Don't you fucking start with me
label2 I'm telling you the truth now
label2 This is all the game
label2 Bullshit, all right
label2 I know what happened to that guy
label2 What did you see
label2 Think about it
label2 What'd you see
label2 I saw them kill him
label2 Special effects, squibs
label2 Squibs like in the movies
label2 Nicholas
label2 Nicholas, listen
label2 I've got a real gun with real goddamned bullets..
label2 Okay, okay
label2 I'll put it down
label2 He's on the other side of that door
label2 He's an actor
label2 No one's trying to kill you, Nicholas
label2 Please put that gun down
label2 You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life
label2 Nicholas, there was always a safety net
label2 The taxi, there was a diver
label2 It's not true
label2 It is
label2 It's what you hired us for
label2 Nicholas
label2 Please, goddamn it
label2 Conrad
label2 Conrad's there
label2 It's your birthday party
label2 You stop lying
label2 He's got a gun
label2 Get back from the door
label2 You shot him
label2 Someone..
label2 He's dead
label2 We thought you knew
label2 How did you let this get so out of hand
label2 He wouldn't listen to me
label2 We went through this over and over
label2 The mark is your responsibility
label2 I'm sorry
label2 He could have almost killed us
label2 I had a walkietalkie
label2 I used the walkietalkie
label2 We're going to jail
label2 Oh, God
label2 Nicholas
label2 We've got him
label2 He's in the bag
label2 He came in right on target
label2 Keep everyone back until we clear away the breakaway glass
label2 It's just breakaway glass, but it can still cut you
label2 Just gonna take a look at you
label2 I'm gonna check your pulse
label2 That was quite a fall
label2 Happy birthday, Nickie
label2 What is this
label2 It's your birthday present
label2 I had to do something
label2 You were becoming such an asshole
label2 Ladies and gentlemen
label2 Amazing
label2 I just wanted to tell you
label2 Great job
label2 This was the best ever
label2 Because if you didn't,  I was supposed to throw you off
label2 Thanks
label2 We have to head home
label2 We just wanted to say goodbye
label2 Rachel
label2 I'm sorry about your car
label2 I..
label2 I think I left it at the zoo
label2 No problem
label2 Happy birthday, Nicholas
label2 I really will
label2 Nicholas, I haven't a clue what this is all about

label2 <i>Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist was able to play the victim...</i>  <i>...the brave journalist going up against the bad guy.</i>  <i>I don't know why malicious intent couldn't be proven.</i>  <i> When you call a guy a criminal  If you want to say these things</i>  <i>Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity.</i>  <i>There's really no greater disgrace for a journalist than libel.</i>  <i> Was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel.</i>  Can I get that sandwich there
label2 And a black coffee
label2 <i>In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed...</i>  <i>Wennerström, founder and president of the Wennerström Group...</i>  <i>...used state funds intended for industrial development in Poland...</i>  <i>...in an arms deal with the rightwing Ustase in Croatia.</i>  <i>I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist
label2 Yeah
label2 Where have you been
label2 Thinking
label2 Smoking
label2 Yeah
label2 TV4 called
label2 I told them no statement...  ...until we've read the judgment in its entirety
label2 Well, I have
label2 Anyone else
label2 Everyone who wants to see you humiliated
label2 Been on the phone all morning
label2 You are
label2 You wrote it
label2 I read it
label2 I ran it
label2 Our credibility isn't dead yet
label2 Mine is
label2 I'm tired
label2 I'm gonna go home, crawl under the duvet for a week
label2 Thank you
label2 It's possible we could wait forever
label2 You called her and spoke to her
label2 <i>No one here particularly likes her.</i>  I find it's much better if she works from home
label2 But you told her I wanted to meet with her
label2 I've told her many times I prefer her not to meet clients
label2 <i> You like her
label2 Very much.</i>  <i>She's one of the best investigators I have, as you saw from her report.</i>   But
label2 She's different
label2 In what way
label2 In every way
label2 <i>Miss Salander is here.</i>  Lisbeth
label2 Mr. Dirch Frode
label2 Something wrong with the report
label2 But I'm also interested in what's not in it
label2 There's nothing not in it
label2 Your opinion of him isn't
label2 I'm not paid to give my opinion
label2 So you don't have one
label2 He's clean, in my opinion
label2 He's who he presents himself to be
label2 In his business, that's an asset
label2 Well, there's less in his asset column after his conviction today
label2 He made a fool of himself
label2 If it happened that way
label2 That was never part of my assignment
label2 But you're right
label2 He did make a fool of himself professionally
label2 How much of a fool did he make of himself financially
label2 The judgment will just about empty his savings
label2 May I go
label2 Your report is light in another area
label2 His personal life
label2 Nothing that warranted inclusion
label2 Does that mean yes or no
label2 I think what Miss Salander means, and I agree, is that everyone has a right...  ...to a certain amount of privacy, even if they're being investigated
label2 Not in this case
label2 I need to know anything about him..
label2 He's had a longstanding sexual relationship...  ...with his coeditor of the magazine
label2 It wrecked his marriage but not hers
label2 Sometimes he performs cunnilingus
label2 Not often enough, in my opinion
label2 No, you're right not to include that
label2 I know
label2 You needed your sister
label2 She offered
label2 He declined
label2 Never a good idea
label2 Mixing family and business
label2 I would've lost anyway
label2 It wasn't about Mikael
label2 It was about Wennerström sending a message...  ...to the press and the FSA, saying, "Don't ask questions.
label2 Cheer up
label2 Nilla, you don't have to worry about me
label2 Mom's worried
label2 About the money
label2 Good evening
label2 Nilla
label2 What are you doing
label2 Nothing
label2 I don't wanna talk about it since I know you won't approve
label2 Of...
label2 Nilla
label2 Light of Life
label2 Hello
label2 Herr Blomkvist
label2 <i> Yeah
label2 I represent Henrik Vanger
label2 Perhaps you've heard of him
label2 <i>He'd love to talk to you about a private matter.</i>  This is an awkward moment
label2 <i>Oh, I'm sorry
label2 I'm about to sit down to a Christmas dinner myself.</i>  No, that's not exactly what I meant
label2 You're referring to your recent legal problems
label2 That has provided us with much amusement
label2 I'm sorry
label2 <i>Herr Vanger has little love for Herr Wennerström either.</i>   Have him call me
label2 But he would love to speak to you...  ...in person, if possible
label2 <i> In Hedestad
label2 That's not gonna be possible.</i>  <i>Herr Blomkvist, he's far too old to go to Stockholm
label2 Please.</i>  Be so kind as to consider
label2 <i>Hedestad is lovely in the winter.</i>  I'll call you back on this number
label2 I'm sorry
label2 What are you doing
label2 I'm writing a press release
label2 Saying
label2 You're taking over as publisher, you're very sorry...  ...for any nuisance Mr. Wennerström was caused...  ...and I can't be reached for comment
label2 Are you giving up
label2 This makes me sick
label2 First time in Hedestad
label2 And the last
label2 Oh, don't say that
label2 You said it would be lovely in the winter
label2 Well, this is unseasonable
label2 Well, I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm
label2 I'm joking  You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish
label2 Welcome
label2 Come inside
label2 It's warm
label2 How do you do
label2 You used to run one of the largest industrial firms in the country
label2 "Used to.
label2 That's correct
label2 Should I stay
label2 No
label2 My grandfather forged the tracks...  ...that the 4:30 train will take you home on
label2 We stitched this country together
label2 We made the steel, milled the lumber that built modern Sweden
label2 And what do you think our most profitable product now is
label2 Fertilizer
label2 But I am with the settling of accounts
label2 And the clock is ticking
label2 I need your help
label2 I'm Doing what
label2 But what you'll really be doing...  ...is solving a mystery by doing what you do so well
label2 Your recent legal mishap notwithstanding
label2 My family
label2 Would you like to sit
label2 Did you make it
label2 Have you something for me
label2 I am on welfare, I do not administer it
label2 This is not enough
label2 No, thank you
label2 <i>This is Harriet.</i>  The granddaughter of my brother Richard
label2 Richard was a Nazi of the first order...  ...joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17
label2 Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word "freedom"
label2 Yes, I know
label2 Okay
label2 Missed all the real excitement
label2 But not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife, Margareta...  ...and their son, Gottfried
label2 Now, Gottfried, Harriet's father...  ...was what they used to call a goodtime Charlie
label2 Do they
label2 Okay
label2 He was a charmer, a ladies' man and a drunk
label2 In other words, a born salesman
label2 Which he did for the company...  ...traveling around and taking clients out to dinner
label2 Well, somebody's gotta do it
label2 That's right
label2 Drowned, drunk, here on the island
label2 Martin, who runs Vanger Industries, now that I'm retired
label2 That's right, I Googled him
label2 And Harriet
label2 She was bright, curious...  ...a winning combination in any person
label2 And beautiful
label2 Something happened to her
label2 Someone in the family murdered Harriet...  ...and for the past 40 years...  ...has been trying to drive me insane
label2 <i>It was September 24th, 1966.</i>  A Saturday
label2 Harriet was 16
label2 My brothers...  <i>...and their wives and their children and grandchildren...</i>  <i>...were all gathered here...</i>  <i>...for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner.</i>  <i>It was also the day the yacht club held their autumn parade.</i>  <i>Harriet, with one or two school friends, went into town to see it.</i>  She returned a little after 2:00
label2 She asked if she could talk to me.</i>  I honestly don't remember what I was doing...  ...that I thought was more important...  <i>...but I told her to give me a few minutes.</i>  It was during those few minutes that something else occurred
label2 <i>The accident had nothing to do with Harriet...</i>  ...and yet everything
label2 <i>It was chaos as everybody put down what they were doing.</i>  <i>Police, ambulance, fire brigade...</i>  <i>...reporters, photographers, onlookers all quickly arrived from town...</i>  <i>...just as we on the island, the family, hurried to the bridge from our side.</i>  <i>The driver of the car...</i>  ...a man named Aronsson...  <i>...was pinned and severely injured.</i>  <i>We tried desperately to pry him loose with our hands...</i>  <i>...since metal tools might spark.</i>  <i>It was an hour after the crash that Harriet was in the kitchen.</i>  Anna herself saw her
label2 <i>Well, we finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital.</i>  <i>Just as we from our side...</i>  <i>...slowly drifted back to the house.</i>  <i>The sun was down, the excitement over.</i>  <i>We sat down to dinner.</i>  <i>It was then that I noticed...</i>  <i>...Harriet wasn't there.</i>  <i>And she wasn't there the next morning.</i>  <i>Or the next.</i>  Or the next 40 years
label2 <i>What was she going to tell me?</i>  Why didn't I make time for her
label2 And she couldn't have just run away
label2 No
label2 Not without being seen
label2 Believe me, I checked
label2 She couldn't have just fallen and drowned
label2 No
label2 The currents aren't strong here
label2 Like her father
label2 Oh, no
label2 Someone killed her
label2 Someone on the island that day
label2 Someone close enough to know...  ...what she used to give me each year on my birthday
label2 Those are from her
label2 And the rest, from her killer
label2 Who knows about these
label2 There's me, the police, the killer...  ...and now you
label2 I understand your frustration...  ...but what you're asking me to do, it's a waste of money
label2 But we haven't discussed your fee
label2 Thank you
label2 I can't find something you've been unable to find in 40 years
label2 You don't know that
label2 Here's what I propose:  You come stay on the island
label2 I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use
label2 You study the material I send you
label2 You find something I've missed or you don't
label2 As for compensation, I'll pay you double your salary...  ...for as many months as it takes
label2 Quadruple it if you solve the mystery
label2 Herr Vanger  I'm not done
label2 I will throw in one more thing...  ...even though you're a terrible negotiator
label2 It's something you want more than anything else...  ...and it can't be bought at any price
label2 So let me give it to you
label2 HansErik Wennerström
label2 You were right about him
label2 You just couldn't prove it
label2 We're in the middle of the worst crisis ever, and you're writing a memoir
label2 I need something to do
label2 You fired you
label2 I need you here, not the North Pole
label2 Mikael, you know what this is going to look like
label2 Like I've been gutted
label2 I am
label2 Wennerström wants to see me wave a white flag, not a red flag
label2 If it looks like there's a problem between us, it'll satisfy him
label2 He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down
label2 You're leaving me to fight him alone
label2 It's not the North Pole
label2 Hey, he)'  <i>Network busy
label2 Please try again later.</i>  <i>Network busy
label2 Please try again later.</i>  What
label2 Some milk
label2 Please try again later.</i>  Oh, yeah
label2 These as well
label2 You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter
label2 He doesn't have a daughter
label2 Please
label2 <i>He's had severe cerebral hemorrhaging...</i>  <i>...either from the fall itself or from a stroke that led to the fall.</i>  <i>His blood pressure is still high.</i>  <i>I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness, but that's not assured.</i>  <i>And it's possible, even if he does...</i>  <i>...that there will be neurological damage.</i>  Oh, jeez
label2 Hi
label2 I'm Gunnar
label2 Oh, hey, Gunnar
label2 Come in
label2 Okay
label2 You want to put it in there
label2 Okay
label2 You're an author
label2 That's unfortunate
label2 Bit of trouble, I guess
label2 No jail time though
label2 That's good
label2 No
label2 There
label2 The entire island is owned by my family
label2 Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald...  ...another Nazi, if you can believe
label2 Two in the family
label2 But you'll probably never see him
label2 He's a recluse
label2 He was there that day
label2 Indeed, he was
label2 His daughter, Cecilia, lives over there
label2 Does anybody speak to anybody on this island
label2 Actually, Isabella, Harriet's mother, who lives there...  ...she speaks to Harald, which is one of the reasons I don't speak to her
label2 Right
label2 Cecilia's brother, Birger, lives over there
label2 Who doesn't he speak to
label2 But you wouldn't want him to
label2 He can be just as unpleasant as Harald
label2 Quickly losing track of who's who here
label2 Soon you will know us all only too well
label2 With my apologies
label2 Now, out there, my grandnephew Martin's house, Harriet's brother
label2 Who speaks to him
label2 I speak to him
label2 He runs the company now, as I think I told you
label2 Gunnar, probably
label2 Oh, yes, I met him earlier
label2 He was 19 when Harriet disappeared
label2 Well, he lives over there
label2 Sorry
label2 Your house
label2 Oh, yes
label2 The man who hires the detective...  ...should always be kept on the suspects list
label2 Her mother
label2 But what about the search
label2 Please
label2 I beg you
label2 <i>The fact that I never found a body was not surprising.</i>  <i>You can't dig up an entire island.</i>  But neither could I find the motive
label2 Was it spontaneous
label2 Was it calculated
label2 Was it about business
label2 Business
label2 Well, she was 16
label2 And very bright
label2 Henrik told me and many others he could easily see her...  ...running the company one day
label2 She told them she was feeling unwell
label2 But they also told me she kept secrets from them too
label2 The main thing I learned was that teenage girls are complicated
label2 I have one
label2 Then you know
label2 I wanted to...  ...ask you about this
label2 I've studied it more times than I can say
label2 I know every page of it
label2 It's the last page I was curious about
label2 As was I
label2 It's a list of names, numbers and it must have some significance
label2 All local phone numbers
label2 The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosmarie Larsson...  ...an elderly woman who died some years before
label2 The other three were not connected in any way that I could find
label2 I reminded you of things you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry
label2 I can't forget
label2 I don't know what that is
label2 Every policeman has at least one unsolved case to obsess over
label2 Year after year, he kept going back to this Rebecka case
label2 Taking out the files, studying them over and over
label2 We were young
label2 We laughed at him
label2 And that was also a missinggirl case
label2 No, no, no, that's not why I mention it
label2 <i>Poor old Torstensson never solved it.</i>  <i>And he never let it go.</i>  So how's Mr. Palmgren doing
label2 I heard he had a stroke of some kind
label2 It's terrible
label2 Now, what exactly do you do at this security company
label2 But not fulltime
label2 Not even parttime consistently
label2 They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August
label2 How much do you make there
label2 How much is your rent
label2 I Pay my rent
label2 Never
label2 You think that thing through your eyebrow makes you attractive
label2 There's a discrepancy between the obligation...  ...of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances
label2 There's no discrepancy
label2 It was clear I could manage my own finances
label2 That is not clear to me
label2 I'm not a child
label2 You are not
label2 But you were
label2 And between then and now, you were committed...  ...to the locked ward of St. Stefan's where you continued...  ...to display violent aggression
label2 And it's not even that long ago
label2 You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking that you have changed...  ...but when I'm looking at this...  ...not to mention the way you're looking at me now..
label2 ...I don't think you have
label2 So the good old Mr. Palmgren days are over
label2 You'll provide me with receipts for your expenses
label2 If the numbers don't balance, I assume the difference is going to drugs
label2 I've taken care of myself since I was 10
label2 Miss Salander, please, look at me, this is important
label2 Since your behavior is elaborately documented in here...  ...it will shock no one if I chose an alternative...  ...to the very lenient arrangement I have just outlined
label2 Would you prefer institutionalization
label2 Mikael
label2 Yes
label2 Oh, hi
label2 We're going to the same place
label2 Hop in
label2 I found him at death's door, halfway up the hill
label2 I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape
label2 It's a climb for anyone
label2 I should've warned you
label2 Come in
label2 Henrik says great things about you
label2 Leave your shoes on
label2 Martin
label2 Smells wonderful
label2 What a place
label2 Look at that view
label2 I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Göteborg
label2 When it was sold, I went with it
label2 I live in Hong Kong, but come back to Stockholm for family events
label2 And I drive up to spend a couple of days with Martin
label2 It's just the moose steak she wants
label2 Who can blame her
label2 It's wonderful
label2 Something's left open
label2 No, no, it's fine
label2 You're writing a book now, Martin said
label2 Henrik's biography
label2 I love Henrik
label2 He's fascinating
label2 Martin too
label2 Yes, they are
label2 You know about Harriet, right
label2 Yes, I do
label2 The family doesn't want to talk about it, but it can't be swept under the rug
label2 Harriet
label2 We can talk about it later
label2 We can talk about it now
label2 Liv knows everything about my crazy family
label2 That's why she'll never marry me
label2 I don't want to read about that in the book
label2 Everything else is fine
label2 Harriet certainly
label2 You know, everything changed after that
label2 How so
label2 We're not Ericsson or Nordea
label2 But we're still the largest familyowned company in the country
label2 We have half of that now
label2 And that downward slide began after my sister's death
label2 It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit...  ...and his heart
label2 You were here that day
label2 I came in later...  ...after the accident on the bridge, with the 4:30 train
label2 A terrible day
label2 And the days after, you know
label2 Searching, not finding
label2 Even worse
label2 This event, Mikael, it has to have a big part in your book
label2 I got a call from social welfare
label2 I've been assigned a new guardian
label2 Hello
label2 I thought I'd come over and say hello
label2 I'm Cecilia
label2 Please, come in
label2 Can I get you some coffee
label2 No, thank you
label2 It's not about the family
label2 It's about Henrik and the company
label2 Like I said
label2 It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone
label2 Unlike the one that landed you in court
label2 Unlike that one, yes
label2 I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but, no, that's by no means my focus
label2 Those boxes that Gunnar carted down here...  ...which are where, in the closet now
label2 I wonder sometimes who's crazier, my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle
label2 Since we're talking about her...  ...since you brought her up, what was she like
label2 What was Harriet like
label2 I'm sure Henrik has told you
label2 He was my age back then
label2 You were the same age
label2 My sister Anita was closer to her in age
label2 She knew Harriet better than anyone
label2 You should talk to her
label2 I'd love to
label2 If I had to guess, London
label2 You don't know where your sister lives
label2 I haven't seen her in years
label2 I'm getting used to that comment
label2 She left
label2 Moved to London, that was it
label2 You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit
label2 I'll track her down for you
label2 You're backed up, aren't you
label2 Hard drive at home, yeah
label2 Okay
label2 That's good, because this one's done
label2 <i>Have you ever had any sexually transmitted diseases?</i>  <i>And when was the last time that you were tested for HIV?</i>  <i>How many partners have you had in the last month?</i>  And how many of those were men
label2 It's regulation, I have to ask these things
label2 Write what you want
label2 And why do you need such an expensive computer
label2 For work
label2 Making coffee, sorting mail
label2 I should have control of my money
label2 Once you learn to be sociable, get along with people
label2 Why don't we start with that now, huh
label2 Why don't we start with me
label2 You do something for me, I do something for you
label2 That's what normal people do
label2 I want you to have that computer
label2 Feel that
label2 That's gabardine
label2 And...  And..
label2 I like the reticence
label2 <i>Anita Vanger.</i>   Through there
label2 Thank you
label2 Excuse me
label2 I probably should have made an appointment
label2 No, it's fine
label2 Thank you
label2 Mikael
label2 Mikael
label2 How do you do
label2 So you're looking for investment counseling
label2 Well, I would be if I had any money
label2 I'm sorry, I don't understand
label2 I'm writing a biography of your Uncle Henrik
label2 That's why I'm here
label2 I haven't seen him in over 20 years
label2 Haven't seen my sister, haven't seen anyone in that family
label2 Most of what I'm writing about predates that...  ...so your recollections are valid
label2 I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question
label2 Well, then let me narrow it down
label2 Harriet
label2 Everything that I know about that I told to whatever his name was
label2 Morell
label2 My recollections were a lot better then
label2 I just want to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like
label2 She was very messed up
label2 Well, just like all us Vanger kids, really, but...  Crazy mother
label2 At least her father wasn't a Nazi
label2 Was he abusive
label2 Mine
label2 No, hers
label2 Some days she'd be very withdrawn
label2 And then the next minute she'd be putting on makeup...  ...and wearing the tightest sweater that she had to school
label2 No Vanger was ever religious
label2 Can you imagine
label2 She was obviously very unhappy
label2 What do you think happened to her
label2 Everyone knows what
label2 All that I know is that I felt really sorry for her
label2 I got away when I was 18 and I never went back
label2 But she never made it to 18
label2 <i>Mr
label2 Bjurman, please
label2 It's Lisbeth Salander.</i>  <i>Hold for a moment, please.</i>  <i>Lisbeth, I haven't seen you Are you well?</i>  I'm fine
label2 <i>Something the matter?</i>  No, no, nothing to be concerned about
label2 Actually, I need another advance on my allowance
label2 Can I come to your office tonight
label2 <i>I don't work at night, Lisbeth.</i>  <i>Why don't you come to my house, huh
label2 Do you have a pen?</i>  I don't need a pen

label2 It's me.</i>  Lisbeth
label2 Come on in
label2 It's nice
label2 It's home
label2 What do you need money for this time
label2 Food
label2 I'm so glad you decided to come and visit
label2 I just want my money
label2 Well, let's see if we can help you out with that
label2 Wait
label2 Is there a problem
label2 I just want to know...  ...am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat
label2 I forgot to ask you:  You like anal sex
label2 <i>Faith is the assurance of things hoped for...</i>  <i>...the evidence of things not seen
label2 Through faith we understand...</i>  <i>...that the world was created by the word of God.</i>   I'll drive you home
label2 I can get home on my own
label2 Is it any warmer inside
label2 No
label2 I apologize if you've been having financial problems...  ...at the magazine during Mikael's absence
label2 We'll work through them
label2 How long do you think you can hang on
label2 Six months
label2 That sounds about right
label2 I used to be in the newspaper business
label2 We owned six dailies back in the '50s
label2 <i> The Courier, here in town
label2 Which I let my nephew, Birger, run...</i>  ...because he can't run anything else
label2 So, what would you say to taking on a partner
label2 We value our independence very much
label2 Independence in publishing is dependent on advertisers
label2 However much you have, you retain
label2 Excuse me
label2 Did I miss something
label2 Talking about investing in the magazine
label2 But why
label2 Not out of greed, that's for sure
label2 I feel badly that I've taken Mikael away from you at the worst possible time
label2 But now I am convinced that this is the right thing to do
label2 The moral thing
label2 That's one reason
label2 And...  And...
label2 How long have you been discussing this with them
label2 I haven't
label2 They called yesterday and asked me to come up
label2 Why didn't you tell me
label2 You live in the woods
label2 I wanted to hear what they had to say
label2 You would've said no before they could
label2 It's a bad idea
label2 You heard me tell them we had six months
label2 I lied
label2 We will be out of business in three
label2 But you don't know this family like I do
label2 They're crazy
label2 If we do this, that's exactly what we're doing
label2 So you wanna say no, let's say no
label2 Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing
label2 What
label2 I'm leaving this godforsaken island in the morning
label2 So are you coming to bed or not

label2 I don't like bullies
label2 Are you referring to Mr. Wennerström
label2 I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue his enemies into submission

label2 September, 1966

label2 Is this about Harriet Vanger
label2 Everyone here grows up knowing about her
label2 It's how we're taught about strangers
label2 Lisbeth
label2 I need to pay my rent
label2 Oh, come on in
label2 I feel a bit badly how we left it last time
label2 Me too
label2 Good
label2 You recognize this
label2 I had it with me last time
label2 I set it here, remember
label2 And this snap, you see it
label2 It's a wideangle fiberoptics lens
label2 But I misjudged just how sick you are
label2 Okay

label2 Nod
label2 After that you will never contact me again
label2 How "sociable" I'm becoming
label2 Then you will negotiate with the court...  ...to have my declaration of incompetence lifted
label2 If you fail, this video will spread across the internet like a virus
label2 Nod
label2 And if anything should happen to me, if I get run over by a car...  ...if you run me over with a car, this will upload automatically

label2 I'm taking the keys to this apartment because I'll be checking on you
label2 If I find a girl in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not...  No, not the video
label2 I'll kill you
label2 Do you doubt what's in the reports that have followed me around all my life
label2 What do they say
label2 If you had to sum it up
label2 They say I'm insane
label2 I am insane
label2 Nod
label2 I know it's going to be hard for you to abide by my rules
label2 The abstinence part most of all
label2 So I'm going to make it easier for you
label2 Lie still
label2 I've never done this before
label2 Hi
label2 Hi
label2 On my way to Skelleftea
label2 I can only stay a couple of hours
label2 What's in Skelleftea
label2 Bible camp
label2 Oh, yeah
label2 It's fine, Nilla
label2 Whatever you want to do is fine
label2 Everybody needs something
label2 Just as long as it's not God
label2 I didn't say that
label2 And I apologize for that
label2 That's what I'm doing
label2 <i>It should've been me visiting you.</i>   I'm sorry
label2 It's okay
label2 It was nice seeing you
label2 Byebye   I'll see you
label2 Yeah
label2 Oh, don't go too hard on the Catholics
label2 The what
label2 The article you're writing
label2 Oh, I'm not writing an article about Catholics
label2 The Bible quotes by your desk
label2 Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist
label2 How are you?</i>  <i>Not still freezing in Hedestad, I hope, for your sake.</i>  You know that Rebecka case you mentioned
label2 <i>Would you recall her last name?</i>  Of course I do
label2 But what has that to do with anything
label2 <i> Nothing, probably
label2 Jacobsson
label2 <i>Her arms were cutoff and she was burned.</i>  <i>But all that happened in the 1940s.</i>  <i> What have you found
label2 I have to call you back.</i>  <i>Why?</i>   Is it Henrik
label2 We were talking
label2 He rubbed his arm, then he collapsed
label2 I honestly don't know
label2 You go
label2 Talk to you later
label2 Evening
label2 So how is he
label2 Well, the good news is he survived
label2 How he does now, we'll have to see
label2 He's in intensive care
label2 Right
label2 May I have one of those
label2 Small Scotch
label2 Sure
label2 Thank you
label2 I hate to be indelicate, but Henrik promised me something...  ...when I agreed to do this
label2 I need to know what he has on him
label2 Now
label2 In case..
label2 In case he dies
label2 And I apologize
label2 I don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me
label2 And he can't tell you in the condition he's in, so...  We also didn't discuss who I'd report to if something should happen to him
label2 Oh, well, you'd report to me, of course
label2 No
label2 No, we don't know that
label2 What do you mean
label2 I may have found something
label2 What have you found
label2 ...I lost my life savings
label2 I need a research assistant
label2 Can you authorize that
label2 Yes
label2 Do you have one in mind
label2 I can find someone
label2 I know an excellent one
label2 The what
label2 Well, you don't think we can hire just anyone...  ...without doing a background check
label2 I want to read that
label2 The investigator's name
label2 That is her name, yes
label2 See, I can't find any record of her, and I'm pretty good at that
label2 Would it matter what her name is
label2 If I wanted to speak to her, yes
label2 You sure
label2 Just like your sources
label2 You understand
label2 Okay
label2 My sister
label2 She's also my lawyer
label2 She'll be contacting you
label2 The reason you can find no record of her is because her records are sealed
label2 She's a ward of the state
label2 What's that gotta do with anything
label2 Can we please not make it any rougher
label2 Who is it
label2 It's Mikael Blomkvist
label2 Actually, I'm not really up yet
label2 Please
label2 Hi
label2 You and I need to talk
label2 I've got us some breakf  I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had some company
label2 I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do
label2 Why don't you put some clothes on, get rid of your girlfriend
label2 We need to talk
label2 I'm sorry, you have to go
label2 Do you need me to stay
label2 No
label2 Bye
label2 Bye
label2 Bye
label2 Sorry
label2 I guess I must have alarmed you, turning up like that
label2 If you touch me, I'll more than alarm you
label2 That won't be necessary
label2 Your report, very detailed
label2 It wasn't meant to be
label2 When I write about people, I try to entertain the reader
label2 Wennerström wasn't entertained much
label2 You gonna sit down
label2 That's the word he used, "sensitive.
label2 I'm gonna use "illegal"...  ...because that's what it was when you hacked into my computer
label2 No, I'm not gonna do anything about that
label2 I could, but I won't
label2 What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tell you a story...  ...and if it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research further
label2 And if not, I'll do the washing up and you'll never see me again
label2 Here, you should eat that
label2 What kind of research
label2 I want you to help me catch a killer of women
label2 <i>I've got R.J.</i>  Rebecka Jacobsson
label2 What we've gotta do is find out who they are, what happened to them...  ...and what these Leviticus verses have to do with anything
label2 What are you doing
label2 You can keep talking if you want
label2 Don't you need to look over these
label2 I got it
label2 Cat
label2 How'd you get in
label2 No one has asked me about Magda in over 40 years
label2 It interests me
label2 Does it
label2 <i>Her husband was the first suspect.</i>  <i>The husband is always the first suspect and usually the last.</i>  But not this time
label2 We moved on to a neighbor
label2 Then a vagrant
label2 How exactly was she killed
label2 Miss...
label2 Salander
label2 Miss Salander
label2 I hope you don't mind me asking, but when did you last eat
label2 I can't put on weight
label2 <i>If a man's offering is a lamb, it shall be a female without blemish.</i>  <i>He should lay his hand upon its head...</i>  <i>...slaughter it, empty its blood on the base of the altar...</i>  <i>...and he shall be forgiven.</i>   How is he
label2 He needs surgery...  ...but there's no DNR in place
label2 So it's up to the family to decide...  ...should the occasion arise, whether to resuscitate or not
label2 And they're not good at decisions
label2 She said yes
label2 Do you think I might be able to see him
label2 He was asleep the last time I looked, but let me check
label2 Thank you
label2 Tell him to pack his things and leave
label2 Mother, please
label2 Don't use that tone with me
label2 We should put this to a vote
label2 Don't be an idiot, Birger
label2 We all know what Henrik wants
label2 Can we just do that
label2 Henrik is fighting for his life in there
label2 Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger, there is no smoking in here
label2 Go back to Stockholm
label2 When we need a family chronicle written by a libelist...  ...we know who to call
label2 All right
label2 This way, miss
label2 <i>If a woman approaches any beast...</i>  <i>...and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast.</i>  <i>Their blood shall be upon them.</i>  <i>My family's impossible.</i>  That's why the company's such a mess
label2 I apologize for my mother's behavior
label2 I'm used to it
label2 It's between her and Henrik
label2 She lost it when my father died, and her drinking and her...  Got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her...  ...and left her excommunicated in the old house...  ...on the other side of the island
label2 She hasn't forgiven him
label2 You must stay
label2 Put this to rest one way or another
label2 I'll keep my mother away
label2 But please, hurry
label2 Lisbeth
label2 I'll get that
label2 It's okay
label2 Martin Vanger
label2 How do you do
label2 Fine
label2 It's a girlfriend, or...
label2 Assistant
label2 Good night
label2 Problems finding the place
label2 Everyone in town knows who and where you are
label2 That's comforting
label2 Are you hungry
label2 No
label2 I used to have a motorbike, a Triumph
label2 I know
label2 The five cases from Harriet's list
label2 And five more she missed
label2 Rebecka was the first, just as you thought
label2 The second, M.H., is Mari Holmberg, a prostitute in Kalmar...  ...murdered in 1954, matching Leviticus 20:18
label2 Right
label2 "if a man lies with a woman having her sickness...  ...he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered...  ...the fountain of her blood.
label2 Raped and stabbed, but cause of death was suffocation by sanitary napkin
label2 R.L
label2 Rakel Lunde, 1957
label2 Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped
label2 Head crushed with a rock
label2 Leviticus 20:27
label2 "A woman who is a medium or sorceress...  ...shall be put to death by stoning.
label2 Sara Witt, 1964
label2 Daughter of a pastor
label2 Tied to her bed
label2 Raped
label2 Charred in the fire that burned down her house
label2 "The daughter of a priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot...  ...profanes her father and shall be burned with fire.
label2 Magda Lovisa Sjöberg, 1960
label2 Found in a barn
label2 Stabbed and raped with farm tools
label2 The cow in the next stall had its throat slit
label2 Its blood was splashed on her and hers on it
label2 "If a woman lies with any beast...  ...you shall kill the woman and the beast
label2 Their blood is upon them.
label2 Found by her sister in their pet shop
label2 Raped, beaten
label2 The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums
label2 There was a parakeet inside her
label2 A runaway
label2 Raped, strangled
label2 A burnt pigeon tied around her neck
label2 Lena Andersson, 1967
label2 Raped, stabbed, decapitated   Okay
label2 I'm not finished
label2 We're looking for a serial murderer...  ...but what could that have to do with a teenager living on an island
label2 She was looking for him too
label2 <i>Rape
label2 Fire.</i>  Animals
label2 Am I missing anything
label2 The names
label2 They're all Biblical
label2 The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary
label2 Which means they're all Jewish
label2 One thing the Vangers have more than their fair share of, it's antiSemites
label2 There's one right there
label2 I can sleep on a couch
label2 Okay
label2 Right
label2 Good night
label2 Night
label2 Harriet's name isn't
label2 Jewish
label2 No
label2 What are you doing
label2 Reading your notes
label2 Please
label2 Have some coffee
label2 Okay
label2 Then we're gonna have a very serious conversation...  ...about what's yours and what's mine
label2 It's amazing what you figured out with the parade photos
label2 Thank you
label2 Whose
label2 Her
label2 Sorry
label2 Yeah, all right
label2 Close that
label2 No
label2 Not that
label2 Yep
label2 Where the fuck's that
label2 That's down there, isn't it
label2 Oh, yeah, yeah
label2 And...  What does that say there
label2 "N" something "RSJ.
label2 Then something Something "RIF.
label2 "Carpentry.
label2 Well, we need to find a carpenter
label2 Fuck
label2 The carpentry shop is gone
label2 I don't recognize him
label2 Sorry
label2 Well, I had to start somewhere
label2 This is Brannlund's kid
label2 Do you know where I might find him
label2 The son
label2 Next to his father at the cemetery
label2 He was killed in an accident on a construction site, years ago
label2 But...  ...she might still be alive
label2 His widow
label2 Do you know where I might find her
label2 Who took these
label2 A local photographer
label2 You were taking pictures too that day...  ...and I'd love to look at them if by some miracle you have them
label2 We were on our honeymoon
label2 But Why
label2 This girl here
label2 Here, you can see her better in the enlargement
label2 Just after this was taken...  ...after she'd seen something across the street, she was murdered
label2 There you are
label2 Thank you
label2 Would you mind if I made a copy of this
label2 No
label2 I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky
label2 So call him
label2 Next time, fill out the proper paperwork
label2 Going down
label2 How's your sex life
label2 I didn't care much for your last report
label2 Let's see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next month's
label2 Don't speak
label2 I don't want to hear your voice, just nod
label2 Start looking for a shrink you can bribe...  ...to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me
label2 And stop visiting tattooremoval websites
label2 Is that dental floss
label2 Yes
label2 You're gonna sterilize that, right
label2 No
label2 What
label2 Thank you
label2 Jesus
label2 Drink
label2 Just be careful
label2 Don't move
label2 You're not a doctor
label2 Take off your wet clothes
label2 What
label2 Yeah
label2 Thank you
label2 Yeah, I think it's stopped bleeding
label2 It still fucking hurts, though
label2 I mean, madness
label2 This is fucking madness
label2 You're okay, you're okay, you're okay
label2 Jesus, that hurts
label2 I mean, these people  Somebody was shooting at me
label2 I mean, it wasn't an accident
label2 No one's shooting at you now
label2 You know, I'm pretty sure this is a bad idea
label2 Why
label2 I'm old and we work together  You work with what'shername and that's worked out for you
label2 You need to stop talking
label2 Oh, shit
label2 Do you want me to open a window
label2 I like working with you too
label2 It could have been a stray shot
label2 Not by Gunnar
label2 If he wanted to shoot him, he wouldn't be here
label2 They shoot at anything that moves
label2 Or he's right, Dirch
label2 What if he is
label2 This has to stop
label2 Do you want to stop, Mikael
label2 What I don't have is Vanger Industries' records
label2 That's what I want
label2 Why
label2 Will you authorize it
label2 Well, how far back
label2 Henrik said I could have access to everything
label2 This is what I need
label2 That's not what he meant
label2 I'll sign a nondisclosure statement
label2 Just a minute
label2 To protect him from himself
label2 It's insane
label2 What have we got to hide
label2 After 120 years of business, probably a lot
label2 If this is what he needs to finish, he should have permission
label2 What am I looking for
label2 And everything about Frode
label2 Your father was taking pictures that day that no one has seen
label2 So ask him
label2 I was wondering if you could do that
label2 I don't speak to him
label2 Could you make an exception in my case
label2 Are you afraid to be in the same room with him
label2 I'm not saying you shouldn't be
label2 Sorry
label2 Please
label2 Are you finished
label2 You already have everything
label2 No, I don't
label2 Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships or suppliers
label2 You'll have to do without
label2 Mr. Frode said I have access...  ...to whatever I need
label2 I need this  You have access to this floor
label2 Thank you for seeing me
label2 Come in
label2 Tea
label2 Please
label2 Sven Olov Lindholm
label2 Handsome
label2 Me
label2 Per Engdahl
label2 But your interest is in my more candid photographic work
label2 Friends, relations, that kind of thing
label2 "Blom" or "Bloom"
label2 Blomkvist
label2 I'm not a recluse
label2 I don't close my door to anybody
label2 They just don't visit
label2 Well...  ...perhaps if you redecorated
label2 Hide the past like they do
label2 Under a thin, shiny veneer
label2 I am the most honest of all of them
label2 The family
label2 Sweden
label2 Some nice landscapes there
label2 Who is this
label2 The blurry one
label2 I can't tell
label2 Oh, that's Gottfried's boy
label2 That's Martin
label2 Yeah
label2 Handsome but useless young man
label2 We're closing
label2 Nowhere near finished
label2 I'm not authorized to stay late
label2 I am
label2 And I need access to everything, including anything that's locked
label2 Call Frode
label2 Leave the keys with the guard
label2 Come on
label2 Mikael
label2 Hi there
label2 Your evening stroll
label2 Yes, that's right, I...   How are you
label2 Good
label2 I stopped by the hospital on my way home
label2 Henrik asked me to ask you something
label2 What was that
label2 I'll make you a drink
label2 Hello, Martin
label2 It's quite windy
label2 What happened to you
label2 When
label2 I fell in the dark
label2 You don't have a flashlight
label2 I'll get you one
label2 I just wasn't being careful, that's all
label2 How's the investigation going
label2 Nothing new to report
label2 Dirch says the girl is really clever
label2 Maybe she'll turn something up
label2 Thank you for that
label2 So, what did he say
label2 What
label2 You said Henrik asked you to ask me something
label2 What
label2 How's the investigation
label2 Oh, yeah
label2 That was his question
label2 Do you hunt
label2 Sure
label2 Nothing at all new to report
label2 No
label2 I can see you're anxious
label2 No
label2 No, I mean to get home after the walk
label2 Yeah, well, I suppose I am
label2 To have dinner with your girlfriend
label2 We'll have better luck with a gun
label2 I'm sorry
label2 When we go hunting
label2 Rather than a knife
label2 I want to show you something
label2 Bring your drink
label2 Leave my knife
label2 <i>Hi, leave a message
label2 I'll call</i>  You know what's harder than shooting someone
label2 Just missing him
label2 That was a very good shot up at the cabin
label2 It didn't work
label2 Mikael, it did work
label2 You're here
label2 Inside
label2 You spilled your drink
label2 May I
label2 How did you do it
label2 What did you find
label2 We can talk or we can just get on with it
label2 Of
label2 You
label2 In an Uppsala prep school blazer
label2 You lied about where you were that day
label2 Did I
label2 Or rather, when
label2 So what
label2 People lie all the time
label2 Lena  That was a long time ago
label2 Where's this photo now
label2 There's a copy on my laptop
label2 There's another copy...  ...on a secure website
label2 Secure website
label2 That's a lie
label2 How much does the girl know
label2 I hope it's as much as you do
label2 That'll make it fun
label2 Where is she
label2 She went this morning
label2 That's a lie
label2 I got a call from our archives manager
label2 She was very perturbed with this girl Lisbeth
label2 I like that name
label2 Lisbeth
label2 I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me
label2 Hey, he)'  So, what do you wanna know
label2 You're a journalist, ask me questions
label2 What do I do with the girls
label2 That's a good question
label2 I like that part a lot
label2 Having a chat when both of you know that one of you is going to die
label2 Unlike my father, who left them scattered...  ...all over the place, like trophies
label2 That's not very smart, if you ask me
label2 Well, he was a loud and garish man
label2 You can't be a sloppy technician like that
label2 You can't drink to excess like he did
label2 This takes discipline
label2 It's a science of a thousand details
label2 It's the cleanup
label2 I guess I don't have to tell you...  ...but you're going to create quite a mess here
label2 Let me ask you something
label2 Why don't people trust their instincts
label2 They sense something is wrong...  ...someone is walking too close behind them
label2 You knew something was wrong
label2 But you came back into the house
label2 Did I force you
label2 No
label2 All I had to do was offer you a drink
label2 It's hard to believe that the fear of offending...  ...can be stronger than the fear of pain, but you know what
label2 And they always come willingly
label2 They know it's all over, just like you do
label2 But somehow, they still think they have a chance
label2 "Maybe if I say the right thing
label2 Maybe if I'm polite
label2 If I cry, if I beg.
label2 ...I can feel myself...  ...getting hard
label2 But, you know, we're not that different, you and I
label2 We both have urges
label2 Satisfying mine...  ...requires more towels
label2 ...I had Irina down here in that cage
label2 Who is Irina, you might ask
label2 Just another girl
label2 Just another immigrant whore
label2 Who misses them
label2 Your sister wasn't
label2 What
label2 You found her
label2 You killed her
label2 You useless fucking detective
label2 This too tight to talk
label2 Good
label2 I'm tired of talking to you
label2 I've never had a man in here before
label2 That was our duty
label2 Harriet's and mine
label2 Hey
label2 There's a gun
label2 There's a gun on the television
label2 Yeah
label2 How come a 23yearold...  ...is a ward of the state
label2 Since when have they said that
label2 Since I was 12
label2 I'm sorry, that's none of my business
label2 I tried to kill my father
label2 Burned him alive
label2 Got about 80 percent of him
label2 I made some coffee
label2 Who's that
label2 I found it in Martin's basement among his souvenirs
label2 No, Martin didn't deny killing anyone
label2 But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused
label2 He got angry at me because I couldn't tell him what had happened to her
label2 He didn't kill her
label2 His father didn't do it
label2 What if she did somehow manage to get away
label2 I mean, if...  ...she is still alive...  ...then there's only one person in this family who'd know where she is
label2 Fuck me
label2 Fuck me
label2 Your turn
label2 Here
label2 Hi
label2 Look, I'm sorry to bother you
label2 What do you want
label2 Has no one called you
label2 Your cousin Martin
label2 What about him
label2 He died in a car accident...  ...last Thursday
label2 I'm not interested in any memorial
label2 Well, I understand
label2 What do you understand
label2 Well, that you don't care very much for your family
label2 Look, I just thought you should know
label2 How'd it go
label2 Okay, I think
label2 She's on
label2 And she's shopping
label2 She's still playing solitaire
label2 No
label2 We have her cell phone too
label2 I was so sure she was gonna lead us to her
label2 Put your hand back in my shirt
label2 She can't
label2 I was just thinking that   Just one second
label2 Okay
label2 What were you going to say
label2 I was just thinking, there could be one other possibility
label2 Well, we could, absolutely
label2 What is it now
label2 So you sent the flowers
label2 Yes, I did
label2 But the family never knew, did they
label2 No
label2 So I'm guessing she then came here on her marriedname passport...  ...and you followed on her maidenname passport
label2 No, actually, it was the other way around
label2 She thought that it was safer if I traveled with Spencer myself
label2 Nothing
label2 Only that he loved her
label2 She said, "if you love me, you'll do this and not ask why.
label2 And they both died 20 years ago
label2 Car accident
label2 You found that out too
label2 Is that you
label2 I was 14 the first time he raped me
label2 Martin
label2 No, my father
label2 Well, why didn't you tell somebody
label2 My mother
label2 Henrik would've done something
label2 I almost told him
label2 But I was afraid because of what I'd done
label2 I...  You still don't understand, do you
label2 He quoted from the Bible as he tore my clothes off
label2 <i>He tied a belt around my neck.</i>  He wanted to kill me
label2 I got out of the house
label2 <i>I went down to the dock.</i>  He came staggering after me
label2 I could never fight him off in a small space...  <i>...but out in the open...</i>  ...I was strong enough to deal with an old drunk
label2 When it was over..
label2 <i>...I looked up and Martin was standing there, staring at me.</i>  And all I'd accomplished was substitute one for another
label2 <i>And then I saw him the day of the parade...</i>  <i>...across the street.</i>  <i>And I knew that it would never be over.</i>  So how did you escape
label2 Anita
label2 She...  She insisted that I leave everything behind
label2 <i>As everyone ate dinner, I was no more than 20 meters away from them.</i>  <i>I spent the night there
label2 That's when the search started.</i>  <i>In the morning, she came to get me.</i>  <i>I'd grown up with that bridge as my link to home...</i>  <i>...but all I could think is...</i>  ...if I could just get away from them...  <i>...just get past the police...</i>  <i>...then I might be safe.</i>  <i>And I was.</i>  Until you showed up
label2 You're safe now
label2 How did you get away
label2 Someone saved me too   How are you feeling
label2 Thank you, Anna
label2 I made you a promise...  ...whether you found anything or not
label2 What's this
label2 Hello, Henrik
label2 I barely remember Wennerström working here, much less being fired  How could you
label2 You're referring to the statute of limitations...  ...but I had no idea this is what Henrik was holding out
label2 If I had, I never would've let him bring you up here
label2 He wasn't trying to deceive you
label2 He knows you can't try somebody 35 years after the event
label2 I like Henrik, but he knows that
label2 A man's reputation means something
label2 He thought you could destroy Wennerström...  ...in the court of public opinion
label2 The court of public opinion...  ...celebrates people's bad behavior
label2 He's an elderly man
label2 He promised me Wennerström's carcass on a plate
label2 I can't do anything with this
label2 Yes, of course
label2 What happened with Wennerström
label2 How did he get you
label2 I heard something
label2 I got it from an anonymous source...  ...who I'm now sure was one of Wennerström's lackeys
label2 It was fake
label2 Which he easily proved in court
label2 You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life...  ...was illegal and immoral
label2 I did some work on my own on him...  ...before you hired me
label2 I haven't looked at it all...  ...because you and HarrietfuckingVanger...  ...have kept me busy
label2 But I may have something
label2 You may have something
label2 Maybe
label2 They launder money from arms and drug sales...  ...and crime syndicates in Russia
label2 And that money accounts for all but 5 percent of his holdings
label2 The rest ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands
label2 This time you don't want to know
label2 This time I do want to know
label2 I have access to his computer
label2 And how do you have that
label2 I could've gotten it from a source inside the company
label2 You didn't
label2 And what will you say to me
label2 Well, that depends if you really want to know
label2 I do
label2 Mikael, how did you get access
label2 <i>Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist...</i>  <i>...who, this time last year was convicted of libel...</i>  <i>...in a Stockholm courtroom...</i>  <i>...doesn't seem to have learned from his mistakes.</i>  <i>Or maybe he has.</i>  <i>In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges...</i>  <i>...the company that sued him, the Wennerström Group...</i>  The shit hits the fan
label2 Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta, which won't wash
label2 The police will investigate, Fl will investigate
label2 Maybe he'll go to prison
label2 You think
label2 Probably not
label2 What's wrong with you
label2 It's embarrassing
label2 Tell me
label2 I need to borrow some money
label2 Fifty thousand
label2 I have a chance to make an investment
label2 I really don't think I've got 50,000
label2 Yes, you do
label2 I'm sorry that I know that
label2 You'll get the money back, I promise
label2 Okay
label2 Okay
label2 You want a coffee
label2 All of it.</i>  <i>The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite as certain as Mr. Wennerström of that.</i>  <i>If a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist alleges proves to be true...</i>  <i>...not only will there be a securities investigation...</i>  <i>...but an organizedcrime inquiry as well.</i>  <i>Mr
label2 Blomkvist names no sources.</i>  <i>And we can't force him to
label2 But we can look for them.</i>  <i> Beginning where
label2 Those closest to Mr. Wennerström.</i>  <i>Only someone in the inner circle of a corporation like this...</i>  <i>...has access to this kind of information.</i>  <i>Mr
label2 Wennerström isn't available for comment...</i>  <i>...but I'm happy to answer questions.</i>  <i> Where is he
label2 Has he left the country?</i>  <i>I don't think so.</i>   Okay
label2 Thank you
label2 Thank you
label2 May I have your passport, please
label2 <i>With his failure to appear...</i>  <i>...before a Security Exchange Commission panel...</i>  <i>...a warrant has been issued for the Wennerström Group CEO.</i>  <i>I can confirm that he left Sweden...</i>  <i>...on a private jet that landed in Paris last week.</i>  <i>Whether he's still there, we don't know.</i>  <i>He can be anywhere by now.</i>  Thank you
label2 I have accounts at Bank of Kroenenfeld, Cayman Islands
label2 I'd like to transfer them and convert to bonds
label2 Naturally, you have the clearing codes
label2 Naturally
label2 Thirty
label2 This will take some time
label2 You will receive 4 percent commission
label2 I will
label2 Then it won't be a waste of it
label2 All 50, into five accounts
label2 That looks correct
label2 <i>The man who is now being called Sweden's Charles Ponzi...</i>  <i>...may no longer have a country to call home...</i>  <i>...but does have enough money to buy one.</i>  <i>According to the International Banking Commission...</i>  <i>Wennerström, a week after the Millennium article appeared</i>  <i>...on newsstands, began emptying accounts...</i>  <i>...at Bank of Kroenenfeld in the Cayman Islands.</i>  <i>That money, approximately 2 billion euros...</i>  <i>...was then spread over a number of accounts...</i>  <i>...with the help of this confederate, seen here in Zurich.</i>   Hey
label2 Hey
label2 The money I borrowed
label2 Already
label2 Thank you
label2 No, I quit
label2 It was a good investment
label2 It was okay
label2 I'm seeing my daughter
label2 Okay
label2 You look nice
label2 I'll see you soon
label2 <i>Mr
label2 Wennerström won the libel case..</i>  You got that call in the office
label2 I miss our meetings
label2 I'm sure you don't
label2 I was always such a headache for you
label2 Never showing up with good news, only problems
label2 I have good news now
label2 I made a friend
label2 I mean, one that you'd approve of
label2 <i>A man who authorities here in Marbella have confirmed...</i>  <i>...is fugitive HansErik Wennerström, shot three times in the head...</i>  <i>...in what police are calling a classic gangland execution.</i>  <i>The investigation into Wennerström's ties...</i>  <i>...to crime organizations worldwide will now turn into speculation.</i>  <i>Which of them caught up with him before Swedish authorities could?</i>  <i>Wennerström spent the last days of his flamboyant life...</i>   It's nice
label2 Your father
label2 A friend
label2 Must be a very good friend
label2 We're late
label2 That can't possibly be true
label2 It is
label2 What would account for that
label2 Well, first, an awful lot of people live in China, but here's my question
label2 I didn't know they take SATs in China
label2 They don't
label2 I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about me
label2 Yes
label2 I could sing in an a Capella group, but I can't sing
label2 Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong
label2 I could row crew or invent a $25 PC
label2 Or I get into a final club
label2 You know, from a woman's perspective,  sometimes not singing in an a Capella group is a good thing
label2 On the other hand, I do like guys who row crew
label2 Well, I can't do that
label2 I was kidding
label2 And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test
label2 Have you ever tried
label2 To row crew
label2 To get into a final club
label2 No
label2 Are you, like, whatever, delusional
label2 Maybe it's just sometimes you say two things at once
label2 I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to be aiming at
label2 But you've seen guys who row crew, right
label2 No
label2 They're worldclass athletes
label2 And a second ago, you said you like guys who row crew  so I assumed you had met one
label2 I guess I just meant I like the idea of it
label2 Okay
label2 Should we get something to eat
label2 Would you like to talk about something else
label2 No
label2 It's just since the beginning of the conversation about finals club,  I think I may have missed a birthday
label2 There are really more people in China with genius IQs than the entire population..
label2 The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc
label2 Which one
label2 It's the best of the best
label2 Which Roosevelt
label2 Theodore
label2 Is it true that they send a bus around to pick up girls  who want to party with the next Fed chairman
label2 So you can see why it's so important to get in
label2 Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into
label2 Why would you ask me that
label2 None of them
label2 That's the point
label2 The ability to make money doesn't impress anybody around here
label2 Must be nice
label2 He made $300,000 in a summer
label2 He likes meteorology
label2 You said it was oil futures
label2 You can read the weather, you can predict the price of heating oil
label2 You asked me which one was the easiest to get into  because you think that that's the one where I'll have the best chance
label2 The one that's the easiest to get into would be the one  where anybody has the best chance
label2 You didn't ask me which one was the best one,  you asked me which one was the easiest one
label2 I was honestly just asking, okay
label2 I was just asking to ask
label2 Mark, I'm not speaking in code
label2 Erica
label2 You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about it  who will prescribe you some sort of medication
label2 You don't care if the side effects may include blindness
label2 Final clubs
label2 Not "finals clubs.
label2 Yes
label2 There is
label2 That was cryptic, so you do speak in code
label2 I didn't mean to be cryptic
label2 I'm just saying I need to do something substantial  in order to get the attention of the clubs
label2 Because they're exclusive
label2 And fun, and they lead to a better life
label2 Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president  because he was a member of the Phoenix Club
label2 He was a member of the Porcellian, and yes, he did
label2 Well, why don't you just concentrate on being the best you you can be
label2 I was kidding
label2 Just because something's trite doesn't make it less true
label2 I wanna try to be straightforward with you  and tell you I think you might want to be a little more supportive
label2 If I get in, I will be taking you to the events and the gatherings,  and you'll be meeting a lot of people you wouldn't normally get to meet
label2 You would do that for me
label2 Okay
label2 Well, I wanna try and be straightforward with you  and let you know that we're not anymore
label2 What do you mean
label2 We're not dating anymore
label2 I'm sorry
label2 No, it's not
label2 You're breaking up with me
label2 You're gonna introduce me to people  I wouldn't normally have the chance to meet
label2 What the... What is that supposed to mean
label2 Wait, settle down
label2 Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink right now  is 'cause you used to sleep with the door guy
label2 "The door guy"
label2 His name is Bobby
label2 I have not slept with the door guy
label2 Wait
label2 Wait, wait
label2 I'm going back to my dorm
label2 Is this real
label2 Yes
label2 Then wait, I apologize, okay
label2 I have to go study
label2 Erica
label2 I'm sorry, I mean it
label2 I appreciate that, but I have to go study
label2 Come on, you don't have to study
label2 Let's just talk
label2 Why
label2 Because it is exhausting
label2 Dating you is like dating a StairMaster
label2 Currently..
label2 I wasn't making a comment on your appearance
label2 I was saying that you go to BU
label2 I was stating a fact, that's all,  and if it seemed rude, then I apologize
label2 I have to go study
label2 Why do you keep saying I don't have to study
label2 'Cause you go to BU
label2 Do you want to get some food
label2 I am sorry you are not sufficiently impressed with my education
label2 I don't want friends
label2 I was just being polite
label2 I have no intention of being friends with you
label2 I'm under some pressure right now from my OS class  and if we could just order some food, I think we should..
label2 But you're gonna go through life thinking that girls don't like you  because you're a nerd
label2 And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that won't be true
label2 It'll be because you're an asshole
label2 Erica Albright's a bitch
label2 Do you think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht,  or do you think it's because all BU girls are bitches
label2 She's a 34B, as in barely anything there
label2 False advertising
label2 The truth is, she has a nice face
label2 I need to do something to take my mind off her
label2 I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie
label2 So what if it's not even 10:00 p.m. And it's a Tuesday night
label2 Billy
label2 Billy Olson's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of the pictures  next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter
label2 Good call, Mr. Olson
label2 Yeah, it's on
label2 I'm not gonna do the farm animals,  but I like the idea of comparing two people together
label2 It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel  since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit  than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness,  like they do on hotornot
label2 Com
label2 The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures
label2 Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook,  so I'm going to have to get all the images  from the individual houses that people are in
label2 First up is Kirkland
label2 So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook
label2 Kids' stuff
label2 Next is Eliot
label2 They're also open, but with no indexes on Apache
label2 I can run an empty search  and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page
label2 And I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me
label2 Excellent
label2 Excuse me
label2 Everybody
label2 You are at one of the oldest, one of the most exclusive clubs,  not just at Harvard, but in the world
label2 And I want to welcome you all  to Phoenix Club's first party of the fall semester
label2 They require a user name/password combo,  and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't have access to the main FAS user database,  so they have no way of detecting an intrusion
label2 Adams has no security, but limits the number of results to 20 a page
label2 All I need to do is break out the same script I used on Lowell and we're set
label2 Quincy has no online facebook
label2 Nothing I can do about that
label2 Dunster is intense
label2 Not only is there no public directory, but there's no directory at all
label2 And once you do get results, they don't link directly to the images
label2 They link to a PHP that redirects or something
label2 Weird
label2 This may be difficult
label2 Hey, Shark Week's on
label2 What
label2 Great white, beautiful fish
label2 Nice
label2 Leverett is a little better
label2 So it's definitely necessary to break out Emacs and modify that Perl script
label2 Here you go
label2 Done
label2 Hey, what's going on
label2 Perfect timing
label2 Eduardo's here and he's going to have the key ingredient
label2 Hey, Mark
label2 Wardo
label2 How did you know that
label2 It's on your blog
label2 Yeah
label2 I need you
label2 I'm here for you
label2 No, I need the algorithm you use to rank chess players
label2 Are you okay
label2 You mean other students
label2 Yeah
label2 You think this is such a good idea
label2 I need the algorithm
label2 Mark..
label2 Give each girl a base rating of 1400
label2 When any two girls are matched up, there's an expectation of which will win  based on their current rating, right
label2 Yeah
label2 And those expectations are expressed this way
label2 Let's write it
label2 One on the left
label2 The right
label2 Yeah, still the right
label2 Who should we send it to first
label2 Dwyer
label2 Who are you gonna send it to
label2 Just a couple of people
label2 The question is,  who are they gonna send it to
label2 Hey, guys, check this out
label2 Someone go to the left
label2 Dude, do left
label2 Right or left
label2 Left is hot
label2 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
label2 Right or left
label2 That's my roommate
label2 The girl on the left
label2 This is pathetic
label2 Right
label2 Left
label2 Left
label2 Left
label2 Albright
label2 He blogged about you
label2 You don't wanna read it
label2 Left
label2 Latina
label2 Is this yours
label2 I stole it from a tranny
label2 Get the hell out of here
label2 Left
label2 Man, that's an awful lot of traffic
label2 You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down before we get into trouble
label2 Hello
label2 Wait, wait, wait, wait
label2 What
label2 Well, there's a very unusual amount of traffic to the switch at Kirkland
label2 You're saying it's unusual for 4:00 in the morning
label2 No, this'd be unusual for halftime at the Super Bowl
label2 All right
label2 I gotta go in
label2 What's going on
label2 You don't think..
label2 Go see if it's everybody's
label2 I can't connect
label2 The network's down
label2 Unless it's a coincidence, I think this is us
label2 Holy shit
label2 So you were called in front of the Ad Board
label2 That's not what happened
label2 You weren't called in front of the Administrative Board
label2 I mean back at the bar with Erica Albright
label2 She said all that
label2 Mark...  That I said that stuff to her
label2 I was reading from the transcript of her deposition
label2 Yeah, why would you even need to depose her
label2 That's really for us to decide
label2 You think if I know she can make me look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle
label2 Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute
label2 It's been almost three hours
label2 And frankly, you did spend an awful lot of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg  with the girl's testimony from the bar
label2 She was under oath
label2 Then I guess that would be the first time somebody's lied under oath
label2 The site got 2,200 hits within two hours
label2 Thousand
label2 What
label2 Wow
label2 These guys are just freaking fast
label2 Jump out and swim
label2 I think we'd have to jump out and drown
label2 Well, you could row forward and I could row backward
label2 We're genetically identical
label2 Science says we'd stay in one place
label2 Just row the damn boat
label2 What
label2 Two nights ago, a sophomore choked the network from a laptop at Kirkland
label2 At 4:00 a.m.  How
label2 He set up a website where you vote on the hotness of female undergrads
label2 What were we doing that none of us heard about this
label2 I don't know
label2 Full course load
label2 Studying
label2 Another three hours in the tank and then studying
label2 How much activity was there on this thing
label2 Twentytwo thousand page requests
label2 Twentytwo thousand
label2 Cam, this guy hacked the facebook of seven houses
label2 He set up the whole website in one night, and he did it while he was drunk
label2 Well, how do you know he was drunk
label2 He was blogging simultaneously
label2 You know what I think
label2 This is our guy
label2 Cameron Winklevoss
label2 WlNKLEVOSS
label2 "Cameron" spelled the usual way
label2 Tyler spelled the usual way, and my last name is the same as my brother's
label2 Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative Board hearing
label2 You're being accused of intentionally breaching security,  violating copyrights,  violating individual privacy by creating the website www.facemash.com
label2 You're also charged with being in violation of university policy,  on distribution of digitized images
label2 Before we begin with our questioning, you're allowed to make a statement
label2 Would you like to do so
label2 As for any charges stemming from the breach of security,  I believe I deserve some recognition from this board
label2 I'm sorry
label2 Yes
label2 I don't understand
label2 You deserve recognition
label2 I believe I've pointed out some pretty gaping holes in your system
label2 Excuse me, may I
label2 Mr. Zuckerberg,  I'm in charge of security for all computers on the Harvard network,  and I can assure you of its sophistication
label2 In fact, it was that level of sophistication that led us to you in less than four hours
label2 Four hours
label2 Yes, sir
label2 So
label2 Six months academic probation
label2 Wow
label2 They had my blog
label2 I shouldn't have written that thing about the farm animals
label2 That was stupid
label2 But I was kidding, for God's sakes
label2 Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor
label2 I tried to stop you
label2 How do you do this thing where you manage to get all girls to hate us
label2 And why do I let you
label2 I know
label2 You can't do that
label2 Okay, let's look at a sample problem
label2 Suppose we're given a computer with a 16bit virtual address  and a page size of 256 bytes
label2 The system uses onelevel page tables that start at address hex 400
label2 Maybe you want DMA on your 16bit system
label2 The first few pages are reserved for hardware flags, etc
label2 Assume pagetable entries have eight status bits
label2 The eight status bits would then be..
label2 Anybody
label2 And I see we have our first surrender
label2 Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg
label2 One valid bit, one modified bit, one reference bit and five permission bits
label2 That is correct
label2 Does everybody see how he got there
label2 Mark
label2 Cameron Winklevoss
label2 Hi
label2 Tyler Winklevoss
label2 Are you guys related
label2 That's good
label2 Funny
label2 So, what can I do for you
label2 Did I insult your girlfriends
label2 No
label2 Actually, I don't know
label2 Yeah, we never asked
label2 We should do that
label2 No
label2 We have an idea we want to talk to you about
label2 You got a minute
label2 We have to
label2 Why
label2 We row crew
label2 Yeah, I've got a minute
label2 Great
label2 No
label2 I've heard
label2 You want a sandwich or something
label2 Okay
label2 Mark, right
label2 Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner
label2 Hi
label2 We were really impressed with Facemash
label2 I don't know CourseMatch
label2 You go online and see what courses your friends are taking
label2 It's really smart, man
label2 Mark
label2 Yeah
label2 It was kind of a nobrainer
label2 But you invented something in high school, too, right
label2 An app for an MP3 player that recognizes your taste in music
label2 Anybody try to buy it
label2 Microsoft
label2 Wow
label2 How much
label2 Uploaded it for free
label2 For free
label2 Yeah
label2 Why
label2 It's called the Harvard Connection
label2 You create your own page
label2 Interests, bio, friends, pics
label2 And then people can go online, see your bio, request to be your...  Yeah, how is that different from MySpace or Friendster
label2 Edu
label2 Harvard
label2 I mean, the whole site's kind of based on the idea that girls...  Not to put anything indelicately, but..
label2 Girls wanna go with guys who go to Harvard
label2 The main difference between what we're talking about and MySpace or Friendster,  or any of those other social networking sites is...  Is exclusivity
label2 Right
label2 Right
label2 Yeah
label2 We'd love for you to work with us, Mark
label2 And we know that you've been taking it in the shins
label2 Women's groups are ready to declare a fatwa
label2 But, you know, this could help rehabilitate your image
label2 Wow
label2 You would do that for me
label2 We'd like to work with you
label2 Our second programmer just got overwhelmed with schoolwork
label2 We would need you to build the site and write the code, and we'll provide all the..
label2 I'm in
label2 What
label2 Awesome
label2 That's what you said
label2 It was three or four years ago
label2 I don't know what I said
label2 I don't understand that question
label2 The affirmative
label2 When did you come to Eduardo with the idea for Facebook
label2 It was called The Facebook then
label2 This doesn't need to be that difficult
label2 I'm currently in the middle of two different lawsuits
label2 Did you say yes
label2 I said I'd help
label2 When did you approach Mr. Saverin with the idea for The Facebook
label2 I wouldn't say I approached him
label2 Sy
label2 You can answer the question
label2 What's that
label2 The Jewish fraternity
label2 It was Caribbean Night
label2 It's not that guys like me are generally attracted to Asian girls
label2 It's that Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me
label2 I don't think it's that complicated
label2 They're hot, they're smart,  they're not Jewish, and they can't dance
label2 Mark
label2 Be right back
label2 I think I've come up with something
label2 Hang on
label2 What
label2 I got punched by the Phoenix
label2 Are you kidding
label2 I mean, it's just the first of a fourstep process,  but they slid the invitation under my door tonight
label2 I go to my first punch party tomorrow
label2 So...  You got punched by the Phoenix
label2 Yeah, but, you know, it was probably just a diversity thing
label2 Just ride that horse until...  What did you wanna talk to me about
label2 Mark
label2 Yeah
label2 Yeah, I think I've come up with something
label2 Come outside and let's talk
label2 It's 20 degrees outside
label2 I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,  which has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean
label2 People came to Facemash in a stampede, right
label2 Yeah
label2 You can go anywhere on the Internet and see pictures of hot girls
label2 Yeah
label2 People want to go on the Internet and check out their friends,  so why not build a website that offers that
label2 Friends, pictures, profiles, whatever you can visit
label2 Browse around
label2 Maybe it's someone you just met at a party
label2 But I'm not talking about a dating site
label2 I'm talking about taking the entire social experience of college and putting it online
label2 I can't feel my legs
label2 I know
label2 But, Wardo
label2 Yeah
label2 "It would be exclusive.
label2 You would have to know the people on the site to get past your own page
label2 Now, that's good
label2 Wardo, it's like a final club, except we're the president
label2 I told him I thought it sounded great
label2 It was a great idea
label2 And people had the ability to invite, or not invite, their friends to join
label2 See, in a world where social structure was everything,  that was the thing
label2 It was a big project,  and he was going to have to write tens of thousands of lines of code,  so I wondered why he was coming to me and not his roommates,  Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes
label2 They were programmers
label2 We're gonna need a little startup cash to rent the servers and get it online
label2 So that was why
label2 Yes
label2 We'll split it, 70/30
label2 70 for me, 30 for you for putting up the $1,000  and for handling everything on the business end
label2 You're CFO
label2 And you said
label2 Okay
label2 Yes
label2 It probably was a diversity thing
label2 But so what
label2 Why do you think he said that
label2 Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting, but whose discovery is this
label2 What are you suggesting
label2 That I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched by the Phoenix  and began a plan to screw him out of a company   I hadn't even invented yet
label2 Were you
label2 Gretchen
label2 Jealous of Eduardo
label2 Stop typing
label2 Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,  and so you know that money isn't a big part of my life
label2 But at the moment, I could buy Mount Auburn Street,  take the Phoenix Club and turn it into my pingpong room
label2 I'll let you know how the party is
label2 We recognize that you're a plaintiff in one suit involving Facebook,  and a witness in another
label2 At any time in the weeks prior to Mark's telling you his idea,  did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss,  Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection
label2 Yes
label2 He said they'd asked him to work on their site,  but that he looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time
label2 He said even his most pathetic friends  knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys
label2 "These guys," meaning my clients
label2 But Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything
label2 With Facemash, he'd hacked into the Harvard computers,  he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board, he'd gotten a lot of notoriety
label2 Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to do
label2 Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building The Facebook,  he was also communicating with the plaintiffs
label2 Not at the time, I wasn't
label2 It really didn't have much to do with the Winklevosses' dating site
label2 How would you know
label2 You weren't even there
label2 Ty
label2 You're offering a conclusion not found in evidence
label2 We are about to find it in evidence
label2 From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss
label2 November 30th, 2003
label2 "And it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement
label2 "So we can talk about it after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night.
label2 From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron Winklevoss
label2 December 1 st, 2003
label2 I just got about three of your missed calls
label2 "I was working on a problem set for my systems class.
label2 From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
label2 December 10, 2003
label2 "This week has been pretty busy thus far with classes and work,  "so I think it's probably best to postpone the meeting.
label2 "I'm also really busy tomorrow.
label2 Tell him okay,  but we do have to make sure that we meet up before we all go off for break
label2 Yeah, watch out
label2 Hey, Mark
label2 I need a dedicated Linux box running Apache with a MySQL back end
label2 It's gonna cost a little more money
label2 How much more
label2 Do we need it
label2 Gotta handle the traffic
label2 Do it
label2 Hey, guess what
label2 I made the second cut
label2 That's good
label2 You should be proud of that right there
label2 Don't worry if you don't make it any further
label2 I'll get out of here
label2 From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss  and Divya Narendra
label2 December 15th, 2003
label2 "I won't really be free to meet until next Wednesday afternoon.
label2 "I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon
label2 "I've basically been in the lab this whole time, and also I..."  "...won't be able to do Saturday, as I have to meet up with my parents.
label2 As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard, founder of Harvard University in 1638
label2 What are the three lies
label2 Mr. Dowd
label2 The three lies
label2 Take your pants off
label2 Mr. Saverin
label2 One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638
label2 Two, Harvard was not founded by John Harvard
label2 And three, that is not John Harvard
label2 It's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester
label2 Keep your jacket on
label2 Thirtynine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's initial meeting with my clients,  and he still hadn't completed work on Harvard Connection
label2 But on January 11th, 2004,  Mr. Zuckerberg registered the domain name The Facebook  via Network Solutions
label2 To the best of your knowledge, had he even begun work on Harvard Connection
label2 Not to my knowledge
label2 No
label2 "Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site  "to really draw the attention and gain the critical mass necessary  "to get a site like this to run"
label2 "We'll speak soon"
label2 This is the first time he mentioned any problem
label2 You sent 36 emails to Mr. Zuckerberg and received 16 emails in return,  and this was the first time he indicated he was not happy
label2 That's correct
label2 He had 42 days to study our system and get out ahead
label2 Do you see any of your code on Facebook
label2 Sy, could you...  Did I use any of your code
label2 Fellas
label2 Match.com for Harvard guys
label2 Can I continue with my deposition
label2 You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this
label2 If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,  you'd have invented Facebook
label2 I can't wait to stand over your shoulder and watch you write us a check
label2 No shit
label2 February 4, 2004
label2 Mark
label2 There is a girl in your art history class
label2 Her name is Stephanie Attis
label2 Do you happen to know if she has a boyfriend
label2 And, if not, do you happen to know if she's looking to go out with anyone
label2 Dustin
label2 We were supposed to meet at 9:00
label2 Have you slept yet
label2 I have to add something
label2 What
label2 That looks really good
label2 It's clean and simple
label2 No Disneyland, no "live nude girls.
label2 But watch
label2 What'd you write
label2 "Relationship Status.
label2 "Interested In.
label2 "Are you having sex or aren't you?
label2 And at its center, you know, that's what The Facebook is gonna be about
label2 People are gonna log on because after all the cake and watermelon,  there's a chance they're actually gonna...   Gonna get laid
label2 ...meet a girl
label2 Yes
label2 That is really good
label2 And that was it
label2 It's ready
label2 It's ready
label2 Yeah
label2 That was it
label2 And here's the masthead
label2 You made a masthead
label2 Yeah
label2 "Eduardo Saverin, cofounder and CFO.
label2 Yeah
label2 Sure I do
label2 So when's it going live
label2 Right now
label2 Get your laptop out
label2 Why do we need my laptop
label2 Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool with them that I spam their emails
label2 This is not spam
label2 No, I know it's not spam
label2 I haven't gotten in yet
label2 These guys know people
label2 And I need their emails
label2 Sure
label2 Good
label2 Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu
label2 These guys
label2 Yeah, they're literary geniuses  because the world's most obvious Lewis Carroll reference is in..
label2 I'm just saying
label2 Yeah, you're right
label2 The site's live
label2 You know, let's go get a drink and celebrate
label2 Mark
label2 Mark, are you praying
label2 Whatever happened to Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
label2 It's a Valentine's Day theme
label2 They're playing love songs
label2 Good point
label2 'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin never wrote any love songs
label2 Honey, you should put your laptop away
label2 KC
label2 What is it
label2 I don't know
label2 No, it's not
label2 Div
label2 What
label2 This isn't mine
label2 Okay, what is wrong
label2 It's fine
label2 It's fine
label2 Hey
label2 Not now
label2 Okay
label2 I just wanted to let you know that Zuckerberg stole our website
label2 Mark Zuckerberg
label2 It's been live for more than 36 hours
label2 Mr. Hotchkiss
label2 Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad
label2 "Welcome to The Facebook
label2 "The Facebook is an online directory that connects people  "through different social networks
label2 "You must have a harvard
label2 Edu address to register.
label2 Yeah, I called earlier
label2 I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg
label2 He's actually quoted a couple times
label2 "'Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal facebook within Harvard,' he says.
label2 "He" meaning Mark
label2 "'I think it's kind of silly that it would take the university  "'a couple of years to get around to it
label2 "'I can do a classier job than they can and I did it in a week."
label2 I know, that's how he talks
label2 Appreciate it
label2 "As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,  "over 650 students had registered to use thefacebook
label2 Com
label2 "He said he anticipated that 900 students would have joined the site by this morning.
label2 God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't give free drugs to 650 people in one day
label2 And this guy doesn't have three friends to rub together to make a fourth
label2 Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss
label2 We'll put all this together and we'll email it to you
label2 Well, you won't be able to go on the website yourself
label2 Because you don't have a Harvard...  You know what, it would just be easier for us to email it to you
label2 He's a good guy and he's very bright and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...  Wow
label2 ...what he did
label2 All right, thank you very much
label2 And, Dad...  All right, love you, too
label2 We don't know that he's not a good guy
label2 We know he stole our idea
label2 We know he lied to our faces for a month and a half
label2 No, he never lied to our faces
label2 Fine, he lied to our email accounts and he gave himself a 42day head start,  because he knows what apparently you don't,  which is that getting there first is everything
label2 I'm a competitive racer, Div
label2 I don't think you need to school me in the importance of getting there first
label2 Thank you
label2 That was your father's lawyer
label2 It was his inhouse counsel
label2 What's that gonna do
label2 What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer and sue him
label2 No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat the shit out of him with a hammer
label2 We don't even have to do that
label2 We could do that ourselves
label2 I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me
label2 I'm with this guy
label2 Well, whatever
label2 I'm saying, let's calm down until we know what we're talking about
label2 We met with Mark three times, we exchanged 52 emails,  we can prove that he looked at the code
label2 What is that on the bottom of the page
label2 It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production.
label2 On every page
label2 Shit, I need a second to let the classiness waft over me
label2 Okay, look, we don't know...  Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said he hoped the privacy options  "would help restore his reputation  "following student outrage over facemash
label2 Com.
label2 That's exactly what we said to him
label2 While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer to look this stuff over,  we can at least get something going in the paper so people know...   What
label2 ...that this is in dispute
label2 And we're not suing anybody
label2 Why not
label2 I don't understand, I don't understand
label2 Why not
label2 What, who, me
label2 Say it
label2 Why not
label2 Because we're gentlemen of Harvard
label2 You thought he was gonna be the only one who thought that was stupid
label2 During the time when you say you had this idea,  did you know Tyler and Cameron came from a family of means
label2 "A family of means"
label2 Did you know their father was wealthy
label2 I'm not sure why you're asking me that
label2 It's not important you be sure why I'm asking
label2 It's not important to you
label2 Did you know that they came from money
label2 I had no idea whether they came from money or not
label2 In one of your emails to Mr. Narendra,  you referenced Howard Winklevoss' consulting firm
label2 Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose assets are in the hundreds of millions
label2 You also knew Tyler and Cameron were members  of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian
label2 They pointed that out
label2 Excuse us for inviting you in
label2 To the bike room
label2 Yes
label2 Let me tell you why I'm asking
label2 I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000 for an Internet venture,  you didn't ask my clients for it
label2 They had demonstrated an interest to you in that kind of thing
label2 I went to my friend for the money because that's who I wanted to be partners with
label2 Eduardo was the president of the Harvard Investors Association,  and he was also my best friend
label2 Your best friend is suing you for $600 million
label2 Tell me more
label2 I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind addressing him as Mr. Saverin
label2 Gretchen, they're best friends
label2 Not anymore
label2 Well, we already went through this on the... Never mind
label2 Mr. Saverin, what happened after the initial launch
label2 It exploded
label2 "Facebook me" was a common expression after two weeks
label2 And Mark
label2 And Mark was the biggest thing on a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,  15 Pulitzer Prize winners, two future Olympians, and a movie star
label2 Who was the movie star
label2 Does it matter
label2 No
label2 It was a beautiful day and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room
label2 He brought that magazine up and he showed it to me and he said,  "Look, it's gonna happen without us
label2 And I said, "Okay
label2 Let's get BASIC out there.
label2 The beginnings of this industry were very humble
label2 That kit computer on the cover of that magazine had an 8080 processor in it
label2 Unless you paid extra for a 1 K memory board, you got 256 bytes
label2 So the challenge when I wrote BASIC wasn't just to run at 4 kbytes,  but I also had to leave room for the users to run their programs in 4 kbytes
label2 Your friend
label2 Is that Mark Zuckerberg
label2 Yeah
label2 He made The Facebook
label2 I mean, it's both of ours
label2 Yes
label2 Cool
label2 I'm Christy Ling
label2 This is Alice
label2 Hi
label2 Facebook me when you get home
label2 You know, maybe we can all go out and grab a drink
label2 Certainly
label2 Absolutely do that
label2 She said, "Facebook me and we can all go for a drink later,"  which is stunningly great for two reasons
label2 One, she said "facebook me," right
label2 They wanna have drinks later
label2 Excuse me, Mark
label2 Yeah
label2 I'm Stuart Singer
label2 I'm in your OS lab
label2 Sure
label2 Awesome job with The Facebook
label2 Thanks
label2 I'm Bob
label2 How you doing
label2 You know, I could swear he was looking at you  when he said the next Bill Gates could be right in this room
label2 I doubt it
label2 I don't even know who the speaker was
label2 Shit, that makes sense
label2 All right
label2 Thanks, guys
label2 Are you a moron
label2 Are you medically stupid
label2 You can't tell Bill Gates is in front of you for an hour
label2 Can I get a Glock and kill you
label2 It's time to monetize the thing
label2 What were their names
label2 When
label2 I said it's time to monetize the site
label2 It means it's time for the website to start generating revenue
label2 No, I know what the word means
label2 I'm asking how you wanna do it
label2 Advertising
label2 No
label2 Well, we got 4,000 members
label2 'Cause The Facebook is cool,  and if we start installing popups for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool
label2 We don't know what it is
label2 We don't know what it can be
label2 We don't know what it will be
label2 We know that it is cool
label2 So when will it be finished
label2 It won't be finished
label2 That's the point
label2 The way fashion's never finished
label2 What
label2 You're talking about fashion
label2 Really, you
label2 I'm talking about the idea of it and I'm saying that it's never finished
label2 Okay
label2 But they manage to make money selling pants
label2 Mark, what is this
label2 What
label2 This
label2 Who
label2 The girls
label2 When did you get this
label2 About 10 days ago
label2 Right after we launched the site
label2 Hey, the girls
label2 What were their names
label2 The Winklevoss twins are saying that you stole their idea
label2 I find that to be a little more than mildly annoying
label2 Oh, well, they find it to be intellectual property theft
label2 Look...  Why didn't you show this to me
label2 They're saying that we stole The Facebook from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses
label2 I know what it says
label2 Did we
label2 Did we what
label2 Look at me
label2 The letter says we could face legal action
label2 No, it says I could face legal action
label2 This is from a lawyer, Mark
label2 The lawyer is their father's house counsel
label2 Do they have grounds
label2 Wardo, I didn't use any of their code, I promise
label2 I didn't use anything
label2 Look, a guy who builds a nice chair doesn't owe money  to everyone who ever has built a chair, okay
label2 They came to me with an idea, I had a better one
label2 I didn't think it was a big deal
label2 Okay
label2 So if there's something wrong, if there's ever anything wrong, you can tell me
label2 I'm the guy that wants to help
label2 This is our thing
label2 Now, is there anything that you need to tell me
label2 No
label2 And what did you say
label2 "When we met in January, I expressed my doubts about the site
label2 "Where it stood with graphics, how much programing was left  "that I had not anticipated.
label2 "The lack of hardware we had to deal with site use,  "the lack of promotion that would go on to successfully launch the website.
label2 I'd raised concerns before
label2 Bullshit
label2 Not to us
label2 Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting in January to which this letter is referring
label2 Let me rephrase this
label2 You sent my client 16 emails
label2 In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns
label2 Is that a question
label2 In the 16th email you raised concerns about the site's functionality
label2 Were you leading them on for six weeks
label2 No
label2 Then why didn't you raise any of these concerns before
label2 I'm sorry
label2 It just started raining
label2 No
label2 Do you think I deserve it
label2 What
label2 I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition  and I don't wanna perjure myself, so I have a legal obligation to say no
label2 Okay
label2 No
label2 You don't think I deserve your attention
label2 You have part of my attention
label2 You have the minimum amount
label2 The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook,  where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room,  including and especially your clients,  are intellectually or creatively capable of doing
label2 Well, I have 12:45
label2 Why don't we say that's lunch
label2 Back at 2:30
label2 So what were their names
label2 Their names were Christy and Alice,  and they wanna have drinks tonight
label2 You're not supposed to be in here
label2 This is a men's room
label2 Wow
label2 I don't care
label2 Hey, man, sorry
label2 Sweet
label2 We have groupies
label2 I'll be right back
label2 Mark, where you going
label2 Mark
label2 Erica
label2 I saw you from over there
label2 I didn't know you came to this club a lot
label2 First time
label2 Could I talk to you alone for a second
label2 I think I'm good right here
label2 I'd love to talk to you alone if we could just go someplace
label2 Right here is fine
label2 I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched
label2 No
label2 You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark
label2 That's why I wanted to talk to you
label2 On the Internet
label2 Comparing women to farm animals
label2 I didn't end up doing that
label2 It didn't stop you from writing it
label2 As if every thought that tumbles through your head was so clever  it would be a crime for it not to be shared
label2 The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink,  and you published that Erica Albright was a bitch,  right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, my bra size,  and then rated women based on their hotness
label2 Erica, is there a problem
label2 You write your snide bullshit from a dark room  because that's what the angry do nowadays
label2 I was nice to you
label2 Don't torture me for it
label2 If we could just go somewhere for a minute..
label2 Okay
label2 Good luck with your video game
label2 Hey, that was great
label2 That was the right thing to do
label2 We have to expand
label2 Sure
label2 Mark
label2 Is he mad about something
label2 Okay, we are expanding to Yale and Columbia
label2 Chris, you're gonna be in charge of publicity and outreach,  and you could start by getting a story in the BU student newspaper
label2 It's The Bridge
label2 They hate doing stories about Harvard
label2 Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free programing
label2 Why do you want a story in the BU newspaper
label2 Because I do
label2 Eduardo is CFO and owns 30% of the company
label2 Dustin is vice president and head of programing,  and his 5% of the company will come from my end
label2 Chris is director of publicity,  and his compensation will depend on how much work he ends up doing
label2 Who are the girls
label2 Sorry
label2 They're Christy and Alice
label2 Hi
label2 Hi
label2 Hi
label2 Is there anything we can do
label2 No, that's it
label2 Yale and Columbia, let's go
label2 What
label2 Stanford
label2 It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto
label2 You don't want any lunch
label2 You're welcome to some salad
label2 No, thank you
label2 This must be hard
label2 Who are you
label2 I introduced myself when we first..
label2 I mean, what do you do
label2 I'm a secondyear associate at the firm
label2 My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase
label2 What are you doing
label2 Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia
label2 They don't have roads, but they have Facebook
label2 You must really hate the Winklevosses
label2 The Winklevi aren't suing me for intellectual property theft
label2 They are suing me because for the first time in their lives,  things didn't work out the way they were supposed to for them
label2 He's expanding
label2 He's expanding to Yale, Columbia and Stanford
label2 It's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow
label2 Really
label2 Yep
label2 I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief and get the site taken down now
label2 Every minute the site is up, Harvard Connection becomes less valuable
label2 I want an injunction
label2 I want damages
label2 And I want him dead
label2 Yeah, I want those things, too
label2 Then why aren't we doing anything about it
label2 Because we're gentlemen of Harvard
label2 No, it's because you're not thinking how it's gonna look
label2 How's it gonna look
label2 Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law
label2 When he goes to Connecticut, New York and California,  he'll have violated federal law
label2 And, by the way, he's in violation of Harvard law
label2 There's no such thing as Harvard law
label2 Wait
label2 Yeah, there is
label2 Every freshman is issued one of these, and somewhere in this book it says...  You can't steal from another student
label2 We're going to Summers
label2 Well, you can't get a meeting with Larry Summers
label2 My brother and I, we pay tuition at this school
label2 We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school
label2 We've won trophies for this school
label2 And we'll be rowing in the Olympics for this school
label2 I want a meeting with the goddamn president of this school
label2 Why do you think
label2 I'm sorry
label2 Okay
label2 You don't know my name, do you
label2 Is it Stanford
label2 How do you go to a party and you meet someone...  Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy
label2 You're from Orinda
label2 Your father's in commercial real estate and your mother's 10 years sober
label2 Trombone
label2 Really
label2 I remember something about a trombone
label2 French
label2 Your major's French
label2 Mine
label2 I don't have one
label2 You haven't declared
label2 I don't go to school
label2 You're kidding
label2 No
label2 Well, where did you go to school
label2 Seriously
label2 You're not like 15 years old or anything, are you
label2 No
label2 Wait, you're not like 15, are you
label2 I'm an entrepreneur
label2 You're unemployed
label2 I wouldn't say that
label2 What would you say
label2 That I'm an entrepreneur
label2 Well, then, what was your latest preneur
label2 Well, I founded an Internet company that let folks download and share music for free
label2 Exactly like Napster
label2 I founded Napster
label2 Sean Parker founded Napster
label2 Nice to meet you
label2 You're Sean Parker
label2 You see, the shoe's on the other..
label2 Foot
label2 Table, which has turned
label2 You just slept on Sean Parker
label2 You're a zillionaire
label2 Not technically
label2 What are you
label2 There's not a lot of money in free music,  even less when you're being sued by everyone who's ever been to the Grammys
label2 This is blowing my mind
label2 I gotta hop in the shower and get ready for class
label2 Biochem, even though you're a French major whose name is Amy
label2 You passed
label2 I'm a hard worker
label2 There's juice or anything else you can find
label2 Help yourself
label2 You mind if I check my email
label2 Amy
label2 Amy
label2 Can you come out here
label2 Yeah
label2 Just a second
label2 There's a snake in here, Amy
label2 What
label2 Where
label2 Are you kidding me
label2 How
label2 By running too fast and getting twisted in the curtain
label2 What do you need to ask me
label2 Yeah, I went to check my email and there's a website open on your computer
label2 Yeah, after you passed out last night I went on The Facebook for a little bit
label2 The Facebook
label2 Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now
label2 It's really awesome, except it's freakishly addictive
label2 Mind if I send myself an email
label2 Yeah, is everything okay
label2 Everything's great
label2 I've never been in this building before
label2 This building's 100 years older than the country it's in, so do be careful
label2 We're sitting in chairs
label2 Yes
label2 Very good
label2 You can go in now
label2 That's their own stupidity
label2 I should've been there
label2 Catherine, I've got students in my office now
label2 Students
label2 Undergrads
label2 From the looks of it, they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise
label2 All right, byebye
label2 Good morning
label2 Good morning, sir
label2 I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler
label2 Either of you can answer
label2 I'm sorry, sir, I thought you were reading the letter
label2 Well, we came up with an idea for a website called Harvard Connection...  We've since changed the name to ConnectU
label2 And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea..
label2 I understand
label2 And I'm asking what you want me to do about it
label2 Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman,  under the heading "Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community,"  it says the college expects all students to be honest and forthcoming  in their dealings with members in this community
label2 Yes, sir
label2 Punch me in the face
label2 Go ahead
label2 ...or unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action,  including the requirement to withdraw from the college
label2 And you memorized that instead of doing what
label2 And you've spoken to your House Master
label2 Yes, sir
label2 And the House Master made a recommendation to the Ad Board,  but the Ad Board won't see us
label2 Have you tried dealing with the other student directly
label2 He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland,  and the closest I've come to dealing with him facetoface  is when I saw him on the quad and chased him through Harvard Square
label2 You chased him
label2 I saw him and I know he saw me
label2 I don't see this as a university issue
label2 Of course this is a university issue
label2 There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both
label2 You enter into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other
label2 I'm devastated by that
label2 What my brother means is, if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room  and stole our computer, that would be a university issue
label2 This office doesn't handle petty larceny
label2 This isn't petty larceny
label2 This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars
label2 Millions
label2 Yes
label2 You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you
label2 Sir, I honestly don't think you're in any position to make that call
label2 I'm in some position to make that call
label2 Well, then I would suggest that you let your imaginations  run away with you on a new project
label2 You would
label2 Yes
label2 Everyone at Harvard's inventing something
label2 Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job
label2 So I'll suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project
label2 I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point
label2 You don't have to be an intellectual property expert  to understand the difference between right and wrong
label2 And you're saying that I don't
label2 Of course I'm not saying that, sir
label2 Really
label2 Sir
label2 Anne, how did they get this appointment
label2 Let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,  since you're on the subject of right and wrong
label2 This action, this meeting, the two of you being here is wrong
label2 It's not what Harvard saw in you
label2 You don't get special treatment
label2 We never asked...  Just start another project
label2 Like we're making a diorama for a science fair
label2 If you have a problem with that, Mr. Winklevoss...  We never asked for special treatment
label2 ...the courts are always at your disposal
label2 Is there anything else I can do for you
label2 Thank you very much for your time, sir
label2 Broke your 335yearold doorknob
label2 Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York
label2 Yes
label2 What was the purpose of the trip
label2 Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings with potential advertisers
label2 Who paid for the trip
label2 It was paid for out of the $1,000 account I had set up a few months earlier
label2 At this point, your $1,000 was the only money that had been put into the company
label2 How did you feel the meetings went
label2 Why
label2 Mark was asleep
label2 I was not asleep
label2 Can I rephrase my answer
label2 I wish he'd been asleep
label2 So we're in 29 schools now, with over 75,000 members
label2 People who go on The Facebook  tend to stay on longer than almost any other website
label2 91% of people who try it once will come back
label2 Now, if you'll allow me..
label2 Excuse me one second
label2 What sound is he making
label2 It wasn't a tsk
label2 It was...  Like a glottal stop
label2 Almost a gag reflex
label2 There was one more meeting scheduled for the New York trip
label2 Yes, it was a dinner
label2 It was set up through my girlfriend at the time
label2 Would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting
label2 Very
label2 Look, they're not gonna card us
label2 They might
label2 I mean, look around
label2 Tell him they're not gonna card us
label2 Mark...  Are you gonna talk about ads again
label2 Unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford,  the purpose of a business is to make a profit
label2 It isn't a business yet
label2 That's tough for me, 'cause my... Never mind
label2 He's 25 minutes late
label2 He founded Napster when he was 19
label2 He can be late
label2 He's not a god
label2 He's 25 minutes late
label2 I think Wardo's jealous
label2 I was nervous
label2 Why
label2 Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had done a search and I'd asked around
label2 And he struck me as kind of a...  A wild card
label2 Why
label2 He crashed out of two pretty big Internet companies in spectacular fashion,  he's had a reputation with drugs..
label2 We don't need him
label2 He's here
label2 No, no, take your time
label2 Stop it
label2 I'm Sean Parker
label2 How do you do
label2 You must be Eduardo
label2 And Christy
label2 Great to meet you
label2 You guys don't have anything in front of you
label2 No
label2 Tori
label2 We were waiting
label2 Can you bring out some things
label2 The lacquered pork with that ginger confit
label2 Tuna tartare
label2 And the lobster claws, that'll get us started
label2 Christy, what do you like to drink
label2 Great
label2 Four of those
label2 From that point on, it was a Seanathon
label2 The question was, "What did you talk about?
label2 He took us through his episode with Napster
label2 Who knew
label2 The music industry doesn't have a sense of humor
label2 We tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties,  but I guess to them that was a little like selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas
label2 So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy
label2 And you are dry
label2 Tori
label2 No, no, I'm good
label2 And then he went on to his second business venture,  which was an online Rolodex that he got thrown out of by Case Equity
label2 I put on a tie and I shined my shoes, but nobody wants to take orders from a kid
label2 So let me tell you what happens to a 20yearold at the top of a hot dotcom
label2 I'm not a psychiatrist, but..
label2 You're not a psychiatrist, but what
label2 A psychiatrist would say that he was paranoid
label2 They'll hire private detectives who'll follow you day and night
label2 I can't prove it, but I know they tap my phones
label2 Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up, you've done already
label2 Private behavior is a relic of a time gone by
label2 And if somehow, someway, you've managed to live your life like the Dalai Lama,  they'll make shit up
label2 Because they don't want you, they want your idea
label2 And they want you to say "thank you" while you..
label2 ...wipe your chin and walk away
label2 That's what happened to you
label2 And delusional
label2 Yes
label2 I brought down the record companies with Napster  and Case'll suffer for their sins, too
label2 Sorry, you didn't bring down the record companies
label2 They won
label2 In court
label2 Yeah
label2 And he told story after story about life in Silicon Valley,  and parties at Stanford and down in LA, and friends who'd become millionaires..
label2 He had to come to California
label2 And then he got around to The Facebook
label2 So, tell me about your progress
label2 Well, we're in 29 schools now
label2 We got over 75,000 members
label2 Okay
label2 For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,  but Baylor already had a social network on campus
label2 So instead of going right after them,  we made a list of every school within 100 miles...  You put The Facebook on those campuses first
label2 Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw their friends on our site and we were in
label2 It's called the Little Bighorn
label2 That's smart, Mark
label2 Easy
label2 Hey, you know what
label2 Settle an argument for us
label2 I say it's time to start making money from The Facebook,  but Mark doesn't want advertising
label2 Well..
label2 The Facebook is cool, that's what it's got going for it
label2 Yeah
label2 You don't wanna ruin it with ads because ads aren't cool
label2 Exactly
label2 It's like you're throwing the greatest party on campus  and someone's saying it's gotta be over by 11:00
label2 That's exactly right
label2 Exactly
label2 How big it can get, how far it can go
label2 This is no time to take your chips down
label2 You know what's cool
label2 You
label2 "A billion dollars.
label2 And that shut everybody up
label2 A billiondollar valuation
label2 Unless you take bad advice, in which case you may as well have come up with  a chain of very successful yogurt shops
label2 When you go fishing, you can catch a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish
label2 You ever walk into a guy's den and see a picture of him standing next to 14 trout
label2 No, he's holding a 3,000pound marlin
label2 That's a good analogy
label2 But we all know marlins don't really weigh 3,000 pounds, right
label2 Have you seen the big ones up close
label2 No, but I don't think the guy's holding a marlin the size of a Range Rover
label2 That would be a really big fish and a very strong guy
label2 You think we might be getting away from the point
label2 I'm just a fan who came to say hi
label2 He owned Mark after that dinner
label2 He picked up the check, he told Mark they'd talk again soon,  and he was gone
label2 But not before he made his biggest contribution to the company
label2 Just "Facebook.
label2 It's cleaner
label2 Shit
label2 Yeah
label2 That's gotta be some kind of land speed record for talking
label2 You wanna end the party at 11:00
label2 I'm trying to pay for the party
label2 There won't be a party unless it's cool
label2 Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The.
label2 I meant to catching the marlin instead of the 14 trout
label2 Doesn't that sound good
label2 If you're a trout
label2 Incorporation papers for Facebook, an LLC registered in Florida
label2 Why Florida
label2 It's where my family lives
label2 Yeah, we stipulate
label2 And that was April 13th, 2004
label2 You can mark it
label2 You have anything here
label2 Yes
label2 Thank you
label2 Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything  that might be considered legitimate grounds for termination
label2 No
label2 No
label2 No
label2 You were accused of animal cruelty
label2 Wait
label2 You weren't
label2 This is not happening
label2 I can't have this, Wardo
label2 Come on, man
label2 This is bullshit
label2 I'd gotten into the Phoenix
label2 I'd been accepted, and as part of my initiation I had to,  for one week, carry with me at all times and take care of a chicken
label2 They identify you as one of the founders of Facebook
label2 "Junior Eduardo Saverin..."  I'm not the expert, but being connected to torturing animals  is probably bad for business
label2 I did not torture the chicken
label2 Are you crazy
label2 No, and settle down, please
label2 I have here an article from The Crimson..
label2 This is scathing
label2 956
label2 This was college
label2 Somebody's gonna have to answer for this
label2 969
label2 And the dining hall was serving chicken for dinner,  and I had to feed my chicken, so I...  Well, I took little pieces of chicken and I gave it to the chicken
label2 Someone must have seen me, because the next thing I knew  I was being accused of forced cannibalism
label2 I dealt with the various animal rights groups,  I dealt with the associate dean of the college
label2 988
label2 Someone from the Porc or the Fly must have reported it
label2 For all I know, it was the Winklevosses
label2 All right, let's just forget about it
label2 This is absurd
label2 I'm being accused of animal cruelty
label2 It is better to be accused of necrophilia
label2 I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody
label2 What is happening on that
label2 I have my final coming up for Postwar and Contemporary Art  and I haven't been to class
label2 I'm supposed to write about these four paintings
label2 Yeah
label2 I opened it under an alias
label2 I posted the paintings and asked people to comment
label2 Every once in a while, I hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going
label2 Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating on his final exam
label2 And why not
label2 Because I'm not suing him for cheating on his final exam
label2 That's not what friends do
label2 Well, you just told us he was cheating
label2 Oops
label2 You told your lawyers I was torturing animals
label2 No, he didn't tell us about it at all
label2 In fact, when we raised the subject with him, he defended you
label2 Oops
label2 993
label2 Yeah, that reminds me, we're gonna need more money, Wardo
label2 More servers, more help
label2 I'm interviewing two interns to come to Palo Alto  and we're gonna have to pay them something
label2 Sorry, what
label2 I already found a house for rent  on a street two blocks from the Stanford campus
label2 It is perfect and it's got a pool
label2 When did you decide to go to California for the summer
label2 You mean when did I actually decide
label2 He was right, California's the place we've gotta be
label2 What, you're Jed Clampett
label2 Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius
label2 What is your problem with Sean
label2 He doesn't bring anything to the table
label2 He doesn't have money
label2 He's got connections to VCs
label2 We don't need VCs, we need advertisers
label2 And I have connections to VCs
label2 And as somebody who's just really embarrassed the company in a bad way..
label2 It was the Winklevosses, Mark
label2 Hang on
label2 Hit "Refresh.
label2 150,004
label2 150,000 members, Wardo
label2 Congratulations
label2 You don't think it was strange that he was followed by private detectives
label2 Who came up with nothing
label2 Enough to get him out of the company
label2 The drugs, the girls
label2 You can read about it
label2 I can read about you torturing birds
label2 Since when..
label2 The marlins and the trout
label2 What's he talking about
label2 I'm interviewing interns at 10:00 tomorrow night in the CS lab
label2 You know, I don't really know what else to say
label2 You can do one more
label2 One more
label2 Wardo
label2 Yo
label2 Mark
label2 What's going on
label2 Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator
label2 But here's the beauty
label2 You know I didn't understand anything you just said, right
label2 I do know that
label2 So what's the beauty
label2 Every tenth line of code written, they have to drink a shot
label2 Hacking's supposed to be stealth, so every time the server detects an intrusion,  the candidate responsible has to drink a shot
label2 The last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot
label2 Plus, every three minutes they all have to drink a shot
label2 Three minutes
label2 Drink one now
label2 Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job will they need to be able to do drunk
label2 A more relevant test might be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week
label2 That was mean
label2 What is this
label2 I opened a new account and put $18,000 in it
label2 Will that get you through the summer
label2 Here
label2 Mark
label2 Right here
label2 $18,000
label2 Yes
label2 In addition to the $1,000 you'd already put up
label2 A total of $19,000 now
label2 Yes
label2 I'm just checking your math on that
label2 Yes, I got the same thing
label2 May I continue
label2 After expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company  and moving it to California for the summer,  why did you put $18,000 in an account for his use
label2 I figured we were partners
label2 I wanted to be a team player
label2 I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on the site  while I was generating advertiser interest in New York
label2 Go, go, go, go, go
label2 I didn't die
label2 I made it
label2 You did
label2 Okay, ready
label2 That was like an 8
label2 That was like a 2
label2 Yeah
label2 I'm okay
label2 Yeah
label2 Yikes
label2 That's the doorbell
label2 I didn't know we had a doorbell
label2 No, he's wired in
label2 That's gonna cut into your security deposit
label2 Andrew
label2 Not now
label2 Sean
label2 Mark
label2 Do you live here
label2 Yeah
label2 Do you
label2 We were right across the street
label2 No
label2 You live across the street
label2 I'm Sharon
label2 She lives across the street
label2 I was helping her move out, we saw the chimney...  We had a zip line to the pool
label2 You came to California
label2 Yeah
label2 Here you go
label2 Sharon
label2 I'm so sorry
label2 I didn't know you were gonna..
label2 Here you go
label2 No, no, no
label2 Wait
label2 This house and this team are great
label2 I'm Sean Parker
label2 Oh, he's wired in
label2 Where's Eduardo
label2 He got an internship in New York
label2 Eduardo didn't come out
label2 I was crashing there for a little bit while I'm taking care of some things,  but she's done for the summer so she's back at her parents' place
label2 The homeless rock star of Palo Alto
label2 What's your plan for the summer
label2 Mark
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I was looking at the architecture
label2 I asked what your plan for the...  A hundred schools by the end of the summer
label2 Okay
label2 Yeah, I'll go with you
label2 She looks familiar to a lot of people
label2 What do you mean
label2 A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond wants to buy his wife some lingerie,  but he's too embarrassed to shop for it in a department store
label2 He comes up with an idea for a highend place  that doesn't make you feel like a pervert
label2 He gets a $40,000 bank loan, borrows another 40,000 from his inlaws,  opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret
label2 Makes a half million dollars his first year
label2 Happy ending, right
label2 Except two years later, the company's worth $500 million,  and Roy Raymond jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge
label2 Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife a pair of thighhighs, you know
label2 Was that a parable
label2 My date's a Victoria's Secret model
label2 God
label2 Don't be impressed by all this
label2 I read your blog
label2 You know why I started Napster
label2 The girl I loved in high school was with the cocaptain of the varsity lacrosse team,  and I wanted to take her from him
label2 So I decided to come up with the next big thing
label2 I didn't know that
label2 I changed the music industry for better and for always
label2 It may not have been good business, but it pissed a lot of people off
label2 And isn't that what your Facemash was about
label2 They're scared of me, pal, and they're gonna be scared of you
label2 What the VCs want is to say,  "Good idea, kid, the grownups will take it from here.
label2 But not this time
label2 This time, you're gonna hand them a business card that says,  "I'm CEO, bitch.
label2 That's what I want for you
label2 So where the hell is Eduardo
label2 Sucking up to ad execs
label2 He's got an...  An internship
label2 The company's here
label2 A billiondollar company's here
label2 Do you live and breathe Facebook
label2 I know you do
label2 Wardo wants to be a businessman and for all I know he's gonna be a good one,  but he shouldn't be in New York kissing Madison Avenue's ass
label2 This is a onceinageneration, "holy shit" idea
label2 Look at my face and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about
label2 Do you ever think about that girl
label2 What girl
label2 No
label2 If you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth, we need shots
label2 A hundred schools by the end of the summer
label2 Yeah
label2 Tell you what
label2 While you're getting into 100 schools, I'll put you on two continents
label2 Two..
label2 Let's line up some shots
label2 Excuse me
label2 Yes, sir
label2 You can take this away and bring back the 1942
label2 Absolutely, Mr. Parker
label2 Attention... Go
label2 At the barrier, Hollandia is leading Harvard University by one length
label2 Come on
label2 Whatever
label2 Mr. Winklevoss
label2 Tremendous race
label2 Thank you
label2 And this is my brother, Cameron
label2 Sir
label2 His Royal Highness Prince Albert
label2 Your Highness, this is Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss
label2 Brilliant race
label2 I've never seen a race that close
label2 Yes, Your Highness
label2 My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of the premier rowers of his day
label2 I've been coming to Henley for 30 years and I'd never seen a race that close
label2 Have you seen a race that close
label2 No, Your Highness
label2 Yes, that's absolutely right
label2 Brutally close
label2 May I introduce my teammates
label2 I'm sorry
label2 You'll have to excuse us
label2 On to the Dutch
label2 Sorry you flew all the way out here to see that
label2 Wouldn't have missed it, brother
label2 I just wanted him to tell me a couple more times how close the race was
label2 Just brutal, brutally close
label2 Jesus
label2 The guy is the prince of a country the size of Nantucket
label2 Boys
label2 Divya
label2 Dad
label2 Mr. Winklevoss
label2 That was a tough beat
label2 I'm sorry that you and Mom had to fly out here to see that
label2 Don't ever apologize to anyone for losing a race like that
label2 Boys
label2 Mr. Kenwright
label2 Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright, head of the host family for this week
label2 Pleasure to meet you
label2 Good to meet you
label2 She told me that she and her friends are already talking about the race,  which they've just seen via their computers
label2 A new website called Facebook
label2 Do you have this in America
label2 I'm gonna find your mother
label2 Your daughter doesn't go to school in the States
label2 No, no
label2 Cambridge
label2 And they have Facebook at Cambridge
label2 And apparently Oxford and the London School of Economics
label2 That's where her friends are
label2 That's awesome
label2 Take the bitter with the better, eh
label2 I'm gonna go watch the race film
label2 If this is online, I wanna see it
label2 Stop it
label2 Knock it off
label2 I don't mind that we lost to the Dutch today by less than a second
label2 That was a good race, and that was a fair race
label2 And they'll see us again
label2 What I mind, and what you should mind,  is showing up on Monday for a race that was run on Sunday
label2 Come on
label2 I need a real drink
label2 Screw it
label2 Let's gut the frigging nerd
label2 That's what I'm talking about
label2 But check it out, I saw him today
label2 Manningham, Mitchell Manningham, my Case Equity guy
label2 Hang on
label2 Are you guys using Spikes or Ghost Missiles
label2 We don't know, we're just shooting at each other
label2 Use Sweet Kamikazes
label2 I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera and he saw me, too
label2 I know he did
label2 Don't sweat it
label2 I'm on a landline
label2 Bong hit
label2 Does anybody hear that banging
label2 You don't hear anything
label2 Dude, somebody's at the door
label2 It's not a dish best served cold
label2 It's best served immediately and relentlessly
label2 I'm gonna call you back
label2 Mark was supposed to pick me up at the airport an hour ago
label2 I've been calling his cell
label2 What happened here
label2 Not happened
label2 Happening
label2 The next big thing
label2 Hey, man
label2 Back to work
label2 Okay
label2 The more bad I get at this, the more wasted I get
label2 I mean the more wasted that I get...  We understand
label2 How old are they, Sean
label2 Sean, how old are they
label2 You think you know me, right
label2 I've read enough
label2 You know how much I've read about you
label2 Nothing
label2 Wardo
label2 I waited an hour for you at the airport
label2 It's midnight
label2 Or 3:00 a.m
label2 In New York, where I just came from
label2 You gotta see some of the new stuff we got
label2 Hey, Dustin
label2 I'm just calling it the Wall
label2 Forget the Wall, tell him about the meeting I've got set up
label2 You know Peter Thiel
label2 Nope
label2 No reason you should
label2 Why's he setting up meetings
label2 Thiel might wanna make an angel investment
label2 I don't care if he's an actual angel
label2 Why is he setting up business meetings
label2 No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,  then a long wait at the passenger loading and unloading zone at SFO,  and in between there was a long flight
label2 I'm the business end of this company
label2 And he is a houseguest living here rent free  on a very generous grant from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation
label2 I heard about your bigticket ad buys
label2 Hey, man...  Harvard Bartending Course
label2 You're just a small step away from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it
label2 Sure
label2 Bong hit
label2 I'm so high
label2 No, you're not
label2 So how's it going
label2 How's the internship
label2 How's the internship
label2 Yeah
label2 Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship
label2 We talked about this on the phone
label2 I do remember you saying that
label2 So how is Christy
label2 Christy's crazy
label2 Is that fun
label2 No
label2 She's insanely jealous, she's irrational, and I'm frightened of her
label2 Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend
label2 I do not want that guy representing himself as part of this company
label2 You gotta move out here, Wardo, this is where it's all happening
label2 I'm afraid if you don't come out here, you're gonna get left behind
label2 I want..
label2 I need you out here
label2 Please don't tell him I said that
label2 What did you just say
label2 It's moving fast
label2 What did you mean
label2 And Sean thinks we have...  Sean is not part of this company
label2 We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,  and we're in 160 schools, including five in Europe
label2 I'm aware of that
label2 We need more servers than I ever expected we'd need
label2 We need more programmers and we need more money,  and he set up the Thiel meeting
label2 He set up other meetings
label2 Yes
label2 Without me knowing anything about it
label2 You're in New York
label2 I'm in New York riding subways 14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers
label2 And how's it going so far
label2 What did you mean, "get left behind"
label2 Can I help you
label2 I'd like to freeze this bank account  and cancel all existing checks and lines of credit
label2 May I see some ID, please
label2 Yeah, sure, sorry
label2 Sean, he'll be right with you
label2 That's comforting
label2 Hey, guys
label2 Come on back
label2 She offer you some waters
label2 Oh, yeah
label2 We're cool
label2 Sean, how are you
label2 Come on in
label2 Hi
label2 We took a look at everything, and congratulations
label2 We're gonna start you off with a $500,000 investment
label2 We'll file as a corporation in Delaware  and come up with a stock structure that allows for new investors
label2 Now, let me ask you something
label2 Who's Eduardo Saverin
label2 Jesus Christ
label2 You scared me
label2 I need you to knock
label2 When did you get back
label2 And when were you gonna call me
label2 Chris, it was kind of a rough trip and I was tired...  Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts
label2 Did you know I sent 47 texts
label2 I did, and I thought that was incredibly normal behavior
label2 I brought you a present
label2 Why does your Status say "single" on your Facebook page
label2 What
label2 Why does your Relationship Status say "single" on your Facebook page
label2 And you just never bothered to change it
label2 What
label2 I don't know how
label2 Do I look stupid to you
label2 No, calm down
label2 You're asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook  doesn't know how to change his Relationship Status on Facebook
label2 Go to hell
label2 Take it easy
label2 Not even remotely true, and I can promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts  don't care what anyone's Relationship Status is on Facebook
label2 Please, open your present
label2 Your phone does work
label2 It's Mark
label2 Okay, this is gonna be tricky
label2 Open your present
label2 This'll be your first
label2 Yeah
label2 You froze our account
label2 I did
label2 You froze the account
label2 I had to get your attention, Mark
label2 Do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company
label2 Do you realize that your actions could have destroyed  everything I've been working on
label2 Let me tell you the difference between Facebook and everybody else
label2 We don't crash ever
label2 If the servers are down for even a day, our entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed
label2 Look...  Users are fickle
label2 Friendster has proved that
label2 Even a few people leaving would reverberate through the entire user base
label2 That is the whole point
label2 College kids are online because their friends are online  and if one domino goes, the other dominos go
label2 Don't you get that
label2 I am not going back to the Caribbean Night at AEPi
label2 Holy shit
label2 What is wrong with you
label2 Did you like being a joke
label2 Do you wanna go back to that
label2 That was the act of a child, not a businessman,  and it certainly was not the act of a friend
label2 You know how embarrassing it was for me to try to cash a check today
label2 I am not going back to that life
label2 Maybe you were frustrated
label2 Yeah
label2 I was
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I was angry, and maybe it was childish, but I had to get your attention
label2 Wardo, I said I've got some good news
label2 What is it
label2 Peter Thiel just made an angel investment of half a million dollars
label2 What
label2 Half a million dollars
label2 And he's setting us up in an office
label2 They need your signature on some documents,  so you gotta get your ass on the first flight back to San Francisco
label2 I need my CFO
label2 I'm on my way
label2 Wardo
label2 We did it
label2 Wardo
label2 You're going back there already
label2 Yes
label2 Somebody stop her
label2 Four documents
label2 The first two are common stock purchase agreements,  allowing you to buy stock in the newly reincorporated Facebook,  as opposed to the old shares, which are now worthless
label2 The third is an exchange agreement  allowing you to exchange the old shares for new shares,  and then finally a voter holding agreement
label2 How many shares of stock will I own
label2 Jesus Christ
label2 That represents a 34.4% ownership share
label2 Why the increase from the original 30%
label2 I love working with business majors
label2 I'm telling you
label2 Economics
label2 Right
label2 You should know that Mark has already taken his percentage from 60 down to 51
label2 Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%
label2 Sean Parker, 6.47%
label2 I can live with that
label2 And Peter Thiel, 7%
label2 Would you like to use my pen
label2 Eduardo
label2 Eduardo
label2 Yes
label2 Would you read it back, please
label2 Well, go ahead
label2 "Counsel: 'And when you signed these documents,  "'were you aware that you were signing your own death certificate?"
label2 No
label2 It was insanely stupid of me not to have my own lawyers look over all the..
label2 In all honesty, I thought they were my lawyers
label2 I was your only friend
label2 My father won't even look at me
label2 Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say anything to you after you signed the papers
label2 There was a lot of handshaking, a lot of congratulations
label2 He'd already told me that he wouldn't be  coming back to school for at least a semester,  so we were saying goodbye for a while
label2 But you gotta come back
label2 Somewhere around the end of November or early December
label2 Peter wants to throw us an amazing party when we hit a million members
label2 It's gonna be out of control
label2 A million members
label2 Remember the algorithm on the window at Kirkland
label2 Yeah
label2 Yeah, I'll be here
label2 You sure about this
label2 You're 20 minutes late
label2 They're gonna pitch you
label2 Case Equity is going to pitch you
label2 You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod, you're gonna nod,  and then you're gonna say, "Which one of you is Roth?
label2 No, not Roth
label2 Manningham
label2 "Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?
label2 And he'll say, "I am.
label2 And then you say, "Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you."
label2 Walk out
label2 Okay
label2 It said that we had to have a business meeting
label2 That Mark and Sean had played some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,  and that Manningham was so impressed  that he was now making an investment offer that was hard to turn down
label2 So I went to California, and I went straight to the new offices
label2 I didn't know whether to dress for the party or for the business meeting,  so I kind of dressed for both
label2 But it didn't matter
label2 Because I wasn't called out there for either one
label2 What were you called out there for
label2 An ambush
label2 Mr. Saverin
label2 Hey
label2 Hey, man
label2 How are you
label2 How are you
label2 Good, good, good, good, good
label2 Good to see you
label2 At first I thought he was joking
label2 Giving me more contracts to sign
label2 Wait, what is this
label2 Well, as you know, we had some new investors that have come in
label2 What is this
label2 Mark
label2 Mark
label2 He's wired in
label2 Sorry
label2 He's wired in
label2 Is he
label2 Yes
label2 How about now
label2 Call security
label2 You issued 24 million new shares of stock
label2 How much were his
label2 What was Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership share diluted down to
label2 It wasn't
label2 What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share diluted down to
label2 It wasn't
label2 What was Sean Parker's ownership share diluted down to
label2 What was Peter Thiel's ownership share diluted down to
label2 And what was your ownership share diluted down to
label2 .03%   You signed the papers
label2 You set me up
label2 It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook
label2 It won't be like you're not a part of Facebook
label2 You're not a part of Facebook
label2 My name's on the masthead
label2 You might wanna check again
label2 This because I froze the account
label2 You think we'd let you parade around in your ridiculous suits,  pretending you were running this company
label2 Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's
label2 Security's here
label2 I'm not signing those papers
label2 We will get the signature
label2 Tell me this isn't about me getting into the Phoenix
label2 You... You did it
label2 I knew you did it
label2 You planted that story about the chicken
label2 I didn't plant that story
label2 You had me accused of animal cruelty
label2 Seriously
label2 What the hell's the chicken
label2 And I'll bet what you hated the most  is that they identified me as a cofounder of Facebook
label2 You better lawyer up, asshole
label2 'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%
label2 I'm coming back for everything
label2 Get him out of here
label2 Hang on
label2 Almost forgot
label2 Here's your $19,000
label2 I wouldn't cash it, though
label2 I like standing next to you, Sean
label2 It makes me look so tough
label2 Well...  That's it, that's our show for tonight, people
label2 We're gonna walk into that club like it's the Macy's Parade
label2 We've gotta almost be there
label2 You all right
label2 Yeah
label2 You were kind of rough on him
label2 You know you didn't have to be that rough on him
label2 Listen, I put him...  Sean
label2 You didn't have to be that rough on him
label2 He almost killed it
label2 I'll send flowers
label2 Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma
label2 Ashleigh's a sister
label2 The intern
label2 Yeah
label2 I know who she is
label2 Are you guys...  Ashleigh
label2 Me
label2 Why
label2 No
label2 Nothing, I just..
label2 Excuse me
label2 Mark
label2 We were just talking about you
label2 Just that you're doing a really good job
label2 Thanks
label2 Put them on my desk
label2 What's the package
label2 Nothing
label2 Mackey
label2 Refresh
label2 Sweet
label2 And you're not a hugger
label2 I know
label2 One million
label2 Who's got champagne
label2 Huh
label2 The next transformative development, a picturesharing application
label2 A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life
label2 It is the true digitalization of real life
label2 You can use a CD
label2 You don't just go to a party anymore
label2 You go to a party with a digital camera, and then your friends relive the party online
label2 And tagging
label2 The idea...   Would this be easier without the bra
label2 It's worth finding out
label2 The party's over
label2 Everybody, go home
label2 I've spent hours watching what people do when they log on
label2 Wait
label2 That's weird
label2 Check to see which one of their friends  changed their profiles, changed their photos..
label2 Seriously, what happened to the music
label2 We lived on farms and then we lived in cities,  and now we're going to live on the Internet
label2 Sean, stop
label2 I think something's going on downstairs
label2 It's time for you to go home
label2 The party is over
label2 Then it's all good
label2 It's the cops
label2 What
label2 Shit
label2 Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit
label2 Okay, it's okay
label2 Good to see you, Officer
label2 What can I do for you
label2 What's going on
label2 Was the music too loud
label2 We were having a celebration
label2 Miss, I need you to button your blouse
label2 Okay, we're gonna need identification
label2 Keep your hands where we can see them
label2 Oh, my God
label2 You got anything else in your pockets I should know about
label2 No, sir
label2 Don't be stupid, now
label2 I don't, I don't
label2 What's this
label2 That's an EpiPen
label2 And this
label2 That's my inhaler
label2 Twentyone
label2 Twentyone
label2 Lying only makes it worse
label2 I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied
label2 Hello
label2 Shit
label2 No, it's all right
label2 It's gonna be all right
label2 I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything
label2 I mean, I've got allergies
label2 Interns
label2 It was just a party
label2 This is gonna be news, Sean
label2 I know
label2 I have it under control
label2 I will get it under control
label2 I will call someone and see what the next move is
label2 But this is gonna be news now
label2 I mean, do you think...  No
label2 Or Manningham
label2 One of them
label2 Somebody
label2 Somebody sent the coke in there, because it got in there
label2 You believe me
label2 God, this is gonna be fine
label2 Go home, Sean
label2 Mark
label2 We're done for the day
label2 Yeah
label2 Yeah, I was just sitting here
label2 What happened to Sean
label2 All you had all day was that salad
label2 Do you wanna get something to eat
label2 I can't
label2 I'm not a bad guy
label2 When there's emotional testimony, I assume 85% of it is exaggeration
label2 And the other 15
label2 Creation myths need a devil
label2 What happens now
label2 Sy and the others are having a steak on University Avenue
label2 Then they'll come back up to the office,  and start working on a settlement agreement to present to you
label2 Oh, yeah
label2 And you're gonna have to pay a little extra
label2 Why
label2 So that these guys sign a nondisclosure agreement
label2 They say one unflattering word about you in public, you own their wife and kids
label2 I invented Facebook
label2 I'm talking about a jury
label2 What a jury sees when they look at a defendant
label2 Clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...  Likeability
label2 Watch what else
label2 Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party that night
label2 You think I'm the one that called the police
label2 Doesn't matter
label2 I asked the question, now everybody's thinking about it
label2 You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes
label2 Farm animals
label2 I was drunk and angry and stupid
label2 And blogging...  And blogging
label2 Pay them
label2 In the scheme of things,  it's a speeding ticket
label2 I can't imagine it would be a problem
label2 Thanks
label2 I appreciate your help today

label2 He wants his code in the afternoon edition
label2 <i>If the Examiner doesn't have the balls to run it, we scoop the Bay.</i>  <i>Al, this man is talking about shooting 12 people.</i>  And not running this might make him do that
label2 <i>If we run it, we might be setting a very dangerous precedent.</i>  <i>Oh, come on, now, it's newsworthy.</i>  <i>Well, giving some sick bastard a soapbox,</i>  what does that say to people
label2 Back up
label2 Is this Vallejo story true
label2 Paul
label2 What
label2 I cover crime in Vallejo
label2 Ten minutes.</i>  Let's shoot the code and call SFPD

label2 Sergeant Mulanax
label2 <i>Sergeant, Paul Avery from the San Francisco Chronicle.</i>  I just wanted to check  if you had an unsolved firearmrelated homicide  on Christmas and maybe one on July fourth
label2 Shit
label2 VPD, they confirmed the shootings.</i>  <i>Al's on the phone with the Examiner.</i>  They got the same letter with a different code
label2 <i>So did TimesHerald.</i>  <i>Christmas, two teenagers on lover's lane

label2 <i>But at some point,</i>  the county decided that the land would work better as a lake
label2 So they flooded it
label2 But there's an entire...  Hidden city under the water
label2 It is a public park
label2 I think he's watching us
label2 <i>Well, we're very goodlooking.</i>  Where'd he go
label2 He went behind that tree
label2 All right
label2 He's coming towards us
label2 <i>Oh, my God, he has a gun.</i>  Don't move
label2 I want your money and your car keys

label2 Here's the keys
label2 Don't get up
label2 Okay
label2 <i>You know, if he comes any closer, I might be able to get that gun.</i>   Don't get any ideas
label2 I'm not
label2 I killed a guard escaping from prison in Montana
label2 <i>I'm not doing anything, okay?</i>  I'm not afraid to kill again
label2 Look away

label2 Is the Zodiac a Satanist?</i>  <i>Amber from Oakland, what do you think?</i>  <i>I don't really know,</i>  <i>but I thought that code they printed didn't look very Christian.</i>  <i>But I think the bigger problem is that the papers shouldn't have printed</i>  <i>anything that the Zodiac has been doing.</i>  <i>That they're just printing all that stuff to sell more newspapers.</i>  <i>Well, the Zodiac did demand they print his letters</i>  <i>or he'd kill more people.</i>  <i>Yeah, but he would have done it anyway,</i>  <i>whether they printed it or not, I think.</i>  <i>An interesting point.</i>  <i>So, what do you think he'll do next?</i>  <i> San Francisco Police Department
label2 Yes
label2 There's a fight in a cab!</i>  <i>What is your location?</i>  <i>3398 Washington, at the corner of Cherry.</i>  <i>One's drunk and we think he's robbing him.</i>  <i> Is the crime still in progress
label2 Yes, please hurry.</i>  <i>Oh, my God, look!</i>  Nuts
label2 <i>Whoever this is, you owe me a new lamp.</i>  <i>Cabbie's been shot three blocks from the Presidio.</i>  <i>Well, it wasn't me

label2 <i> I just got to sleep
label2 Suspect's Negro, male adult.</i>  <i>Walt's on scene, locked up the cab and secured the crowd.</i>  <i>Seriously, dead asleep
label2 I lost feeling in my arm and everything.</i>  Crackers
label2 You ever try Japanese food
label2 <i> What do you mean, like teriyaki
label2 I'm eating here, Bill.</i>  <i> I always wanted to try it
label2 So, why don't you?</i>  Haven't got around to it
label2 <i>Evening, gents
label2 What a lovely night for a botched robbery.</i>  <i>Yeah, third this week
label2 Dousette pronounced him at 10:10
label2 Suspect fired one shot to the back of the head
label2 Driver's wallet and car keys are missing
label2 <i>Leroy, there, came down from Yellow Cab to ID him.</i>  <i>Neighborhood's pretty highend for this kind of thing,</i>  so I already set up transpo for the cab
label2 Coroner's here
label2 Kids who called it in saw the suspect from that window
label2 Did they hear a shot
label2 No
label2 <i>They first saw him in the front seat,</i>  thought he was a drunk fighting with the driver
label2 <i>Oldest kid ran downstairs to get a better look from the dining room,</i>  <i>described him as a white male, glasses,</i>  <i>crewcut, stocky, and wearing a dark jacket.</i>  <i>Wait, I thought someone said he was black.</i>  That's the description that went out to radio cars
label2 Oh, well, that's good.</i>   You guys need anything else
label2 No
label2 Get out of here
label2 Thanks
label2 Happy Birthday
label2 <i> Wait, it's your birthday
label2 Happy birthday
label2 Thanks
label2 <i> Body or scene
label2 It's your birthday, I'll take the body.</i>  <i>Dave, looks like he wiped the cab down pretty good.</i>   We got some blood over here
label2 Could very well be
label2 We'll dust it at the Hall
label2 <i>The odd thing is, we also got gloves.</i>   Suspect's
label2 <i> Hey, Pete
label2 Yeah, Dave.</i>  <i>You through over there, can I get in there?</i>  <i>Yeah, I'm all set.</i>   Who rolled him
label2 Stewarts
label2 <i>Yeah, Luger.</i>  Nothing from the crowd
label2 <i>Okay
label2 I'm your shooter, Negro male adult,</i>  <i>who also happens to be a stocky, crewcut Caucasian.</i>  I flag a cab
label2 I give him this address
label2 Did I give him this address
label2 Right here
label2 Washington and Maple
label2 <i>Lighting's the same over here,</i>  so maybe I see someone walking their dog
label2 You don't want any witnesses so you tell him to go down a block
label2 He pulls over
label2 I wait for him to put it in park because I'm smart  and I don't want him hitting the accelerator  when I shoot him
label2 <i>He stops, puts it in park, boom.</i>  <i>I shoot him on the right side, he slumps right?</i>  Maybe you've got your hand on his collar when you shoot
label2 <i>All right
label2 So, either way,</i>  I just dumped a quart of blood in the front seat
label2 <i> So, why do you get in the front seat
label2 For the money.</i>  But he's dead
label2 <i>You could just reach over the seat, pull out his wallet.</i>  You don't have to go anywhere near the blood
label2 <i>So, why'd he get in the front seat?</i>   I'm an idiot
label2 You waited for him to put it in park
label2 <i> Right
label2 Thank you
label2 Yeah, sure.</i>   Can I see that
label2 I am an idiot
label2 It's his third fare of the night
label2 Does anyone have any animal crackers
label2 Animal crackers

label2 I'm saving those for later
label2 Fine

label2 Partial
label2 <i>Dude, he wears his gun like Bullitt.</i>  <i>No, McQueen got that from Toschi.</i>  Does he think that Zodiac's gonna send another code

label2 <i>Can you send us everything that you have?</i>  <i>Well, the road goes both ways.</i>  <i>Now, we need that print you lifted from the cab</i>  <i>and we should have been in on the handwriting.</i>  I apologize
label2 Things have been moving fast
label2 <i>Who should I talk to in Napa so we can coordinate?</i>  Talk to Ken Narlow
label2 <i>I apologize
label2 Things have been moving fast.</i>  <i>Listen, we're gonna need your scene photos.</i>  Can't help you
label2 <i>Ken, I don't want to get into a jurisdictional thing here.</i>  <i>No, no, no, no, no
label2 We didn't have a crime scene.</i>  The ranger that found the kids literally swept everything into a picnic blanket
label2 <i>All we have are the Wing Walker prints.</i>  The what
label2 Boot prints to and from the crime scene  <i>were made by size 10andahalf Wing Walkers,</i>  militarystyle boots sold only at military PXs  designed to walk on the wings of planes
label2 <i>And you can't buy at a PX without a military ID,</i>  so our suspect could be military
label2 <i> Yeah
label2 Did Vallejo?</i>  I don't know
label2 I don't work in Vallejo
label2 Great
label2 I'm gonna need photos of those boot prints
label2 <i>Sure, if you send me the handwriting.</i>  I thought Questioned Documents already did
label2 <i>Nope
label2 Vallejo's got them, not us.</i>  All right
label2 Forget it
label2 We don't have telefax yet
label2 <i> Okay, I'll put it in the mail
label2 We'll mail ours, too.</i>  And call Mulanax in Vallejo
label2 Maybe he can get you a mimeo
label2 Right
label2 Why don't you just get a photo off the original plaster cast
label2 <i>We'd have to wait, because they don't have a fax.</i>  <i>We don't have a fax, either.</i>  <i>Look, I'm just trying to get us coordinated.</i>  Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office
label2 Why would I call Solano
label2 Bill
label2 Can I have a word with you
label2 Where did you see this guy
label2 We got the call to circle the scene and look for a Negro male adult
label2 Where was he
label2 On Jackson
label2 Heading east
label2 About the middle of the block
label2 And this is three minutes after the shooting
label2 Give or take
label2 Yeah
label2 And you were heading east or west
label2 Correct
label2 Did you slow down
label2 Of course we slowed down
label2 All right
label2 <i>Listen, Dispatch said it was a Negro male.</i>  That was corrected
label2 <i>No, but at the time they hadn't changed it.</i>  This guy was white
label2 <i>Right, not in a hurry
label2 What do you mean, "lumbering"?</i>   Shuffling
label2 Stocky
label2 Had a crew cut
label2 <i>Yeah, that's all correct.</i>  <i>Listen, it was dark.</i>  The guy was wearing a dark jacket
label2 There's no way..
label2 Did you stop him
label2 Yes
label2 No
label2 No
label2 You need to get with a sketch artist
label2 We have to put out a new composite right away
label2 No looming
label2 Have you considered the water theory
label2 <i>Geographically, every attack takes place near a body of water</i>   or a waterbased name
label2 This is your water theory
label2 Lake Berryessa
label2 Blue Rock Springs
label2 Lake Herman
label2 Washington and Cherry
label2 You think
label2 No
label2 ... and he says you look for patterns,</i>   so I'm looking for patterns
label2 No
label2 Why not
label2 You got four crime scenes
label2 <i>Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa, and here.</i>  Not a single usable print at the first three or in any of the letters
label2 How does our master criminal come to the city and leave a bloody latent
label2 <i>I mean, assuming the gloves are his,</i>  he shoots the cabbie and then takes them off
label2 <i>So it's not his print?</i>  <i>Maybe, maybe not
label2 They both die
label2 <i>From there on out, he only manages to kill the girls.</i>   Not for lack of trying
label2 Not for lack of trying
label2 Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.</i>  He gets so caught up with the women he forgets to finish off the men
label2 <i>Plus, they're all couples and all on lover's lanes.</i>   Paul Stine is not
label2 Exactly
label2 <i>So, why does Zodiac kill him?</i>  He's breaking the pattern
label2 Yeah
label2 <i>Someone claiming to be Zodiac called Oakland PD a halfhour ago.</i>  <i>He says he's gonna call in on Jim Dunbar's morning show in three hours.</i>  On television
label2 <i>He wants Melvin Belli on to counsel him.</i>  All right
label2 All right
label2 Let's go wake up Melvin
label2 Glove box
label2 Are these windows bulletproof
label2 <i>Yes, Melvin
label2 Are you sure you're up for this
label2 <i>Don't you worry about me, Inspector
label2 The man you're worrying about snuffing you out
label2 <i>What are these, cookies?</i>  <i>Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?</i>   Shit
label2 KGO must have tipped other stations
label2 <i>Get him talking
label2 Convince him to meet you somewhere.</i>  <i>If you see an opportunity,</i>  we want you to suggest Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown
label2 You'll be tracing the call
label2 Pacific Telephone says you need to keep him on the line for 15 minutes
label2 Clear the set
label2 <i>Here you go, you drunken reprobate.</i>  <i>We interrupt our regular program to bring you this news bulletin.</i>  <i>Welcome to this special edition of our show</i>  <i>in which we are joined by attorney Melvin Belli</i>  <i>who the Zodiac Killer personally requested to appear.</i>  <i>Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.</i>  <i> Good morning, Melvin
label2 Good morning, Jim.</i>  <i>So, the phone lines are open
label2 Mr. Belli is here.</i>  <i>Here to help, Jim.</i>  <i>Yes
label2 Good people
label2 <i>You know, I've often thought of becoming an actor fulltime.</i>  What was your character's name
label2 <i> Gorgon
label2 Gorgon
label2 Get the tape
label2 <i>Jim, we have a call
label2 We're going live.</i>  Hello
label2 Hello
label2 This is Melvin Belli
label2 Who am I speaking with
label2 <i>This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  Is there something I can call you that's a little less ominous
label2 <i>Sam.</i>  Sam
label2 <i> Sam
label2 Yes?</i>  Do you think you need medical care
label2 <i>Medical, not mental.</i>  Do you have health problems
label2 <i>I'm sick
label2 <i>I have headaches, too,</i>  but a chiropractor stopped them a week ago
label2 <i>I think I can help you, Sam.</i>  Sam
label2 <i>Sam, we'd like you to know that we are not tracing these calls.</i>  <i>It's a long, difficult process and ineffective with these short calls.</i>  Sam
label2 We're not tracing these calls
label2 <i>Okay.</i>  <i>Sam, you need to tell me what your problem is.</i>  <i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber.</i>  <i>I have headaches
label2 I kill, I don't get them.</i>  That is fucked up
label2 <i>You want to live, don't you
label2 Well, this is your passport.</i>  <i>How long have you been having these headaches?</i>  <i>Since I killed a kid.</i>  <i> Do you have blackouts
label2 Yes.</i>  <i> Do you have fits
label2 No
label2 <i>Yes.</i>  And why did you want to talk to Mr. Bailey
label2 <i>Why do you wanna talk to me, Sam?</i>  <i> I don't want to be hurt
label2 Why is he calling?</i>  <i> Hey, just a second, buddy
label2 I wouldn't think they would ask for capital punishment
label2 <i>We should ask the District Attorney.</i>  <i>Do you want me to do that, Sam?</i>  <i>Do you want me to talk to the District Attorney?</i>  <i>What was that, Sam?</i>  <i>I did not say anything.</i>  <i>We heard a scream.</i>  <i>That was my headache.</i>  You sound like you're in a great deal of pain
label2 <i>My head aches
label2 I'm so sick.</i>  <i>I'm gonna kill them.</i>  <i> Oh, okay
label2 I'm gonna kill those kids!</i>  Fantastic
label2 Just us
label2 Okay.</i>  <i>How about Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown?</i>  <i>No.</i>  <i>In front of the Daly City St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30.</i>  I'll see you there
label2 <i>Take care of yourself, Sam.</i>  <i>My, my, my.</i>  You fellows certainly know how to put on a secret meeting
label2 I have headaches.</i>  <i>I kill, I don't get them.</i>  <i>No, it's not him.</i>  It's the voice
label2 The voice is too high
label2 It's too young
label2 <i>All right
label2 I got it
label2 They pulled off the trace
label2 Our Daly City noshow called from a mental institution
label2 Calmer
label2 Might have actually been him
label2 "So I shall change my way of collecting slaves
label2 "I shall no longer announce to anyone when I commit my murders
label2 "I look like the description passed out only when I do my thing
label2 "The rest of the time I look entirely different
label2 "I shall not tell you what my disguise consists of when I kill
label2 <i>"As of yet I have left no fingerprints behind me,</i>  "contrary to what the police say
label2 "I wear transparent fingertips
label2 <i>"I enjoy needling the blue pigs
label2 Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.</i>  "You were using fire trucks to mask the sound of your cruising prowl cars
label2 <i>"Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up</i>  "to have your nose rubbed in your booboos
label2 <i>"If you cops think I am going to take on a bus the way I stated I was,</i>  "you deserve to have holes in your heads. 
label2 And you need to look at this
label2 <i>"Take one bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer,</i>  <i>"one gallon of stove oil,</i>  "and dump a few bags of gravel on top... "   Okay
label2 Okay
label2 We gotta call the Army and see if this  science experiment could actually work
label2 Another cipher
label2 They arrived this morning
label2 Are you planning to publish
label2 Robert
label2 We should have a drink
label2 <i>So, tell me about yourself.</i>   You married
label2 Divorced
label2 Two kids
label2 What do you do for fun
label2 I love to read
label2 I enjoy books
label2 Why you been going through my trash
label2 I'll come back to that
label2 How did you know he was gonna send another code
label2 I just guessed
label2 The first one seemed too easy
label2 <i>All right, this can no longer be ignored.</i>   What is that you're drinking
label2 It's an Aqua Velva
label2 You wouldn't make fun of it if you tried it
label2 A married couple who like puzzles
label2 So what's that tell us about the Zodiac
label2 He's no expert
label2 It's just a simple substitution code  like the one that we used to do as boy scouts
label2 <i>"A" is one, "B" is two.</i>  <i>We weren't all boy scouts, Robert.</i>  <i>Well, it's not that hard
label2 You just got to know where to start.</i>  In the first cipher...  You actually carry that around with you
label2 Why
label2 No reason
label2 The double "L."  Double "L."  <i>And what's the one word that we know that he'll use in here, at least once?</i>  <i> "Kill. 
label2 Right, "kill
label2 "</i>  <i>So the Hardens start looking for double symbols,</i>  <i>which they find here, here, and here.</i>  Each with the same two symbols preceding them
label2 So now they've got a repeating fourletter word  ending with two symbols that they assume stand for "L."  And since they think the whole word is "kill" then...  <i>Then you got your "K," you got your "I," and you're on your way.</i>  But how do you go from "A" is one and "B" is two  to figuring out this whole code
label2 <i>Well, same way I did
label2 You go to the library.</i>  <i>In this book,</i>  the author presents a very simple substitution code in the preface
label2 Eight of the 26 symbols that he suggests are found in this cipher
label2 <i>Yeah, but there are nonletter symbols</i>  because there's all these medieval ones
label2 The Zodiac Alphabet
label2 Jesus
label2 What do you want out of this
label2 What
label2 What's your angle
label2 This is good business for everyone but you
label2 How do you mean "business"
label2 Hey
label2 I'll be up in a minute
label2 <i> Hello
label2 Bill?</i>  There's not many basements in California
label2 <i>"Basement for future use
label2 "</i>  That's right
label2 Yeah, sure.</i>  <i>"Dear Melvin, this is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  <i>"I wish you a happy Christmas.</i>  <i>"The one thing I ask of you is this
label2 Please help me.</i>  "I cannot reach out for help because this thing in me won't let me. 
label2 Thank you
label2 "I am finding it extremely difficult to hold it in check  "and I am afraid I will lose control again  "and take my ninth and possibly tenth victim. 
label2 <i>Melvin, he's reaching out to you.</i>  Absolutely
label2 <i>Inspectors, he sent this letter directly to my residence.</i>  <i>It is a cry for help, intended as a private communiqué.</i>  <i>Which is why you contacted the Chronicle.</i>  The people have a right to know

label2 In the middle of last week
label2 I was away on safari
label2 What did you gentlemen do for Christmas
label2 You're looking at it
label2 Fascinating people
label2 Beautiful
label2 Savage
label2 Back to the killer who wrote to you
label2 Yes
label2 Of course
label2 It is my belief that he only penned this letter  because he couldn't get through to me on the Dunbar show or here
label2 He tried to contact you here
label2 <i>I was out, but he spoke with my housekeeper.</i>  Didn't leave a number
label2 He's kind of crafty like that
label2 Do you mind if I speak to her
label2 Not at all
label2 I'll be back
label2 Yeah
label2 She's right this way
label2 <i>Even though he tries to ignore it, it drives him.</i>  It's in his blood
label2 Could be
label2 <i>I didn't mean to scare you, but your right rear wheel is loose.</i>  Really
label2 <i>If you like, I could tighten the lugs up for you.</i>  If you don't mind
label2 <i>Well, you can't be too careful.</i>   All done
label2 Thank you
label2 No problem
label2 It's okay
label2 Are you okay
label2 Yeah, we're fine.</i>  Must have been worse than I thought
label2 I can give you a lift to a service station
label2 Okay
label2 It's okay
label2 Come on
label2 <i>Oh, is that okay?</i>  The more the merrier
label2 You shouldn't smoke
label2 It's a bad habit
label2 I think we just passed a filling station
label2 Do you always go around helping people in the night
label2 <i>When I'm done with them, they don't need much help.</i>  It's okay
label2 <i>Before I kill you,</i>  I'm gonna throw your baby out the window
label2 No
label2 Help
label2 Please
label2 No
label2 She flagged me down
label2 What happened to her
label2 I found her like this
label2 <i> What is it
label2 Please, he said...</i>   It'll be okay
label2 Tried to kill me
label2 Where's her baby
label2 She didn't have one when I stopped
label2 Where's your baby

label2 You hid it
label2 <i>"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  <i>"By the way, have you cracked the last cipher I sent you?</i>  <i>"I'm mildly curious as to how much money you have on my head now.</i>  <i>"I hope you do not think I was the one who wiped out that blue meanie</i>  <i>"with a bomb at the cop station,</i>  <i>"even though I talked about killing children with one

label2 That's because he's full of shit
label2 What do you mean
label2 Welcome
label2 Please put your stuff down
label2 <i>Looking for the Modesto Bee from March.</i>  I'm going to stand here and attempt not to vomit

label2 A woman and her baby abducted
label2 Fact
label2 <i> The car on fire
label2 Okay, now,</i>  <i>look at the article from the Bee.</i>  Seen it yet
label2 And he's done it before
label2 <i>Officer Richard Radetich, shot sitting in his car.</i>  Zodiac claimed that he shot someone in their car
label2 Couple days after this article came out
label2 <i>Zodiac didn't do it, but took credit for it anyway</i>  because he's in it for the press
label2 He even stole his symbol
label2 What
label2 Yeah
label2 <i>If I show you something, you promise not to tell anyone?</i>   Who would I tell
label2 Okay
label2 Totally solid point
label2 Okay
label2 The guy stole his logo off a watch
label2 How can somebody who's killed 13 people do...  <i>He claims he's killed 13 people,</i>  but which ones can we actually confirm
label2 <i>There's three in Vallejo, one in Berryessa, the cabbie
label2 That's it.</i>  <i>Bobby, you almost look disappointed.</i>  Chief's pulling everybody off buses
label2 Business as usual
label2 Not a peep in four months
label2 First he won't shut up and now...  Maybe we drove him underground
label2 Maybe he's gone
label2 <i>311 at 582 Haight, cross at Biltmore

label2 Nobody calls me that
label2 Right

label2 It's near L.A.  <i>Oh, wow
label2 I don't think Paul knows that it's that far away.</i>  Sounds kind of dangerous
label2 Yeah
label2 <i>Well, you said it was an anonymous tip, right?</i>  Yeah
label2 I mean, it could be the Zodiac.</i>  Don't you think it's kind of stupid

label2 Who
label2 <i>A woman outside of Modesto, might be a Zodiac victim.</i>  Might
label2 Might be
label2 Okay
label2 <i>A typewritten confession was sent to the Riverside Press Enterprise</i>  <i>on November 29th, a month after Bates's murder.</i>  They ran it
label2 "I'm not sick
label2 I am insane
label2 "This letter should be published for all to read.

label2 Sherwood got a handwriting match off wood

label2 <i>To be honest with you,</i>  <i>our letters and your letters, I don't see it.</i>  How did Paul Avery get his hands on the exemplars
label2 I gave them to him
label2 We talked on the phone the other day for about an hour
label2 You told him we were meeting
label2 Yeah
label2 I also told him we don't think this is Zodiac
label2 <i>Okay, wait a minute.</i>   You don't think this is Zodiac
label2 We got a guy we like for it
label2 <i>If you don't think this is Zodiac, then why give anything to Avery?</i>  I'm trying to cooperate
label2 <i>Oh, that's how you cooperate
label2 <i>Zodiac reads it in the paper, and he writes a letter taking credit for it.</i>  <i>Now, that's something he's done before.</i>  <i>Look, now you have everything we have.</i>  <i>But, in my opinion, you guys came south for nothing.</i>  <i>FUBAR, gentlemen, FUBAR.</i>  I don't care what he says
label2 This still could be Z
label2 The problem is the entire state already thinks it is
label2 <i>Well, there's your press agent
label2 Talk to him about it.</i>  I come in peace
label2 I don't want any trouble
label2 Not now.</i>  <i> Just trying to do my job
label2 Well, now I can't do mine.</i>  <i>We're already screwed with the amount of tips we got on this thing,</i>  and you just freaked out the entire state

label2 Says how you can put a light at the end of a gun  to use as a sight in the dark
label2 He said that
label2 Yeah
label2 "</i>  <i>And he said, "It would be easy</i>  "'cause there'd be no real motive to the thing. 
label2 Then he said he'd write letters to the police  and call himself Zodiac to mess with them
label2 Leigh liked messing with people
label2 You're positive he said "Zodiac"
label2 Yeah
label2 So I told him
label2 Did you feel like he'd been thinking about it a long time
label2 He was raw about losing his job at the school
label2 He talked about shooting out the tires of a school bus  and picking off the little darlings
label2 He actually used those words
label2 <i>Afterwards, I told my wife I didn't wanna see him again.</i>  And I haven't since
label2 <i>Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.</i>  I know he's been up to that lake a bunch of times
label2 Lake Berryessa
label2 Couple times
label2 We went fishing by Putah Creek near there
label2 Tell him when you put it together
label2 <i>About a year ago, in the paper, there was a story about the Zodiac.</i>  And it all comes back
label2 I tried to call the local cops
label2 They blew him off
label2 Thought he was a nut
label2 I started a new job in L.A. On January 20th
label2 I had to move
label2 <i> This is my problem
label2 <i>I don't know
label2 He's angry, he's been drinking,</i>  been thinking about it for a while
label2 I can buy that
label2 I checked
label2 He did
label2 First recorded contact with the police department about Allen  <i>was in Pomona
label2 January 10th, 1970.</i>  He just got lost in the shuffle
label2 Did Allen screw his wife or anything
label2 We're gonna do a full background check
label2 <i>But I got to tell you, I like this guy.</i>  <i>So, let's pull some handwriting samples.</i>  Hi
label2 I talked to Sherwood
label2 He got the samples
label2 What are you having
label2 BLT
label2 There's not enough handwriting.</i>  <i>The application's got more, but it doesn't look like Z's,</i>  <i>so he can't rule him in
label2 He needs more samples.</i>  <i>Also, our guy is a pervert.</i>  <i>When Mel got the application from Valley Springs,</i>  they told him that Allen had been fired for touching kids
label2 Touching
label2 Polite euphemism
label2 Make some phone calls
label2 Are you done with the fries
label2 Go ahead
label2 <i>Did you and Mr. Cheney have a chance</i>  <i>to look at the copies of the Zodiac letters we sent you?</i>  Yeah
label2 Some of this stuff is pretty creepy
label2 <i> Yeah, we know that
label2 I mean, creepy like Leigh.</i>  He misspells words like that
label2 What about the handwriting
label2 <i>I don't know
label2 Don't you have experts for that stuff?</i>  Our man at Questioned Documents says it's inconclusive
label2 Maybe he did it with his other hand
label2 He's ambidextrous.</i>  <i>He can write with either hand
label2 Didn't you guys know that?</i>  <i>In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.</i>  <i>Job applications, letters to friends, et cetera.</i>  But he writes the Zodiac letters with his right hand  producing a different handwriting that he can't be linked to
label2 <i>We got to see this guy, Chief.</i>   Where is he
label2 <i>He works at Union Oil in Pinole
label2 His brother's up there, too.</i>  See them both
label2 Make sure you call Mulanax
label2 It is his backyard
label2 <i>Oh, right, because that worked so well for us in Riverside.</i>  <i>Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.</i>  <i>You can talk to him in here
label2 Coke machine's busted, by the way.</i>  I'll go get him for you
label2 <i>Well, Bill talked to the informants
label2 <i>Mr
label2 Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.</i>  This is Inspector Dave Toschi and Sergeant Jack Mulanax
label2 We're investigating the Zodiac murders in San Francisco and Vallejo
label2 <i>Please, sit down.</i>  The informant notified us that you made certain statements  11 months prior to the first Zodiac murder
label2 <i>If they're true, they're quite incriminating.</i>  Do you recall having any such conversation
label2 No
label2 When it was first in the paper
label2 Why not
label2 Too morbid
label2 I..
label2 I told all this to the other officer
label2 Which other officer
label2 From Vallejo
label2 <i>No, but it was right after the murder at the lake.</i>  And what did you tell this officer
label2 I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point that weekend to skin dive
label2 That I was alone but I met a couple there
label2 I have their names at home if you want them
label2 <i>That would be great, Arthur.</i>   Leigh
label2 What
label2 Nobody calls me Arthur
label2 <i>Also, that day when I came home, my neighbor saw me.</i>  It was around 4:00
label2 Neighbor's name
label2 Bill White
label2 He died a week or so afterwards
label2 Heart attack
label2 So I didn't think to call to follow up
label2 <i>The knives I had in my car with the blood on them,</i>  that blood came from a chicken that I killed for dinner
label2 I had knives in my car that weekend
label2 Maybe Bill saw them and called the other officer on me
label2 <i>Well, we'll be checking in on that.</i>  <i>Well, let me ask you something else.</i>  Were you ever in Southern California at any time in 1966
label2 Yes
label2 <i>Well, I guess I was there around that time.</i>  I used to go down there a lot
label2 I like the auto races
label2 Informant says that you're ambidextrous
label2 <i>My teachers tried to make me when I was a kid, but I couldn't.</i>  I'm lefthanded
label2 He also said that you made statements about killing school children
label2 That is... That's a horrible thing to say
label2 <i>So, you weren't angry about being fired from Valley Springs</i>  for touching your students
label2 I'm not the Zodiac
label2 <i>And if I was, I certainly wouldn't tell you.</i>  That's a nice watch
label2 Thank you
label2 May I see it
label2 Where'd you get it
label2 It was a Christmas gift from my mother two years ago
label2 <i>So, tell me something, Arthur.</i>  You don't remember anyone  you might have had a conversation with regarding the Zodiac
label2 Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker at Vallejo Recreation
label2 But I couldn't be positive
label2 I used to work there when...  <i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>  What
label2 <i>The Most Dangerous Game
label2 That's why you're here, isn't it?</i>  It was my favorite book in high school
label2 <i>Because he was tired of hunting animals,</i>  he hunted the people for the challenge
label2 And man is the most dangerous animal of all
label2 That's the whole point of the story
label2 Great book
label2 <i>Or, at least, that's what I told Phil.</i>  May I go
label2 I'm willing to help in any way possible
label2 I look forward to the day  when police officers are no longer referred to as pigs
label2 Thanks
label2 We'll be in touch
label2 These are copies of some of the Zodiac letters that were sent
label2 We'd like you to take a look at them
label2 You think my brother's the Zodiac
label2 <i>Well, we're looking at him.</i>  Are you going to arrest him
label2 <i>Mrs
label2 Allen, we don't arrest people just because we're interested in them.</i>  <i>Well, Leigh's always been troubled.</i>  Is it true about the children
label2 Unfortunately
label2 What are your feelings about Don Cheney
label2 Don Cheney
label2 Was he the one who contacted you
label2 That's confidential
label2 <i>Well, Don's a very reliable guy.</i>  <i>If he were to tell you something, I'd believe it to be true.</i>   This one
label2 What about it
label2 "</i>  We got a Christmas card from Leigh a couple years ago
label2 He spelled it the exact same way
label2 Christmass
label2 Would you still have that
label2 Thank you
label2 That'd be great
label2 Is there anything else we can do to help
label2 <i>The brother said he would search Leigh's apartment</i>  next time he went out of town
label2 That gets you around a warrant
label2 <i>If we do find something, Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo,</i>  and we could search the place properly
label2 Now I got a chance to talk to the cop  who interviewed Leigh Allen two days after the Berryessa murders
label2 But you do
label2 I wish I could've taken the guy in there
label2 <i>Take it slow, Dave
label2 Try and find more stuff for Sherwood.</i>  A match'll get us farther on the warrants
label2 Avery's on two
label2 Tell him to screw
label2 You want me to communicate that verbatim or can I spice it up a little
label2 <i> Paul, I've been thinking...  Oh, God save us all.</i>  The letter to Melvin Belli  was sent exactly one year after the Lake Herman Road murder
label2 And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father  was sent exactly six months after her death
label2 She was killed a day before Halloween
label2 Yeah
label2 And you received a Halloween card...  <i>You know, these are all fascinating pieces of news, Robert,</i>  it's a bit early in the day
label2 I didn't mean to wake you up
label2 No, no, no.</i>  <i> I just thought that...  No, no, no.</i>  This suspect is not your Zodiac
label2 Perfectly
label2 <i>So we've just retested the left hand
label2 I'm sorry
label2 Just not gonna work
label2 <i> Homicide, Toschi
label2 Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.</i>  Hey
label2 Mulanax
label2 Yeah
label2 <i>We struck out with the judge.</i>  <i>He won't sign off on a warrant for Allen's house.</i>   Why not
label2 <i>Now, unless we bring him a handwriting match or some evidence that...</i>  How are we gonna get evidence if we can't toss the house
label2 <i>I don't know.</i>  <i> I truly am sorry
label2 No, no
label2 Thank you, Jack.</i>  What do you wanna do
label2 Don't know what I can do without Vallejo
label2 We can't get it without a warrant
label2 Are there other guys you should be looking at
label2 <i>Only, what?</i>  Twentythree hundred
label2 <i>Okay, then.</i>  <i>Okay, then.</i>  <i>Paul, you wrote the Justice Department</i>  asking to be put in charge of the Zodiac investigation
label2 ...that those with intimate knowledge of the case  create an information clearinghouse  to promote an exchange and free flow of ideas
label2 Well, who better than me?</i>  The marked man
label2 <i>Paul, if you want to work here, I need three things.</i>  <i>One, stop boozing.</i>  <i>Two, stop doing whatever else it is you're doing.</i>  <i>And three, cut this nonsense out.</i>  <i>Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time</i>  <i>you feel my excellent work is no longer in step with this trashy provincial rag,</i>  I'll more than happily...  More than happily decamp for greener pastures
label2 <i>Paul, I mean it!</i>   Paul
label2 Yep
label2 What was that
label2 An editorial têteàtête
label2 It's 10:00 in the morning
label2 Late breakfast
label2 No
label2 Thank you for asking
label2 Shorty
label2 Let's go out for one
label2 <i>Paul, where are you going?</i>  <i>So, you moved off my brotherinlaw?</i>  We couldn't get a warrant
label2 Last year we arranged for Leigh to get help from a social worker
label2 He only went twice
label2 My motherinlaw brought him by to see the new baby
label2 Because of patient confidentiality..
label2 The man said yes
label2 Why hadn't you seen him in nine months
label2 Santa Rosa
label2 Where is he living
label2 In his trailer
label2 In Santa Rosa
label2 Sonoma County
label2 We wouldn't have to go through the Vallejo DA
label2 <i>It's been 11 months since you talked to this guy,</i>  and now you wanna search his trailer
label2 <i>If we find something, great.</i>  <i>If not, we get his prints and handwriting samples from both hands.</i>  I thought Sherwood shut you down
label2 I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes
label2 He trained me at this
label2 Between you and me
label2 Because there are differing schools of thought on this
label2 If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.</i>  <i>That's the current thinking, according to Terry Pascoe.</i>  <i>Meanwhile, I spoke to a psychologist who'd be willing to testify</i>  that someone who undergoes a personality change like Zodiac  <i>would manifest it physically, altering his handwriting.</i>  Which is why Sherwood couldn't get a match from Allen's samples
label2 <i>We got Terry Pascoe, this psychology guy,</i>  coupled with Cheney..
label2 It could be enough for a warrant
label2 Get Cheney on the record
label2 "And that he would call himself Zodiac. 
label2 Yes
label2 <i>Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney
label2 Thank you very much for your time.</i>  Thank you
label2 <i>Lives in Sunset Trailer Court in Santa Rosa, California.</i>  Physical description
label2 <i>Allen is similar in height, weight and build</i>  to a man seen at Lake Berryessa on the day of the stabbings
label2 <i>I understand he doesn't look much like the San Francisco composite.</i>  <i>True
label2 Height and weight are sketchy,</i>  but lumbering Caucasian with a crew cut is right on
label2 We never had much confidence in the composite from the kids
label2 The patrolman who saw Zodiac that night  said he didn't look much like the sketch
label2 Allen was in the Navy
label2 Wears a size 10andahalf
label2 Same size as the prints found at Berryessa
label2 <i>What about gun?</i>  Cheney says Allen owns several firearms
label2 <i> And the ciphers
label2 Could be code training in the Navy,</i>  and people have seen Allen with ciphers in the past
label2 <i>Really
label2 And Phil Tucker told us about a conversation that he had with Allen  about how to attach a flashlight to the barrel of a gun
label2 That gives us two sources on the ciphers and two on the flashlight
label2 <i>What about his threats on children?</i>  Suspect worked for elementary schools  <i>and was fired for molestation in March, April '68.</i>  <i> Could give him motive
label2 At the very least, it's home turf.</i>  <i>He'd have knowledge of bus routes,</i>  which the two major threats centered around
label2 <i>What about the bomb?</i>  Allen works as a chemist
label2 Take him through the geography
label2 Vallejo murders
label2 Berryessa murder
label2 <i>Does he have any alibis?</i>  <i>He claimed he did, but he's been unable to produce the names</i>  of the couple he supposedly met on the day of Berryessa
label2 The bottom line is that Allen can't alibi up on anything
label2 <i>Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.</i>  <i> You want to tell me about the name
label2 What name?</i>  Zodiac
label2 Allen wears a watch that bears both the word and crosshair symbol
label2 <i> John...  That's pretty good, guys.</i>  <i> We think so, too
label2 Let's take it to a judge.</i>  Mr. Allen
label2 This is the Santa Rosa Police Department
label2 We have a warrant to search your residence
label2 Hello
label2 Close the door
label2 You think somebody tipped him
label2 We're not leaving till he comes back
label2 I'll check the back
label2 Jesus
label2 What
label2 Squirrels
label2 We'll have those checked for blood
label2 And a pair of black gloves
label2 <i>Dave, I got a gun
label2 Check that
label2 Two guns.</i>  <i>They're both
label2 22s
label2 For little darlings bouncing off buses
label2 Someone's here
label2 <i>Hello, Arthur
label2 Remember us?</i>  No
label2 <i>Ballistics, no match
label2 Prints, no match
label2 Writing, no match.</i>  <i>On both hands, right?</i>  Because we got handwriting from both his hands
label2 And neither hand matches
label2 Forget Sherwood
label2 Let's get another opinion
label2 Hey
label2 What do you want
label2 A hug
label2 Do you know what the worst part of this is
label2 I can't tell if I wanted it to be Allen so bad  <i>because I actually thought it was him, or I just want all this to be over.</i>  It's because you thought it was him
label2 <i>And I did, too.</i>  You know what
label2 Take some time off
label2 Go to Candlestick
label2 See a movie
label2 <i>"To the city of San Francisco, I will enjoy killing one person every day</i>  <i>"until you pay me $100,000.</i>  <i>"If you agree, say so tomorrow morning</i>  <i>"in the personal column San Francisco Chronicle,</i>  <i>"and I will set up meeting.</i>  <i>"If I do not hear from you,</i>  <i>"it will be my next pleasure to kill a Catholic priest or a...</i>  <i>"...

label2 <i>So,</i>  what's new
label2 Yeah
label2 Somebody should write a book
label2 <i>Somebody should write a fucking book, that's for sure.</i>   About what
label2 It's not new
label2 <i>I've been thinking that if you put all the information together,</i>  maybe you could jog something loose
label2 Yeah
label2 That's true
label2 <i>You know all the players, and you have all the files.</i>  Lost them
label2 You lost them
label2 I don't know
label2 I moved onto a boat
label2 <i>You know that we work in the daily business, right?</i>  <i>As in, today.</i>  What do you think we were doing back then
label2 Do you know that more people die in the East Bay commute  every three months than that idiot ever killed
label2 <i>He offed a few citizens,</i>  <i>he wrote a few letters, and he faded into a footnote.</i>  Not that I haven't been sitting here idly  waiting for you to drop by and reinvigorate my sense of purpose
label2 Let it fucking go
label2 You're wrong
label2 It was important
label2 <i>Oh, that's right, I forgot
label2 You went to the library.</i>  I'm sorry I bothered you
label2 <i> Hey, hi
label2 Hi.</i>   Where you been
label2 Thank you
label2 <i> Inspector Toschi
label2 Yeah
label2 Hi
label2 We met at the movies once
label2 It must have been magical
label2 <i>I'm Robert Graysmith
label2 I work at the Chronicle.</i>  I was wondering if I could buy you lunch
label2 I was wondering if I could buy you lunch
label2 I wanted to ask you about Zodiac
label2 <i>Well, I appreciate the interest, but we don't discuss open cases.</i>  <i>Oh, well, what's going on with it, day to day?</i>  We're actively pursuing all leads
label2 <i>And you're the only one on it, right?</i>  <i>Mr
label2 Graysmith,</i>  Zodiac hasn't written in three years
label2 You know how many murders we've had in San Francisco since then
label2 No
label2 That's a lot of dead people and grieving families that need our help
label2 I care
label2 Okay
label2 Can I show you something
label2 I've been doing research on the first cipher
label2 Everything an amateur would need to create it  can be found in these books
label2 <i>So, I remember you thought that Zodiac was military,</i>  so I went to every base library and I got a list of every person  who's ever checked out these books and that's when I found this
label2 Missing
label2 It means they were stolen
label2 Somebody didn't want a record of ever having checked out these books
label2 Who are you again
label2 I just wanna help
label2 I can't discuss the case with you
label2 <i>I can't give you information, and I certainly couldn't tell you</i>  to go see Ken Narlow in Napa
label2 N ARLOW
label2 <i>I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith, but we don't cooperate with writers.</i>  <i>Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.</i>   And Dave Toschi sent you
label2 Why
label2 Maybe he...  Maybe he thought that I could do some good
label2 <i> What are you, some kind of boy scout
label2 Eagle Scout, actually, first class.</i>  <i>Well, if you wanna do this, don't let me stop you.</i>  <i>Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.</i>  I understand what you're trying to do
label2 But this is an open police investigation
label2 I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's
label2 And he said that you might be able to help
label2 <i>I mean, the case is dead
label2 <i>So, what's the harm?</i>  <i>No pens, no paper.</i>  <i>Anything that you see that's relevant, you got to remember in your head.</i>  Okay
label2 <i>Okay, here we go.</i>   Which one
label2 All of them
label2 And there's more in the next room
label2 <i>You don't smoke, do you?</i>  Once
label2 In high school
label2 What's this
label2 Thank you
label2 <i>Man, you really creeped us out.</i>  <i>"Nine millimeter.</i>  <i>"Said nothing and began firing
label2 "</i>  "Most Dangerous Game
label2 <i>"Do not eliminate this suspect because of handwriting.</i>  <i>"Not because of handwriting.</i>  <i>"Darlene's sister, Linda.</i>  "It was all just deep breathing
label2 George
label2 George
label2 Strange man. 
label2 <i>Oh, briefcase
label2 Oh, thanks.</i>  <i> Hey, Jack
label2 Hey, Bawart.</i>   Who's that
label2 Some cartoonist
label2 Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac
label2 <i>Well, good for him.</i>  <i> Thank you for meeting me, Inspector
label2 No
label2 We're not meeting, Robert.</i>  We're just two guys who happen to be sitting  on the same bench at the same time
label2 I've got five minutes
label2 I've got to get back to the Hall
label2 As far as you know, did anyone ever get in touch</i>  with Mike Mageau during your investigation   and show him suspect photos
label2 Why
label2 You've got four minutes now
label2 Darlene Ferrin was being followed
label2 <i>Now, I know Mulanax says that they already found this guy,</i>  a George Waters
label2 But he also said that she had a lot of admirers  who would come to the restaurant where she worked
label2 She was popular
label2 Yeah
label2 So...  <i>She and her husband, they move into their new house,</i>  and one night they throw this painting party
label2 And what's a painting party
label2 Sounds like a terrible party
label2 <i>Well, supposedly, somebody who's not Waters shows up.</i>  And Darlene is terrified of him
label2 So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac
label2 <i>And if Zodiac knew Darlene, then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.</i>  Maybe
label2 But Mageau's gone
label2 <i>So if you wanna connect Darlene to Zodiac,</i>  you're gonna have to find another way
label2 Phone calls the night of Darlene's murder
label2 <i> Yeah, Zodiac called the police
label2 No, Dave, there were four other calls.</i>  <i>There were two to Darlene's house, one to Darlene's brotherinlaw,</i>  and one to Darlene's fatherinlaw
label2 Just heavy breathing
label2 Yeah
label2 God damn it
label2 <i>It's got to be more than just a coincidence, right?</i>  <i>I mean, somebody doesn't just randomly prank phone call a victim's entire family</i>  90 minutes after they were shot
label2 <i>So, either Zodiac shoots a random couple,</i>  then he recognizes Darlene...  Or Darlene was shot on purpose
label2 <i>Either way, Zodiac had to have known Darlene.</i>  <i>That's good, Robert.</i>  <i>So, I can't find Mageau, so maybe I can find Darlene's sister.</i>  And maybe she can tell me who this mystery man is
label2 Try that
label2 I've got to go
label2 <i>You know,</i>  it's interesting that you should mention Zodiac calling people at home
label2 He did that in San Francisco once
label2 What
label2 I can't tell you
label2 That's privileged information
label2 But maybe Melvin Belli could
label2 Melvin Belli
label2 <i> He should be along soon
label2 Oh, that's all right.</i>  <i>I've really..
label2 <i>Oh, cookies
label2 Thank you
label2 These look great.</i>   You are here on business
label2 I'm writing a book about the Zodiac
label2 I remember that
label2 I spoke to him
label2 No, to the Zodiac when he called.</i>  He said he had to kill because it was his birthday
label2 He said it..
label2 Wait
label2 He said it was his birthday
label2 Yes
label2 You want something to drink
label2 Oh, so many years ago.</i>  Mr. Belli was away for Christmas
label2 Gone for a week
label2 <i>The Zodiac called, wanting to talk to him.</i>  <i>I said, "He is not here
label2 Today is my birthday
label2 Then the letter arrived
label2 <i>So, the call came before the letter of December 20th.</i>  Mr. Belli was gone for a week
label2 He came back on Christmas
label2 Not a good day to work
label2 <i>So, he left on the 18th.</i>  Is that helpful
label2 She said it was his birthday
label2 <i>Well, you'd have to confirm that, now wouldn't you?</i>  How
label2 <i>Well, I never spoke to her, but maybe my partner did.</i>  <i> How do I get a hold of him
label2 Bill wanted out of this.</i>  <i>As far as I'm concerned, he should stay out.</i>  How do I confirm it
label2 Mel Nicolai.</i>  <i> Thank you
label2 Goodbye.</i>  I just need to confirm a date
label2 Mr. Graysmith..
label2 I've narrowed it down  <i>between the 18th and the 20th of December, and I just need...</i>  <i>Okay, I'll play
label2 Let's say this phone call did take place.</i>  Let's say it really was Zodiac
label2 Why would he volunteer the day he was born
label2 <i>He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.</i>  What if he made a mistake
label2 What if he wasn't lying
label2 What if it was him on the phone
label2 <i>He didn't expect to pick it up, a nice person to pick up.</i>  What if
label2 What if
label2 None of the suspects had the same birthday as this phantom caller
label2 Bill Armstrong
label2 Can I give you a piece of advice
label2 You're looking in the wrong place
label2 <i>Handwriting, fingerprints, that's what this whole thing's about.</i>  Stick to the evidence
label2 Hi
label2 Hey
label2 Long
label2 Who's Sherwood Morrill
label2 He's a handwriting expert in Sacramento
label2 He called
label2 <i>Oh, great.</i>   So you're taking off work
label2 Just an hour
label2 Sacramento's two hours away
label2 Really
label2 Yes
label2 <i>Oh, that's that article.</i>  "Robert Graysmith has quietly been shopping his book about the Zodiac. 
label2 Yeah
label2 It talks all about you researching Zodiac
label2 <i>Well, that's what the article's about.</i>  I'm not so sure that's something we want people to know about
label2 Are you embarrassed
label2 <i>Robert, what's the one thing we know about Zodiac?</i>  <i>He reads the Chronicle.</i>  <i>Yeah, but he's never gonna read Herb Caen.</i>  <i> Hello
label2 I can tell you who the Zodiac is.</i>  Who is this
label2 <i>The Zodiac Killer is obsessed with movies.</i>  <i>He recorded his murders on film.</i>  <i>I tried to tell the police, but they wouldn't follow through on it.</i>  <i>There's a man you need to find
label2 His name is Bob Vaughn.</i>  <i> Pen, pen
label2 V AUGHN.</i>  <i>He's a friend of the Zodiac's.</i>  <i>Mr
label2 Who is this friend?</i>  <i>You have quite enough to get started.</i>  <i>Oh, please.</i>  <i>The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.</i>  Your toast is burning
label2 We choose at some point in our lives how to physically construct each letter
label2 <i>Once we lock that into our brains,</i>  <i>our handwriting may change over the years,</i>  but the moves themselves remain unaltered
label2 Understand
label2 Yes
label2 Except Zodiac's doesn't
label2 We don't know
label2 <i>Excuse me, I've got to spray this.</i>  How many suspects were cleared through handwriting
label2 All of them
label2 Also the print in the cab
label2 No match was ever found
label2 Is there any way that someone could beat a handwriting test
label2 No
label2 He said he knew who the Zodiac was
label2 Gave me a name
label2 Rick
label2 Rick Marshall
label2 Yeah
label2 <i>I think that the man who you talked to called me, too.</i>  <i>After he left, then I checked my files.</i>  I never cleared a Rick Marshall
label2 Hello
label2 Who is this
label2 It's a wrong number
label2 Does the name Rick Marshall mean anything to you
label2 What are you after
label2 <i>Hypothetically, you just named my favorite suspect in the whole case.</i>  This is off the record
label2 <i>Couple years back, I was trying to get Marshall's prints.</i>  I handed him a photo
label2 <i>He looks at it
label2 He's about to give it back and he stops and he says,</i>  <i>"My goodness, I got fingerprints all over this
label2 Why didn't you test him for handwriting
label2 <i>Because when they finally did run his prints,</i>  they cleared him against the one in Stine's cab
label2 <i> So, then, it's not him
label2 Maybe yes, maybe no.</i>  No
label2 What do you mean
label2 <i>If he had the foresight to bring gloves with him,</i>  how the hell's he gonna accidentally leave a print behind
label2 But it was in the victim's blood
label2 <i>Could have been one of the bystanders,</i>  <i>or a cop just reaches out, boom, false print.</i>  <i>Yeah, but that print disqualified 2,500 suspects.</i>  Which is why we also used handwriting
label2 But not for Rick Marshall
label2 <i>Decided it looked nothing like the Z letters, so they just moved on.</i>  How do they know that Rick Marshall wrote the sign
label2 My thoughts exactly
label2 He received code training
label2 He was also a projectionist at a silent film theater
label2 <i>Well, then, how do I get copies of Rick Marshall's handwriting?</i>  <i>Three ways
label2 One, get a warrant, which you can't.</i>  <i>Two, get him to volunteer, which he won't.</i>  <i>Yeah, and three?</i>  Get creative
label2 <i>I don't know what to tell you
label2 You get it, I'll analyze it.</i>  <i>Beyond that, you're on your own.</i>  <i>Okay, what about the guy who came to see you,</i>  the one who called me
label2 <i>You mean Wallace Penny?</i>  Yeah
label2 Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.</i>  <i>How did you find me?</i>  I need a sample of Rick Marshall's handwriting
label2 <i>I told you
label2 Vaughn is who...</i>  <i>Mr
label2 Penny, if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac,</i>  I need a sample of his handwriting to confirm it
label2 Can you help me or not
label2 <i>Rick used to draw movie posters for the theater Vaughn worked at.</i>  <i> I'll send one down
label2 Yeah, but is it...</i>  It's as close as I've ever seen
label2 We have to tread lightly here
label2 We're talking about implicating this man as the Zodiac
label2 I can get more
label2 <i>I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister.</i>  <i>I've been to the DMV, and I talked to her parents,</i>  <i>but still, nobody knows where to find her.</i>  <i>Mr
label2 Graysmith, most of the writing matches the exemplar.</i>  <i>In a way, though, it's the part that doesn't match that scares me the most.</i>  <i> What do you mean
label2 Toschi needs to call in on a landline.</i>  <i> Dispatch
label2 Hey
label2 Dave Toschi.</i>  <i>I'll connect you.</i>  <i> Dave
label2 Yeah
label2 What's up?</i>  <i>Jennings here from the Chronicle.</i>  It came in this morning and you need to see it right now
label2 See what
label2 <i>The new Zodiac letter
label2 All right, come on.</i>  Hall of Justice
label2 <i>Now
label2 Do you have it with you
label2 "This is the Zodiac speaking
label2 I'm back with you
label2 Who will play me
label2 "I'm now in control of all things. 
label2 These guys are from Internal Affairs
label2 We need to talk
label2 <i>Good evening
label2 Our top story tonight,</i>  <i>Good evening
label2 Our top story tonight,</i>  <i>the San Francisco Police Department has confirmed</i>  <i>that the man who calls himself the Zodiac</i>  <i>and terrorized the Bay Area has broken his silence of 51 months.</i>  <i>In a letter claiming, "I am back with you,"</i>  <i>the Zodiac makes no overt threats against the citizenry,</i>  <i>and muses that his life and times would make the best movie script yet.</i>  These carrots are perfect
label2 <i>The terse 66 word message also manages...</i>  Just go
label2 Are they targets?</i>  <i>Fine, but you have to come back</i>  and finish at least half of what's on that plate
label2 <i>More team coverage on the cipher slayer's return...</i>   Okay
label2 Okay
label2 David got a kick out of it  and so he wrote a couple of anonymous letters  asking for the character to be brought back
label2 <i>It was like writing fan mail to himself
label2 And I'm sure that this will all blow over.</i>  <i>Blow over?</i>  They kicked him out of Homicide
label2 They made him give his handwriting like some common criminal
label2 <i> May I talk to him
label2 No.</i>  <i>Okay, can you just ask him</i>  if he ever investigated a man named Rick Marshall
label2 Is that all you can think about
label2 <i>Mr
label2 We trust...</i>  <i>This girl, she wants music lessons?</i>  Dave
label2 Dave
label2 You stop calling my house
label2 Do you understand me
label2 I just need your help to find Linda
label2 <i> Jesus
label2 Look, two seconds.</i>  <i>Look, we've been running handwriting samples.</i>   Who's we
label2 Sherwood and I.  Sherwood
label2 Sherwood who drinks like Paul Avery now
label2 He retired
label2 Is that what he told you
label2 <i> What, are you saying he's wrong
label2 No, Robert.</i>  <i>No, I know you don't think it's him.</i>  <i>I mean, no, I am not having this conversation.</i>  <i>But I think that Marshall knew Darlene, and I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,</i>  so I'm gonna talk to Bob Vaughn
label2 <i> Robert
label2 What?</i>  <i>Okay, the Rick Marshalls of this world will suck you dry.</i>  They're blind alleys
label2 <i>But he said he wasn't gonna announce his murders anymore, Dave.</i>  He was just gonna do them
label2 Do you know what the chances of us arresting someone are now
label2 Too much of the evidence is lost.</i>  <i>People get old, Robert
label2 They forget.</i>  <i>Now, I have been a cop for 25 years
label2 Murder police for 12.</i>   What do you do for a living
label2 You know what I do for a living
label2 So what are you saying
label2 I am saying Zodiac was my job
label2 It is not yours
label2 <i> He's still out there, Dave
label2 No, Robert
label2 I am through with this.</i>  I am through with you
label2 <i>What about September 26, 1970?</i>  <i> Okay, which one was that
label2 Dad
label2 Mark that
label2 <i>Got another one
label2 June 19th, 1971.</i>  That's got to be near the summer solstice
label2 <i>Oh, guys.</i>  <i>Don't tell Mom about our special project, okay?</i>  How come you and Mom don't sleep in the same bed anymore
label2 Hello
label2 <i>Mr
label2 Thank you for calling me back.</i>  <i>Yeah
label2 How can I help?</i>  I called you because we've been crossreferencing lunar cycles  with the Zodiac's timeline
label2 <i>More often than not, each cycle since '69 corresponds with an attack</i>  <i>or with one of the letters, or an unsolved homicide.</i>  <i> Who's working with you on this
label2 Some colleagues.</i>  Dad
label2 <i> Ken, can you hold on one second
label2 Dad?</i>   What is it
label2 <i>In the decade since the Zodiac's last cipher was received,</i>  <i>every federal agency has taken a crack at decoding it.</i>  <i>But today, where those agencies had failed,</i>  <i>a cartoonist has succeeded.</i>  <i>How did you do it?</i>  <i>Oh, just a lot of books from the library, and I love puzzles, so I just...</i>  Yeah
label2 The fucking library
label2 <i>I believe that you can accomplish anything that you put your mind...</i>  That's a "J"
label2 Okay
label2 Thank you so much
label2 She's in jail
label2 Isn't that great?</i>  Why'd you do it
label2 Because she'll be able to identify Rick...   What are you talking about
label2 You went on TV
label2 You put yourself out there for him to see
label2 <i>Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.</i>  Then who's been calling our house in the middle of the night  at least once a week
label2 Nobody
label2 I have to go see Bob Vaughn
label2 <i>Well, that's too bad, because we're gonna talk about this.</i>  And when is it gonna be finished
label2 When you catch him
label2 When you arrest him
label2 Be serious
label2 I am serious
label2 I need to know who he is
label2 Is that more important than your family's safety
label2 Why
label2 Why do you need to do this
label2 Why
label2 Because nobody else will
label2 Are you done
label2 Can I go
label2 Mr. Vaughn
label2 Mr. Graysmith
label2 Hi
label2 You needed to speak to me
label2 Yes
label2 There's a coffee shop right on the corner
label2 <i> Why don't we just go to my home
label2 Oh, I don't wanna put you out.</i>  It's no trouble at all
label2 Where are you parked
label2 Just right there
label2 Oh
label2 Okay
label2 Watch your step
label2 Come in
label2 Oh, thank you.</i>  It's very rustic
label2 <i> Can I take your jacket
label2 This way, please.</i>   Have a seat
label2 Thank you
label2 Oh, no, I'm all right.</i>   You sure
label2 Yes
label2 I wanted to ask you about a film that the Avenue may have played  while you were the organist there
label2 <i>The Most Dangerous Game?</i>  <i>Oh, it's a classic
label2 RKO
label2 We've run that picture many times.</i>  <i>In '68, '69?</i>  I'd have to check my records
label2 Why
label2 Do you remember the Zodiac
label2 <i>This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?</i>  <i> He was a projectionist there, right
label2 <i>Okay
label2 Well, there is a connection</i>  between one of the Zodiac attacks and that film
label2 You mean the symbol
label2 The Zodiac symbol on film
label2 It's on the countdown
label2 <i>It's trimmed off each reel before it's shown,</i>  but it always arrives with it
label2 Right there
label2 <i>The first time I saw it in the papers, I thought about that.</i>  We got a tip  that Rick left a film canister here that he told you never to open
label2 Is it true
label2 Yes
label2 Did you open it
label2 No
label2 Rick took it back in 1972
label2 This tip is how you got it in your head that Rick is the Zodiac
label2 That and the poster
label2 The poster that Rick drew
label2 The handwriting is the closest that we have ever come to a match
label2 <i> Rick didn't draw any posters
label2 No, he drew this one.</i>  <i>Mr
label2 Graysmith, I do the posters myself.</i>  That's my handwriting
label2 Why don't I just go and find out when we played that film
label2 <i>Oh, that's all right.</i>  It's not a problem
label2 They're just down in the basement
label2 Not many people have basements in California
label2 <i>You coming, Mr. Graysmith?</i>  <i>The original studio onesheets, I always kept for myself.</i>  The cheapo knockoffs like you brought today  I end up tossing into the back alley
label2 '69
label2 You live alone
label2 <i>Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.</i>  <i>So, that would be about</i>  <i>nine weeks before the first Zodiac letter, correct?</i>  Yeah
label2 Do you think he saw the film in our theater and was inspired
label2 Are you sure there's nobody else in the house
label2 Would you like to go upstairs and check
label2 Thanks for everything
label2 You're welcome
label2 It's locked
label2 Thank you
label2 Got to be two killers
label2 One has the...  Guys
label2 You've got five minutes
label2 Linda
label2 <i>Hi, I'm Robert.</i>  Did you get my note
label2 What's this about
label2 Zodiac
label2 You got the look
label2 What look
label2 I didn't mean anything
label2 Tell me about this painting party
label2 <i>Darlene always had a lot of boys around,</i>  even though she was married
label2 <i>And this one guy was weird, though.</i>  He used to bring her presents from Tijuana and..
label2 She once told me he'd killed somebody
label2 Really
label2 <i>Yeah, I think maybe when he was in the service.</i>   Navy
label2 Was he into movies
label2 Was he a movie buff
label2 I can tell you that he was not into people
label2 <i>The party Darlene threw,</i>  <i>people were supposed to just show up and drink beer, help paint.</i>  <i>But this guy showed up in a suit,</i>  and just sat in a chair all by himself all night long
label2 Didn't talk to anyone
label2 She was scared of him
label2 <i>And a couple of weeks later, she was dead.</i>  I'm sorry
label2 Do you remember his name
label2 <i>I mean, it was short, like a nickname, like Stan.</i>  <i> Rick
label2 Yeah
label2 How can you be sure
label2 It was a long time ago
label2 Think hard
label2 It was Rick
label2 <i>No, it wasn't.</i>   It was Rick
label2 It was Rick Marshall
label2 No
label2 It wasn't Rick
label2 It was Leigh
label2 <i> Leigh
label2 Yeah, Leigh.</i>  <i> Leigh
label2 Yeah, Leigh.</i>  Sounds right
label2 Officer
label2 I need you to let me in
label2 8:00 a. M., when we're open.</i>  Sergeant
label2 Sergeant Mulanax
label2 <i>Sergeant, I just need to see one file!</i>  Just give me five minutes
label2 I know exactly where it is
label2 Please
label2 I shouldn't be talking to you
label2 Okay
label2 Here
label2 Here
label2 So what
label2 He knew her
label2 Linda said Leigh
label2 This is Leigh
label2 No
label2 It's nothing
label2 Dave Toschi...  Agrees with me
label2 Our investigation into this subject is over
label2 I'm sorry
label2 Hello
label2 Who's there
label2 Oh, I've been kind of busy.</i>  Yeah
label2 I can see that
label2 I tried to send you these
label2 <i>I called the Chron.</i>  <i>Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so...</i>  I heard
label2 When's the last time you ate something
label2 Nothing makes sense anymore
label2 <i> Did it ever
label2 Yeah, it did.</i>  <i>Robert, it was just the date that didn't end.</i>  You don't mean that
label2 The kids miss you
label2 Neither can I
label2 <i>So, do whatever you have to,</i>  but finish this
label2 Dave
label2 It's Robert
label2 Dave
label2 Is he actually here
label2 I'm gonna kill him
label2 I'm calling SFPD
label2 Where's my gun
label2 Dave
label2 Robert
label2 He made a mistake
label2 Get away from the window
label2 I'll meet you around front
label2 <i>No, you won't.</i>  <i> You have to hear this
label2 No, I don't, Robert!</i>  The birthday was the one time that he was weak
label2 The one time that he gave something away
label2 <i> Robert, I am calling the police
label2 He called the Bellis' house
label2 December '69
label2 Today's my birthday. 
label2 It was his birthday
label2 Arthur Leigh Allen was born on December 18th
label2 Get in here
label2 Here you go
label2 Thanks
label2 <i>He wrote me, you know?</i>  <i>2,500 suspects,</i>  the only one who ever wrote me a letter was Leigh Allen
label2 He sent me that when he got out
label2 And it's typewritten
label2 Using a typewriter is not a crime
label2 And he knew Darlene
label2 It's in the Vallejo files
label2 Mulanax said that he was your favorite suspect
label2 Sherwood disqualified his handwriting
label2 The same Sherwood that drinks like Paul Avery now
label2 <i>Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill in writing saying,</i>  <i>"I'm sorry, this just won't work
label2 "</i>   But you also have Terry Pascoe...  His protégé
label2 "Do not disqualify this suspect on the basis of handwriting. 
label2 <i> So the two cancel each other out
label2 No, they don't.</i>  It was Sherwood's case
label2 He was the head of Questioned Documents
label2 <i>If it went to trial,</i>  all the defense would have to do is call Sherwood to the stand
label2 <i>And there was no way of getting Allen into court in the first place,</i>  <i>because there was no evidence, Robert.</i>  <i>What do you mean, there's no evidence?</i>  You have him seen with the ciphers
label2 The same size shoes and gloves
label2 <i>The Most Dangerous Game
label2 The Zodiac watch.</i>  The background with school children
label2 The misspellings of Christmass
label2 All circumstantial
label2 <i>Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.</i>  We should have found one of those things in that trailer
label2 We didn't
label2 That's..
label2 Catherine Allen states that  "Leigh cleaned out his trailer on Friday after work  <i>"and moved it to Santa Rosa on Saturday, August 7th, 1971
label2 "</i>  You interviewed him at the refinery on August 4th
label2 So, he's cleaning out his trailer,</i>  he's moving into a different county 48 hours after you interviewed him
label2 <i>Okay
label2 Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.</i>  All right
label2 <i>Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen and the Zodiac, their timelines.</i>  <i> When was the first murder in Vallejo
label2 Christmas, 1968.</i>  <i>Eight months before that, Allen is fired for molesting his students</i>  and his family discovers that he's a pedophile
label2 <i> Now, when do the letters begin
label2 And they continue until you go to see him at work
label2 <i>Now, after that, do any of the letters contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?</i>  <i>No
label2 Because he dumped them, because he got scared.</i>  Because he knew that you were on to him
label2 <i> So, when's the next letter from Zodiac
label2 <i>Then, in '74, he feels comfortable again</i>  because everybody's moved off Allen as a suspect
label2 And what do we get
label2 <i>Three new letters from Zodiac in January, May, and July in '74.</i>   But then the letters stop
label2 What happens to Allen
label2 He's arrested
label2 <i> When is he released
label2 August, '77.</i>  <i>Allen gets out
label2 He types you an apology, and then what?</i>  We get our first new Zodiac letter in four years
label2 <i>Okay
label2 Yes
label2 <i>So, all coincidence aside, Robert,</i>  how can you be sure that Leigh Allen is the Leigh from this file
label2 <i>Now, Vallejo is a small town, but it's not that small.</i>  How do you put the two of them together
label2 <i>This is a case that's covered both Northern and Southern California,</i>  with victims and suspects spread over hundreds of miles
label2 Would you agree
label2 Yes
label2 Darlene Ferrin worked at the Vallejo House of Pancakes  on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll
label2 <i>Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.</i>  Is that true
label2 I've walked it
label2 So
label2 <i>The prints, the handwriting...</i>   I'm not asking you as a cop
label2 I can't prove this
label2 <i>Just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean it's not true.</i>  <i>Easy, Dirty Harry.</i>  Finish the book
label2 Thank you
label2 Thank you for breakfast
label2 Can I help you
label2 No
label2 Thanks for coming to see me
label2 You're the one I talked to on the phone
label2 I'm George Bawart
label2 Vallejo PD
label2 I took over for Jack Mulanax
label2 It's been 22 years
label2 <i>Well, this is just a formality.</i>  I'm gonna show you a group of photographs
label2 <i>Now, the person that shot you may or may not be</i>  among these photographs
label2 You don't have to pick anybody out  <i>just because I'm showing you these pictures, you understand?</i>  <i>Yes, sir, I do.</i>  All right
label2 <i>If you don't recognize anyone, that's okay.</i>  That's him
label2 How sure are you
label2 <i>Yeah, I'm pretty sure.</i>  He had a round face like this guy
label2 Wait
label2 <i>No, no
label2 Just that he had a round face like that.</i>  It's this man
label2 All right
label2 <i>Now, on a scale of one to 10, 10 being positive,</i>  how sure are you
label2 At least an eight
