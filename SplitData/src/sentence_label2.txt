Get down to the beach
There may be others
Now
Talk to me
Come on
Come on
Let's go
Let's go
Wait
Get goin', Frank
Get in there
Oh
Jesus Christ
Hell of a way to make a landing
How many
Don't know
Three
Maybe four
Hey, Frank
Can we hurry this up
It's gonna be 40 below in five minutes
All right, all right
Let's get it going
Keep it together
Come on
Right
Right
Here we go, Mr. Dillon
Give us strength, O Lord, to endure
We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry God
Let the circle be unbroken...  until the day
Amen
[ All ] Amen
Thank you, gentlemen
This is rumor control
Here are the facts
As some of you know,  a 337 model E.E.V....  crashlanded here at 0600...  on the morning watch
There was one survivor,  two dead and a droid that was hopelessly smashed beyond repair
The survivor is a woman
I just want to say that I've taken a vow of celibacy
That also includes women
Yes
We've all taken the vow!  
I'd like to say that I, for one,  do not appreciate company policy allowing her to freely...  intermingle with inmates and the rest of the staff
What brother means to say is we view the presence of any outsider,  especially a woman, as a violation of the harmony,  a potential break in the spiritual unity
We are well aware of your feelings in this matter
You will be pleased to know that I have requested a rescue team
Hopefully, they will be here inside of a week  Oh, come on
And evacuate her A.S.A.P
What's her medical status
She doesn't seem too badly damaged
She's unconscious
Can't give you a more specific diagnosis at the moment
Will she live
I would think so
Look
It's in everybody's interest...  the woman doesn't come out of the infirmary until the rescue team arrives
And certainly not without an escort, right
Sir
Gentlemen, we should all stick to our set routine...  and not get unduly agitated
Right
Correct
All right
Thank you, gentlemen
All right
there ain't gonna be much left
What's that
It's just a little cocktail of my own mix
Sort of eyeopener
You a doctor
My name is Clemens
I'm the chief medical officer here
Here
Fury 161
It's one of WeylandYutani's backwater work prisons,  it grieves me to say
Do you mind
This is basically a stabilizer
I really ought to shave your head
We have a big problem with lice here
And when you're feeling better, I'll give you some clippers,  and you can tend to your private parts yourself
How'd I get here
You crashlanded in an E.E.V
Evidently separated from your mother ship before you hit our atmosphere
You have any idea how long you were in hypersleep
'Cause coming out the way you did can be quite a jolt to the system
Yeah, I'll be sick for a couple of weeks
Indeed
Where are the others
They didn't make it
What
They didn't survive
I have to get to the ship
Have to get to the ship
You're in no condition for that
You want to get me some clothes, or should I just go like this
Given the nature of our indigenous population, I would suggest clothes
[ Clears Throat ]  None of them have seen a woman in years
Neither have I, for that matter
This used to be a 5,000 convict facility,  but it's been reduced to a custodial staff of 25
Why
Keep the pilot light on
The pilot light for what
Blast furnace
Natural methane
We have a foundry, Lieutenant Ripley
The inmates forge lead sheets for toxic waste containers
How do you know my name
It's stenciled on the back of your shorts
Where are the bodies
We have a morgue
We put them there until the investigative team arrives in about a week, I think
There was a droid
Disconnected
There were bits and pieces of him all over the place
We put what was left on the rubbish tip
The corporal was impaled by that safety support
He never knew what hit him
And the girl
She drowned in her cryotube
I don't think she was conscious when it happened
Um, I'm sorry
Where is she
In the morgue
I have to see her
I have to see what's left of her
Is there any particular reason that you're so insistent
Yes
I have to be sure how she died
I hate to be repetitious about such a sensitive subject,  but it is persectly clear that she drowned
Was she your daughter
No
She wasn't
Um  CCould I have a moment alone, please
Yes, of course
What's she doing
Okay
No
We have to do an autopsy
What
I told you,  we have to make sure how she died
And I told you, she drowned
I'm not so sure
II have to see inside of her
You're disorientated
Half your system's still in  I have a very, very good reason
Well, perhaps you'd like to share that reason
Possible contagion
What kind exactly
Cholera
Cholera
There hasn't been a case of cholera reported for 200 years
Please
Everything's in place
There's no sign of infection
No indication of disease
Chest
Open the chest
Careful
Lungs
Flooded with fluid
Ergo, she drowned
Now, since I'm not a complete idiot,  would you like to tell me what we're really looking for
Mr. Clemens
Superintendent
I don't believe you've met Lieutenant Ripley
What's going on, Mr. Clemens
That's right, sir
What's going on, Mr. Clemens
Well, first  the lieutenant is feeling much better, I'm happy to say
Second, in the interest of public health,  I am performing an autopsy
Without my authority
Well, there didn't seem to be time
But it's turned out all right
There's no sign of contagion in the body
Good
But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley didn't parade around in front of the prisoners,  as I am told she did in the last hour
It might also be helpful...  if you kept me informed as to any change in her physical status
Or would that be asking too much
We have to cremate the bodies
Nonsense
We'll keep the bodies on ice till the rescue team arrives
On ice
There is the public health issue
The lieutenant feels that there is still a possibility of a communicable infection
I thought you said there was no sign of disease
It would appear that the child drowned
But without the benefit of proper laboratory tests,  it's impossible to be absolutely certain
I would consider it unwise...  to tolerate even the possibility of an unwelcome virus
An outbreak of cholera would look extremely bad on a report
Would it not, sir
We've 25 prisoners in this facility
All doubleychromos
All thieves, rapists, murderers, child molesters
All scum
Just because they've taken on religion doesn't make them any less dangerous
I try not to offend their convictions
I don't want to upset the order
I don't want ripples in the water
And I don't want a woman walking around giving them ideas
I see
For my own personal safety
Exactly
I will leave the details of the cremation to you, Mr. Clemens
They may use the furnace, but I want everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours
You called it, sir
Ah, Christmas has come early, Murph
What do you mean
Any dead ox is a good ox
You're bloody right
Smelly bastards, all covered in lice
There's only seven of the friggin' things left, and then we're done with them
God, I hates hosin' these bastards down
I always get shite all over me boots
Talkin' of hosing things down, FrankYeah
You had the chance, what would you say to her
What do you mean, if I got the chance
You know
If you got the chance
You mean, casual like
Yeah
I mean, how would you put it to her if you bumped into her in the mess hall or somewhere
No problem
I've never had any problem with the ladies
I'd say to her, "Good day, my dear
How's it goin'
Anything I can do to be of service?
Then I'd give her the look, you knowup and down
[ Grunts ]  And I'd give her the wink, the dirty smile
She'd soon get the picture
Yeah, right
And then she'd say, "Kiss my ass, you horny old fucker!
I'd be happy to kiss her ass
I'd be happy to kiss her anywhere she wants
Yeah, but treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen
Right, Frank
Told you before, Murph
Treat a queen like a whore and a whore like a queen
Can't go wrong
What do you think killed Babe
Beats me
She just keeled over
How old was she
The charts say 1 1
In her prime
Never mind
We'll chop her up later and throw her in the stew
Right
Hey, Frank
What's this
"We commit this child...  "and this man to your keeping, O Lord
"Their bodies...  "have been taken from the shadow of our nights
"They have been released...  from all darkness and pain.
"The child and the man...  "have gone beyond our world
"They are forever eternal...  "and everlasting
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Why are the innocent punished
Why the sacrifice
Why the pain
There aren't any promises
Nothing's certain
Only that some get called, some get saved
She won't ever know the hardship and grief...  for those of us left behind
We commit these bodies to the void...  with a glad heart
For within each seed,  there is a promise of a flower
[ Gurgling ]  And within each death,  no matter how small,  there's always a new life
A new beginning
Amen
I'll tell you, it's fucking weird
The only one to survive that crash is a woman
What trouble can she cause
She's already changed everything
What the fuck are we supposed to do  I, for one  I mean it
Okay
There's a lot of talk going around that we've got some disharmony here
Any you guys want to tell me what the problem is
Come on
Speak to me, brothers
All right
I'll tell ya
I don't mind the dark
I don't mind the bugs
I don't mind wanderin' around in some cold, wet, damp tunnel for a week at a time
I don't mind anything
But I mind Golic
That the way you feel about it
Yeah
The guy's crazy and he smells bad
[ Snickering ]  I ain't going out with him anymore
You got anything to say for yourself
Well, he's going with you
Golic is just another poor, miserable, suffering son of a bitch, just like you and me
'Cept he smells worse
And he's crazy
Knock off the shit
You got a job to do
I don't want to hear another word about Golic
Okay
As I thought, Mr. Aaron
As I thought
You called it, sir
I just wanted to, uh, say thanks for what you said at the funeral
It was, uh  My friends would have appreciated it
Yeah, well, you don't wanna know me, lady
I'm a murderer and rapist of women
Really
Well, I guess I must make you nervous
Do you have any faith, sister
Not much
Well, we've got a lot of faith here
Enough even for you
I thought women weren't allowed
Well, we've never had any before,  but we tolerate anybody
Even the intolerable
Thank you
That's just a statement of principle
Nothing personal
You see, we've got a good place to wait here
And until now, no temptation
What are you waiting for
Huh
We're waiting for God to return...  and raise his servants to redemption
of the alternative people...  embraced religion, as it were, about five years ago
Tincture
[ Ripley ] I'm on medication
Hardly
What kind of religion
Some sort of apocalyptic, millenarian, Christian fundamentalist, uh  Right
Exactly
Point is, when the company wanted to close the facility down,  Dillon and the rest of the converts wanted to stay
And they were allowed to remain as custodians...  with two minders...  and a medical officer
And here we are
How did you get this wonderful assignment
How do you like your new haircut
It's okay
Now that I've gone out on a limb for you with Andrews,  damaged my already lessthanperfect relationship with that good man,  and briefed you...  on the humdrum history of Fury 1 61,  can you not tell me what you were looking for in the girl
You attracted to me
Ln what way
Ln that way
Very direct
I've been out here a long time
So have I.  ♪ In the year 751 0 ♪  ♪ If God's acomin' ♪  ♪ He oughta make it by then ♪  ♪ Maybe he'll look around and say ♪  ♪ Guess it's time for the Judgment♪  Yech

Spike
Spikey
Are you down there
What are you doing
I really appreciate your affections,  but I am aware that they... deflected my question
In the nicest possible way, of course
You're spoiling the mood
I have a job to do
I just want to know why we had to cremate the bodies
And now that I'm in your cot,  you think I owe you an answer
I think you owe me an answer
Being in my bed's got nothing to do with it
I had a terrible dream in hypersleep
And I had to be sure what killed her
Anyway, I made a mistake
Possibly
made another mistake
Really
What's that
Fraternizing with a prisoner
Physical contact
It's against the rules, isn't it
Definitely
When was this
L think you know
I'm not a prisoner
You have a bar code on the back of your head
That does deserve an explanation
But I don't think now is the moment
Sorry
We are rather spoiling things, aren't we
On Intercom ] Mr. Clemens
Mr. Aaron
Superintendent Andrews would like you to report...  to vent shaft 22 on the second quadrantnow
We've had an accident
Something serious
You could call it that
One of our prisoners has been... diced
Sorry
I have to go
Official duties
Who was it
Murphy
How do you know
That's his boot
I gave him the assignment, sir
He was a wanker
No apologies, Mr. Aaron
It wasn't your fault
Well, not much to say, is there
Death was instantaneous
No shit
I take it he was pulled into the fan
Sudden rush of air, I'd imagine, except  Right
Almost happened to me once
I've told him so many times, "Stay away from the fans.
Nobody bloody listens
Except the fan was blowing
What's that
I don't know
I want to see you in my quarters in 30 minutes, if you'll please, Mr. Clemens
Have you got any ideas
Here you are
You know, wandering around without an escort...  is really gonna piss Superintendent Andrews off
Will you tell me about your accident
One of the prisoners has been killed
Really
How
Hmm
In the air shaft
Poor soul backed into a ninefoot fan
I found something at the accident site,  just a bit away from where it happened
A mark
A burn
Rather like the one you found on the girl's cryotube
Look
I'm on your side
I want to help, but I need to know what's going on...  or what you think is going on
Lf you really wanna help,  find me a computer with audio capabilities...  so I can access this flight recorder
We don't have anything like that here
Bishop
The droid that crashed with me
I can point you in the right direction
I can't join you
I have a previous engagement
This'll top you up
Golic, don't fidget
What's all this shit
It's not properly wrapped
What the hell does he ever do right
Eat
He's got that down pretty good
Golic
You light a candle for Murphy
I'll light a thousand
Never complained about me once
I loved him
Is it true what they say
His head split into a million pieces
Sit down, Mr. Clemens
Thank you
Sugar
Uh, no thanks
Milk
Just a little, please
Thank you, Mr. Aaron
Listen to me, you piece of shit
You screw with me one more time, I'll cut you in half
I'm sorry
I don't think I understand
At 0700 hours, I received word from the network
I may point out this is the first highlevel communication...  this installation has ever received, to my knowledge
They want this woman looked after
They consider her to be very high priority
Why
L have no idea
But why did you let her out of the infirmary
This accident with Murphy is what happens...  when one of these dumb sons of a bitches walks around with a hardon
I'm a doctor
You're the jailer
We both know exactly what you are
Sit down
I think it might be better if I left
I find you... unpleasant to be around
You do
Isn't that lovely
Consider this, Mr. Clemens
How would you like me to explain your sordid history...  to your newfound friend
For her personal edification, of course
Now sit the hell down
I don't like you
You're unpredictable
Insolent
Possibly dangerous
You question everything
If I didn't need a medical officer,  I wouldn't let you within light years of this operation
I'm eternally grateful
Keep your sarcasms to yourself
Now, is there anything I should know
About what
About the woman
Don't play with me, Mr. Clemens
You spend every second you can with her
And I have my suspicions not all of your concerns with her are medical
Has she said anything to youanything about where she's from, what her mission is
What the hell she was doing in an E.E.V.
She told me she was part of a combat unit that came to grief
Beyond that, I assume it's all classified
I haven't pressed her for more
That's all
That's all
You're sure
Yes
Nothing more
No
Get out of here
[ Screams ]  Shut up, you fuckin' bitch
Get in there
Shut up, you bitch
Nobody's gonna hear you
Goddamn it, let go of me
Fuck you
No
Hold still
Shh
Shh
No
Goddamn it
You okay
No
Son of a bitch
Take off
I gotta reeducate some of the brothers
We've gotta discuss some matters of the spirit
Cigarettes
So let's do it
This is like 1 0 city blocks
How many
This makes 1 76
Can't you chew a little quieter
I'm trying to figure out how big this compartment is
I can't think with all this goddamn noise you're making
You're not supposed to swear
I'm sorry
Now, we've encircled this entire compartment once  Hey
What
What the shit is doing that
Swearing
Shut up
It's all right to say "shit.
It ain't against God
What the hell is going on with the candles
Must be the wind from one of the vent shafts
Backwash from the closest circulating unit
But if all the candles go out, how the hell we gonna know where we are
Somebody will just have to go back and relight them
I guess I'm nominated
Watch your step, brother
Okay, who are the comedians
Wait, wait, wait
Quick, grab it
Here
Help me
Help me
Go
Fuckin' go
Go, go, go
Quick
Run
Gimme that
Get this fucking thing off me
Oh, fuck
Let me go
Ah, Ripley
Hi, Bishop
How you feeling
My legs hurt
Uh, listen, I'm sorry
It's okay
I'm just a glorified toaster
How are you
I like your new haircut
Bishop, can you access data on the flight recorder
No problem
Golic
I'm home
What happened on the Sulaco
Why were our cryotubes ejected
Stasis interrupted
Fire in cryogenic compartment
Repeat
Fire in cryogenic What happened
What started the fire, Bishop
Can you hear me
The fire was electrical
Lt was in the subflooring
Did the sensors pick up anything moving around on the ship prior to separation
It's very dark here, Ripley
I'm not what I used to be
Just tell me
Does the recorder indicate anything
Was there an alien on board
Yes
Is it on the Sulaco or did it come with us on the E.E.V.
It was with us all the way
Does the company know
The company knows everything that happened on the ship
It all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network
And they want it
I hurt
Do me a favor
Disconnect me
I could be reworked, but I'll never be top of the line again
I'd rather be nothing
You're sure
Do it for me, Ripley
It wasn't me
I didn't do it
It wasIt was the dragon
Feeds on minds
It was  Nobody can stop it
What about Boggs and Rains
They got sslaughtered like pigs
It wasn't me
It wasn't me
Stark raving mad
I'm not saying it was anyone's fault, but he should have been chained up
You called it, sir
Mad as a fucking hatter
Keep him separated from the rest
I don't want him causing a panic
Clemens, sedate this poor idiot
Yeah
Not until we know about the brothers
Now, now
Pull yourself together
Talk to me now
Now, where are Boggs and Rains
It wasn't me
gonna get anything out of him
It wasn't me
We'll have to send out a search team
I'm afraid we'll have to assume there's a very good chance...  this simple bastard has murdered them
Now, you don't know that
He's never lied to me
He's crazy, he's a fool, but he's not a liar
He's telling the truth
I'd like to talk to him about thisthis dragon
It was a dragon
[ Andrews ] You're not talking to anyone, Lieutenant
I'm not interested in your opinion,  because you are not in full possession of the facts
This man is a convicted multiple murderer, known for particularly brutal crimes
Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon
Yeah
That part's right
Then I'll talk to you
lt's important
When I have finished with my official duties,  I will be quite pleased to have a little chat, yes
Let me see if I have this correct, Lieutenant
It's an eightfoot creature of some kind,  with acid for blood, and it arrived on your spaceship
It kills on sight and is generally unpleasant
And, of course, you expect me to accept all this on your word
No, I don't expect anything
Quite a story, Mr. Aaron
Right, sir
It's a beauty
Never heard anything quite like it, sir
Expect not
Tell me, Lieutenant, what would you suggest we do
Well, what kind of weapons have you got
This is a prison
It's not a good idea to allow prisoners access to firearms
What keeps them from killing you
Fear
There's no way to escape
With the arrival of the next supply ship, the company would eliminate them
This is a maximum security prison,  and you have no weapons of any kind
We have some carving knives in the abattoir
A few more in the mess hall
Some fire axes scattered about the place
Nothing terribly formidable
That's all
We're on the honor system
Then we're fucked
No, you're fucked
Confined to the infirmary
Quarantined
Mr. Aaron will escort you
I think you'll be safe from any large, nasty beast while you're there, right
Yes, that's a good girl
all report to the mess hall
Superintendent Andrews wants a meeting
Mess hall, right away, people
Isn't there any way off of this place
Some way to escape
No
Supply ship comes every six months
And that's it
Mmhmm
Fuck
They are sending somebody to pick you up quite soon, I gather
Really
[ Coughs ] What's "soon"
I don't know
Nobody's ever been in a hurry to get here before
Do you want to tell me what you and Andrews talked about
No
You'll just say I'm crazy
That's a bit uncharitable
[ Inhales, Coughing ]  How are you feeling
Sore throat
Sick to my stomach
Pissed off
Well, that's understandable given the circumstances
Perhaps I should give you one of my special cocktails
blames everybody for everything
Nobody's persect, only human
There's no such thing as a perfect human
In an insane world,  a sane man...  must... appear... insane
That's very profound, Golic
Thank you
You married
Me
You should get married, have kids
Pretty girl
I used to know lots of 'em back home
They used to like me
For a while
You're gonna die too
Are you
What
Married
Just curious
No
How about leveling with me
Could you be more specific
When I asked how you got assigned here, you avoided the question
And then when I asked about the prison I.D
tattooed on the back of your head,  you ducked me again
Lt's a long, sad story...  and more than a little melodramatic
Try me
If you insist
After my student years,  despite the fact that I had become...  secretly addicted to morphine,  I was considered to be most promising,  a man with a future
And during my first residency, I did a 36hour stretch on an E.R
So, I went out and I got more than a little drunk
Then I got called back
Boiler had blown on a fuel plant,  and there were 30 casualties
And 1 1 of them died
Not as a result of the accident...  but because I prescribed the wrong dosage of painkiller
I got seven years in prison and my license reduced to a 3C
At least I got off the morphine
L'm sorry
L think I was let off lightly
Did you serve your time here
I got to know this motley crew quite well
So when they stayed, I stayed
Nobody else would employ me
So, do you still trust me with a needle
Magnificent
Give us strength, O Lord, to endure
We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry God
Let the circle be unbroken until the day
Amen
the fuck is happening here
What the fuck is this bullshit that's comin' down
We got murder
We got rape
We got brothers in trouble
I don't want no more bullshit around here
Now, we got problems, we stand together
Yes
Thank you, Mr. Dillon
All right
Once again, this is rumor control
Here are the facts
At 0800 hours, prisoner Murphy,  through carelessness on his part,  was found dead in vent shaft 1 7
He seems to have been sucked into a ventilator fan
At about 21 00 hours,  prisoner Golic reappeared in a deranged state
Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing
There seems to be a good chance that they have met with foul play...  at the hands of prisoner Golic
We need to organize and send out a search party
Volunteers will be appreciated
I think it's fair to say that our smoothly running facility...  has suddenly developed a few problems
I can only hope we are able to all pull together over the next few days...  until the rescue team arrives for Lieutenant Ripley
Lt's here
It got Clemens
Stop this raving at once
Stop it
I'm telling you, it's here
Aaron, get that foolish woman back to the infirmary
[ Screams ]  [ All Shouting ]   Out of my way
Fuck
We give you thanks, O Lord
Your wrath has come, and the time is near for us to be judged
The apocalypse is upon us
Let us be ready
Let your mercy be just
It was massive
Amen
And fast
L was there
I saw it
What the fuck do we do now
Who's in fucking charge
Organize
We gotta organize, right
Right
Well, I guess I'm next in line
85's gonna be in charge
Jesus, give us a break
Don't call me that
no way I can replace Andrews
He was a good man
I know you guys didn't appreciate him
Aaron, we don't want to hear that shit now
Hey, sister, what about you
You're an officer
How about showing us a little leadership
Forget fucking Shirley Temple
You take charge
Right
You run things here anyway
No fuckin' way
I'm not the officer type
I just take care of my own
Well, what does this fucking beast want
Is this mother gonna try for us all
Yeah
Well, ain't that sweet
So how are we gonna stop it
[ Clears Throat ]   We have no weapons
Is that correct
Right
I haven't seen one exactly like this before
Moves differently
But the others were afraid of fire  not much else
Can we seal off this area
No chance
The installation's 1 0 miles square
There's 600 air ducts running to the surface
What about video
I see these closedcircuit monitors everywhere
We could try to find it that way
The video system hasn't worked in years
Nothing much works here
We got a lot of technology, no way to fix it
What 85 is trying to tell you is  Don't call me that
We ain't got no entertainment center, no climate control,  no video system, no surveillance,  no freezers, no fucking ice cream,  no rubbers, no women, no guns
All we got here is shit
Oh, what the hell are we even talking to her for
She's the one that brought the fucker
Why don't we just get her head and shove it through the fucking wall
That sounds good to me
Why don't you shut the fuck up
Hmm
Right
Right
What are we going to do
What's this
Um,  that leads from the mess hall to the infirmary
It's a ventilation shaft
Then we go in there, flush it out
Hey
Hey, look, there's miles and miles of tunnel through there
It won't go far
It'll nest in this area
Right around...  here
How do you know that
It's like a lion
It sticks close to the zebras
Zebras
Oh, right
But, look
Running around down here in the darkAre you kidding
Once you get out of this main shaft, there's no overheads
Don't we have flashlights
We got thousands of 'em, but no batteries
I told you, nothing works
Torches
Do we have the capacity to make fire
Most humans have enjoyed that privilege since the Stone Age
No need to be sarcastic
Never been used
They were gonna dump a lot of nuclear crap in there
Never got around to it
It's clean as a whistle inside
This the only way in or out
That's right
Walls are six feet thick, solid steel
Really knew how to build these babies
You're saying we get something in there,  there's no way it can get out
That's right
No fucking way
This is where we keep it
I forget what the stuff's called
Quinitricetyline
L knew that
Right
I've got to get these section arrangements organized with Dillon...  for the paintbrush, uh  So, um David
Yeah
You can get these drums organized
Right, 85
And, uh, don't call me that
What's this "85" thing
Couple of us sneaked a look at his personnel file the day he arrived
Lt's his I.Q
I saw a drum of this stuff...  fall into a beachhead bunker once
The blast put a tug in dry dock for 1 7 weeks
Great stuff
All right
Let me get this straight
You want to burn it down and out of the pipes,  force it in here, slam the door...  and trap its ass
Right
And you want help from us ychromo boys, huh
You got something better to do
Why should we put our ass on the line for you
Your ass is already on the line
The only question is...  what are you gonna do about it
Look at this
There's only one of these fucking batteries in 2,000 that works
Hey, it could have been a lot worse
Yeah
We might have got the paintbrush detail
Man, this stuff stinks
This shit smells awful
Then don't breathe the fucking fumes
I'm in a fucking pipe with it
How can I keep from breathing it
I mean, don't breathe too hard
You'll get high
That's good for me
So you miss Doc, right
What makes you say that
I thought you two got real close
I guess you've been looking through some keyholes
That's what I thought
Oh
You okay
Yeah
l'm fine
Whatever you say, but, uh, you don't look okay to me, sister
L'm fine
I hate this place
I hate this place
Well
There's definitely something in here with us
Okay
Don't light the fire until I give the signal
This is the signal
Got it
Can you remember that
Buh  Wait for the fucking signal
Get down
Aaah
Come on, come on
We gotta find the sprinklers

I've got a job
Look, uh  Figure the rescue team gets here in four, five days  six, tops
They open the door, go in there with smart guns and kill it
What have you heard from them
Nothing much
We got a message received
Later, we got something that said you were top priority
They don't cut us in on much
We're the ass end of the totem pole out here
What if they don't want to kill it
Take it back
Yeah
They're not lunatics, you know
Gotta kill it
Right
Morse, please, cut me loose
No fucking way
Come on, man
It hurts
Oh, sorry
Come on
I haven't done nothing
Just don't talk to me
Please, what did I do
Please
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna sit here and guard your ass like l'm supposed to
I don't need any fucking trouble with Dillon
All I did was tell 'em about the dragon, what it did to Boggs and Rains
I didn't lie
You saw it

Oh, please
If this gets in here, I'm dead
I can't run

So where they got it
[ Chuckles ] In the waste tank
I mean, tight
Gotta see it again
What the fuck you talking about
No more cigarettes for you
Right
We got the first part
Now what do we say
Tell them we trapped it
What do we call it
A xenomorph
Right
How do you spell it
Here
Hey, wait a minute
We can't kill it
We don't have any weapons, right
Right
See
That's all they ever tell us

You just said the company's coming for it
That's right
They wanna take it back
Some sort of weapon
Yeah, what's wrong with that
They can't control it

All right
Now shut up, both of you
Shut up
Well, I'm out of ideas
Oh, surprise me
What about outside
Great idea
Sun don't come up for another two days
It's 40 below zero
The rescue team's 1 0 hours away
So that makes a lot of sense
Wonderful
You just want us to stay here and let this thing have us for lunch
I want you to get everybody that's still left together
Get 'em into the assembly hall
Okay
Where'd she go
Need any help
[ Exhales ]  I don't mean to scare you
You shouldn't be wandering around alone
Do me a favor and run this keyboard, will you
Okay
What do I do
Hit "B" or "C."  What's "C"
"Display biofunctions.
That's it
Okay, we're hot
Now what
Let it run a cycle
Hit "enhancement.
Keep looking
I don't know how to read this stuff
Hemorrhaging will show as a dark patch
hairline fractures through the base of the skull
Little white lines
What is it
I think you've got one inside of you
That's not possible
What does it look like
Horrible
I have to see it
Freeze it
You don't want to look at it
Freeze it
l'm sorry
All right
The fucking thing is loose
It's out there
A rescue team is on its way with guns and shit
Right now there isn't any place that's real safe
But we stay here, in the assembly hall
This place never had any fucking air conditioning
If it comes in, it's gotta be through one of these doors
Now we post a guard to let us know if it's coming
In the meantime, you lay low, be ready and stay right...  in case your time comes
Don't you start bullshitting, Dillon
We're gonna be trapped in here like rats
You got a weapon
You got a blade
Then you take it out and you fucking use it
Oh, right
So you think we're gonna stab this mothersucker to death
No, I don't think shit
Maybe
Maybe you'll hurt it before it takes you out, huh
Isn't that something
Any of you got any better ideas
And I'll tell you, until the rescue team gets here, we're fucked
So you better get prepared
Well, I ain't staying here
Well, then, suit yourself

Yeah
Let's make it to the furnace
Holy shit
Well, all right

Tell them the whole place has gone toxic
Are you kidding
Then they won't come here
The rescue team will turn back
Yeah
I know
What are you talking about
Our only hope is that they kill this fucker
And maybe they can do something for you
I don't know, freeze you  They can do an operation
They've got the technology
If this organism gets off the planet, it'll kill everything

They just want it for their bioweapons division, okay
So we can't let them come here

Understand
I think you're okay
Ah
Thanks
Have you got any ideas
[ Exhales ]  It won't kill me
I'm carrying the new queen
It won't kill its future
You really wanna bet this thing's that smart
Maybe I'll go find it
See how smart it is
You're gonna go and look for it
Yeah
I have a pretty good idea of where it is
It's just down there... in the basement
This whole place is a basement
It's a metaphor
Wanna come
Where are you when I need you
Don't be afraid
L'm part of the family
You've been in my life so long,  I can't remember anything else
Now do something for me
It's easy
Just  Just do what you do
Oh
It won't kill me
What are you doing out here
You're supposed to be laying low
I have one inside of me
Big one won't kill its own
What are you talking about
I just saw it,  an hour ago
I stood right next to it
I could've been lunch, but it wouldn't touch me
It ran away
It knows I'm carrying its future
Aw, bullshit
How do you know that thing's inside you
I saw it... on the CAT scan
It's a queenan egg layer
It can make thousands more like the one we've got here
Still sounds like bullshit to me
If that thing's inside you, how'd it get there
When I was in hypersleep, I guess
L was violated
Now I get to be the mother
I don't have much time,  and I can't do what I should
I need you to help me
I need you to kill me
What the fuck are you talking about
I'm dead anyway
I can't survive it
But the one inside of me can generate thousands more,  can wipe out the whole universe
Lt has to die
So somebody's gotta kill me
Are you up to it
You don't have to worry about that
No speeches
No prayers
What's going on
I don't like losing a fight
Not to nobody, not to nothing
Fuck
That damn thing out there has already killed half my men,  got the other half scared shitless
As long as it's alive, sister, you're not gonna save any universe
You said you were gonna kill me
You fucking coward
I want that thing
I want to get this thing, and I need you to do it
And if it won't kill you, then maybe that helps us fight it
Otherwise, fuck you
Go kill yourself
We waste this thing,  then you take care of me
No problem
Quick, easy and painless
This is the choice
You die sitting here on your ass, or you die out there
At least we take a shot
We owe it one
It's fucked us up
Maybe we can get even for the others
Now how do you want it
What the fuck are you talking about
I'm talkin' about killing that big motherfucker
Hold it, hold it
The rescue team's on its way
We could just sit this out
[ Ripley ] Rescue team for whom
For us
They just want the beast
You know that
I don't give a damn what they want
They're not gonna pick us off one by one, are they
I wouldn't be so sure
Come on
They're gonna take us home
They're not gonna take us home
we should go out and fight it
Jesus Christ
Give us a break
You guys have got to be fucking nuts
Look, I've got a wife and a kid
Nobody gives a shit about you, 85
You're not one of us
You're not a believer
You're a fucking company man
Yeah, okay
Okay, I'm a company man and not a fucking criminal
You keep telling me how dumb I am
Well, I'm smart enough not to have a life sentence on this rock
Fuck you
Piss off, 85
Yeah, and I'm smart enough to wait for some firepower to show up before we fight this thing
Right, Morse
Right
Okay
Just sit here on your asses
Fine
How about if I sit here on my ass
No problem
Oh, I forgot
You're the guy that's made a deal with God...  to live forever, huh
And all the rest of you pussies can sit it out too
Me and her'll do all the fighting
Okay
But I want the same thing as you
I want to see it dead
I hate the fucker
It killed my mates too
Why the fuck can't we wait for the company and have some guns on our side
Why do we have to go on some fucking suicide run
Right
Because they won't kill it
They might kill you just for having seen it
But they're not gonna kill it
That is crazy
That is horseshit
They will not kill us
When they first heard about this thing,  it was "crew expendable.
The next time they sent in marines
They were expendable too
What makes you think they're gonna care about a bunch of lifers...  who found God at the ass end of space
You really think they're going to let you...  interfere with their plans for this thing
They think we'rewe're crud
And they don't give a fuck about one friend of yours...  that'sthat's died
Not one
Have you got some sort of plan
This is a lead works, isn't it
All we got to do is lure the fucking beast into the mold,  drown it in hot lead
All right
So how do we do that
Yeah
What are we gonna use for bait
Oh, fuck
We're all gonna die
The only question is when
This is as good a place as any...  to take your first steps to heaven
Only question is how you check out
Do you want it on your feet...  or on your fucking knees, begging
I ain't much for begging
Nobody ever gave me nothin'
So I say fuck that thing
Let's fight it
Fuck it
Let's go for it
Let's kick its fucking ass
What if it runs at us
That's a fucking good idea
Channel "A," Door 1 open
When was the last time you used this place
We fired it up five, six years ago
You sure the piston's gonna work
There's nothing for sure in this place
We trap it here first, then you pull the lever, start the piston
Then the piston's gonna push the mothersucker right into the mold
Then one of the guys will pour the lead
End of his ass
End of story
What if somebody screws it up
We're fucked
You got one chance
One shot at it
That's all
We'll never have time to reset it
Now remember, when you pull the lever,  for a few seconds you're gonna be trapped in here with that fuckin' thing
If you guys don't drop the ball, I won't
Well, you just better be right about that thing not wanting you
Because if it wants out, that's how it's gonna go
Through that alcove, through you
Where are you gonna be
I'll be around
What about the others
Where are they
Praying
You believe in this heaven shit
Eh
I don't know
Me neither
Fuck it, though
What else have we got to believe in
Say that for fucking sure
WellHey
What the fuck, right

I just felt it move
You know who I am
You're a droid
Same model as Bishop
Sent by the fucking company
No
I'm not the Bishop android
I designed it
I'm very human
The company sent me here to show you a friendly face,  to demonstrate how important you are to us,  to me
You just want to take it back
We want to kill it and take you home
Bullshit
You're wrong
We want to help
What does that mean
We're gonna take that out of you
And keep it
Can't allow it to live
Everything we know would be in jeopardy
You don't want to take it back

Come with me
It's very quick
Painless

You'll be out for two hours

<i>That old thing, how you always hurt the one you love.</i>  <i>Well, it works both ways.</i>  <i>We have frontrow seats for this theater of mass destruction.</i>  <i>The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem</i>  <i>wrapped the foundations of 12 buildings with explosives.</i>  <i>In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges</i>  <i>and a few blocks will be reduced to smouldering rubble.</i>  <i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>  Two and a half
Think of everything we've accomplished
<i>Suddenly I realize that all of this, the gun, the bombs, the revolution,</i>  <i>has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>  <i>Bob
Bob had bitch tits.</i>  <i>This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.</i>  <i>The big moosie slobbering all over me, that was Bob.</i>  We're still men
Yes, we're men
Men is what we are
<i>Bob had had his testicles removed

You wanna see pain
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights
See the guys with testicular cancer
That's pain
I always wanted three kids... two boys and a girl
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy
We never could agree on anything
Well, I... She...  She had her first child last week
A girl
With... With her... With her new husband
Fuck
Thank God, you know..
I'm glad for her
She deserves...  Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us
Thank you, Thomas
I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage
And that gives me strength
We give each other strength
It's time for the oneonones
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example and really open ourselves up
Could you find a partner
<i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>  <i>His eyes already shrinkwrapped in tears.</i>  <i>Knees together
Those awkward little steps.</i>   My name is Bob
Bob
<i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>  <i>You know that chest expansion programme on latenight TV?</i>  <i>That was his idea.</i>  I was a juicer
You know, using steroids
Diabonal and  Wisterol
Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Christ sakes
And now I'm bankrupt
I'm divorced
My two grown kids  won't even return my phone calls
<i>Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>  Go ahead,... Cornelius
You can cry
<i>And then... something happened
I let go.</i>  That's really good
<i>Lost in oblivion.</i>  <i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>  <i>I found freedom
Losing all hope was freedom.</i>  It's OK.  <i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>  <i>I became addicted.</i>  If I didn't say anything  people always assumed the worst
They cried harder... then I cried harder
Now we're going to open the green door, the heart chakra...  <i>I wasn't really dying.</i>  <i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>  <i>I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.</i>  Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light
It moves over your body, healing you
Now keep this going
Remember to breathe  and step forward through the back door of the room
Where does it lead
To your cave
Step forward  into your cave
That's right
You're going deeper into your cave
And you're going to find  your power animal
Slide
<i>Every evening I died.</i>  <i>And every evening I was born again.</i>  <i>Resurrected.</i>  <i>Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too.</i>  <i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i>  <i>ready to cry.</i>  <i>This was my vacation.</i>  <i>And she</i>  <i>ruined everything.</i>  This is cancer, right
<i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i>  <i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>  <i>She was a liar.</i>  <i>She had no diseases at all.</i>  <i>I had seen her at Free And Clear, my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>  <i>Then at Hope, my bimonthly sicklecell circle.</i>  <i>And again, at Seize The Day, my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>  <i>Marla,</i>  <i>the big tourist.</i>  <i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>  <i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>  <i>I couldn't cry
So once again,</i>  <i>I couldn't sleep.</i>  <i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>  <i>after we open our heart chakras, when it's time to hug,</i>  <i>I'm gonna grab that bitch, Marla Singer, and scream.</i>  Marla, you liar
You big tourist, I need this
Now, get out
<i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>  <i>We'll just let that dry...</i>  <i>When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep.</i>  <i>And you're never really awake.</i>  To begin tonight's communion,  Chloe would like to say a few words
<i>Oh, yeah
Chloe.</i>  <i>Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton would look if you made it walk around</i>  <i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>  Well, I'm still here
But I don't know for how long
That's as much certainty as anyone can give me
But I've got some good news
I no longer have any fear of death
But..
I am in a pretty lonely place
Noone will have sex with me
I'm so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time
I have pornographic movies in my apartment,   and lubricants and amyl nitrite
Thank you, Chloe
Everyone, let's thank Chloe
Thank you, Chloe
Now, let's ready ourselves for guided meditation
You're standing at the entrance of your cave
You step inside your cave and you walk...  <i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>  <i>Marla.</i>  <i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.</i>  <i>But you can't.</i>  <i>..deeper into your cave as you walk.</i>  <i>You feel a healing energy all around you.</i>  <i>Now find your power animal.</i>  Slide
OK. Let's partner up
Pick someone special to you tonight
Hey
We need to talk
Sure
I'm onto you
What
Yeah
You're a faker
You're not dying
Sorry
In the Tibetanphilosophy, SylviaPlath sense of the word, I know we're all dying
But you're not dying the way Chloe is
So
So you're a tourist
I've seen you
I saw you at melanoma, I saw you at tuberculosis
I saw you at testicular cancer
I saw you practising this
Practising what
Telling me off
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert
I'll expose you
Go ahead
I'll expose you
Come together
Let yourselves cry
Oh, God
Why are you doing this
It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee
Look, this is important
These are my groups
I've been coming for over a year
Why do you do it
I don't know
When people think you're dying, they listen to you instead of..
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak
Yeah
Yeah
Share yourself... completely
Look, you don't want to get into this
It becomes an addiction
Really
I'm not kidding
I can't cry if another faker is present, and I need this
You gotta find somewhere else to go
Candystripe a cancer ward
It's not my problem
No, wait a second
Hold on
We'll split up the week, OK
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis
You take tuberculosis
My smoking doesn't go over at all
OK. Good
Fine
Testicular cancer should be no contest
Technically, I have more right to be there
You still have your balls
You're kidding
I dunno
Am I
No
No
What do you want
I'll take the parasites
You can't have both
Take the blood parasites
I want brain parasites
I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia
I want that
You can't have the whole brain
So far, you have four
I only have two
OK. Take both the parasites
They're yours
Now we both have three...  Hey
You left half your clothes
What, are you selling those
Yes
I'm selling some clothes
So
We each have three
That's six
What about the seventh day
I want bowel cancer
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>  No
No
I want bowel cancer
That's your favorite too
Tried to slip it by me, eh
Look, we'll split it
Take the first and third Sunday
Deal
Looks like this is goodbye
Let's not make a big thing out of it
How's this for not making a big thing
Hey, Marla
Marla
Maybe we should exchange numbers
Should we
We might wanna switch nights
OK.  <i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>  <i>Marla's philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.</i>  <i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>  It doesn't have your name
Who are you
Cornelius
Rupert
Travis
Any of the stupid names you give each night
<i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>  <i>SFO
LAX.</i>  <i>You wake up at O'Hare.</i>  <i>Dallas Fort Worth.</i>  <i>BWI.</i>  <i>Pacific
Mountain
Central
Lose an hour
Gain an hour.</i>  The checkin for that flight isn't for another two hours, sir
<i>This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>  <i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>  <i>If you wake up at a different time, in a different place,</i>  <i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>  <i>Everywhere I travel,</i>  <i>tiny life.</i>  <i>Singleserving sugar and cream.</i>  <i>Single pat of butter.</i>  <i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>  <i>Shampooconditioner combos.</i>  <i>Samplepackage mouthwash
Tiny bars of soap.</i>  <i>The people I meet on each flight,</i>  <i>they're singleserving friends.</i>  <i>Between takeoff and landing, we have our time together.</i>  <i>That's all we get.</i>  <i>Welcome!</i>  <i>On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>  <i>I was a recall coordinator
My job was to apply the formula.</i>  The infant went through the windshield
<i>A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>  <i>The rear differential locks up.</i>  The teenager's braces are stuck to the ashtray
Might make a good antismoking ad
<i>The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.</i>  <i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>  The father must have been huge
See where the fat burned to the seat
The polyester shirt
Very modern art
<i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>  <i>Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.</i>  <i>Multiply the result by the average outofcourt settlement, C.</i>  <i>A x B x C</i>  equals X
If X is less than the cost of a recall,  we don't do one
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents
You wouldn't believe
Which car company do you work for
A major one
<i>Every time the plane banked too sharply on takeoff or landing,</i>  <i>I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.</i>  <i>Anything.</i>  <i>Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.</i>  "If you are seated in an emergency exit row  and would be unable or unwilling to perform the duties  listed on the safety card, please ask a flight attendant to reseat you.
It's a lot of responsibility
Wanna switch seats
No
I'm not sure I'm the man for that particularjob
An exitdoor procedure at 30,000ft
The illusion of safety
Yeah
I guess so
You know why they put oxygen masks on planes
So you can breathe
Oxygen gets you high
In a catastrophic emergency, you take giant panic breaths
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile
You accept your fate
It's all right here
Emergency water landing, 600mph
Blank faces
Calm as Hindu cows
That's...  That's an interesting theory
What do you do
What do you mean
What do you do for a living
Why
So you can pretend you're interested
OK.  You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh
We have the exact same briefcase
Soap
Sorry
I make and I sell soap
The yardstick of civilization
<i>And this is how I met...</i>  Tyler Durden
Did you know if you mix gasoline and frozen orange juice, you can make napalm
No, I did not
Is that true
That's right
One can make all kinds of explosives with simple household items
Really
If one was so inclined
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting singleserving friend I have ever met
Everything on a plane is singleserving...  Oh, I get it
Very clever
Thank you
How's it working out for you
What
Being clever
Great
Keep it up, then
Right up
A question of etiquette
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>  <i>Airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.</i>   Was it ticking
Throwers know modern bombs don't tick
Sorry, throwers
Baggage handlers
But when a suitcase vibrates,  the throwers have got to call the police
My suitcase was vibrating
Nine times out of ten  it's an electric razor
But... every once in a while  it's a dildo
It's company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo
<i>We have to use the indefinite article, a dildo, never</i>  <i>your dildo.</i>  I don't own...  <i>I had everything in that suitcase
My CK shirts.</i>  <i>My DKNYshoes
My AX ties.</i>  <i>Never mind.</i>  Hey
That's my car
<i>Home was a condo on the 15th floor</i>  <i>of a filing cabinet for widows and professionals.</i>  <i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>  <i>A foot of concrete is important</i>  <i>when your nextdoor neighbor has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>  <i>Or when a blast of debris that used to be your personal effects</i>  <i>blows out of your windows and sails flaming into the night.</i>  <i>I suppose these things happen.</i>  There's... nothing up there
You can't go into the unit
Police orders
Do you have somebody you can call
<i>How embarrassing.</i>  <i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>  <i>The police later told me the pilot light might have gone out</i>  <i>letting out just a little bit of gas.</i>  <i>That gas could have filled the condo.</i>  <i>1700 square feet with high ceilings for days and days.</i>  <i>Then the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on.</i>  <i>Yeah?</i>  <i>I can hear you breathing...</i>  <i>If you ask me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>  <i> Hello
Who's this?</i>  <i> Tyler
Who is this?</i>  We met... We met on the airplane
We had the same suitcase
The clever guy
<i>Oh, yeah
Right.</i>  I called a second ago
There was no answer
<i> I'm at a payphone
Yeah, I *69'd you
I never pick up my phone.</i>  <i>So what's up?</i>  Well
You're not gonna believe this
You know, it could be worse
A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep and toss it out of a car
There's always that
I don't know
When you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that's it
That's the last sofa I'll need
Whatever happens, that sofa problem is handled
I had it all
I had a stereo that was very decent
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable
I was close to being complete
Shit, man
Now it's all gone
All gone
All gone
Do you know what a duvet is
A comforter
It's a blanket
Just a blanket
Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is
Is this essential to our survival in the huntergatherer sense
No
What are we, then
I dunno
Consumers
Right
We're consumers
We are byproducts of a lifestyle obsession
Murder, crime, poverty
These things don't concern me
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,  television with 500 channels,  some guy's name on my underwear
Rogaine
Viagra
Olestra
Martha Stewart
Fuck Martha Stewart
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic
It's all going down
So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns
I say never be complete
I say stop being perfect
I say let's evolve
Let the chips fall where they may
But that's me, and I could be wrong
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy
It's just stuff
Not a tragedy...  You did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living
Fuck, you're right
I don't smoke
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...  What
The things you own end up owning you
Do what you like, man
Oh, it's late
Hey, thanks for the beer
Yeah, man
I should find a hotel
What
What
A hotel
Yeah
Just ask, man
What are you talking about
Oh, God
Three pitchers of beer and you still can't ask
What
You called me because you needed a place to stay
Oh, hey
No, no, no
Yes, you did
So just ask
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man
Would... Would that be a problem
Is it a problem for you to ask
Can I stay at your place
Yeah
Thanks
I want you to do me a favor
Yeah, sure
I want you to hit me as hard as you can
What
I want you to hit me as hard as you can
<i>Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.</i>  <i>Tyler was a night person.</i>  While the rest of us slept, he worked
He had one parttime job as a projectionist
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel
It comes on a few
Someone has to switch the projectors at the exact moment  that one reel ends and the next one begins
You can see little dots come into the upper right corner of the screen
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns
That's the cue for a changeover
He flips the projectors, movie keeps going and the audience has no idea
Why would anyone want this shitjob
Because it affords him interesting opportunities
Like splicing a frame of pornography into family films
So when the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices first meet,  that's when you'll catch a flash of Tyler's contribution to the film
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did
Nice, big cock
Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel
<i>He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.</i>  Do not watch
I cannot go when you watch
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque, he farted on meringues,  and as for the cream of mushroom soup...  Go ahead, tell 'em
You get the idea
You just want me to hit you
Come on
Do me this one favor
Why
I don't know
Never been in a fight
You
No
But that's a good thing
You can't know yourself if you haven't
I don't wanna die without any scars
Come on
Hit me, before I lose my nerve
Oh, God
This is crazy
So go crazy
Let it rip
I don't know about this
I don't either
Who gives a shit
Noone's watching
What do you care
This is crazy
You want me to hit you?
That's right
Where
Like, in the face
Surprise me
This is so fucking stupid
Motherfucker
He hit me in the ear
Well, Jesus, I'm sorry
Ow, Christ
Why the ear, man
I fucked it up
No, that was perfect
No, it's all right
It really hurts
Right
Hit me again
No, you hit me
Come on
We should do this again sometime
Where's your car
What car
<i>I don't know how Tyler found that house</i>  <i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>  <i>It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.</i>  <i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>  <i>There was no lock on the front door from when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>  <i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>  <i>I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.</i>  <i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>  Yep
That's you
That's me
That's the toilet
Good
Yeah, thanks
<i>What a shithole.</i>  <i>Nothing worked.</i>  <i>Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.</i>  <i>There were no neighbors
Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>  <i>That fart smell of steam
The hamstercage smell of wood chips.</i>  What have we here
Hey, guys
Hey
<i>Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.</i>  <i>By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV.</i>  <i>I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.</i>  Can I be next
All right, man
Lose the tie
<i>At night, Tyler and I were alone for half a mile in every direction.</i>  <i>Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>  <i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>  <i>Everywhere were rusted nails to snag your elbow on.</i>  <i>The previous occupant had been a shutin.</i>  Hey, man
What are you reading
Listen to this
It's an article written by an organ in the first person
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata
Without me,  Jack could not regulate his heart rate or breathing.
There's a whole series of these
"I Am Jill's Nipples.
"I Am Jack's Colon.
"I Get Cancer
I Kill Jack.
<i>After fighting, everything else in life got the volume turned down.</i>  What
<i> You could deal with anything
Have you finished those reports?</i>  <i>If you could choose, who would you fight?</i>  I'd fight my boss, probably
Really
Yeah, why
Who would you fight
I'd fight my dad
I don't know my dad
I mean, I know him, but..
He left when I was like, six years old
Married this other woman and had some other kids
He did this every six years
He changes city and starts a new family
Fucker's setting up franchises
My dad never went to college
So it was real important that I go
That sounds familiar
So I graduate
Call him up longdistance and say, "Dad, now what?
He says, "Get ajob.
Same here
Now I'm 25
Make my yearly call again
"Dad, now what?
He says, "I dunno
Get married.
You can't get married
I'm a 30yearold boy
We're a generation of men raised by women
I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need
<i>Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>  <i>But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.</i>  <i>We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.</i>  <i>It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>  <i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>  <i>I should have been looking for a new condo or haggling with my insurance company.</i>  <i>I should have been upset about my nice flaming little shit.</i>  <i>But I wasn't.</i>  The premise of cybernetting an office is make things more efficient
<i>Monday mornings, I just thought about next week.</i>  Can I get the icon in cornflower blue
Absolutely
Efficiency is priority No.1, people
Because waste is a thief
I showed this to my man here
You liked it, didn't you
<i>You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.</i>  <i>It was right in everyone's face.</i>  <i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>  <i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i>  <i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>  Come on, you've gotta go home
Turn off the jukebox
Lock the back
<i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.</i>  Gentlemen
Welcome to Fight Club
The first rule of Fight Club is  you do not talk about Fight Club
The second rule of Fight Club is  you do not talk about Fight Club
Third rule of Fight Club
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,  the fight is over
Fourth rule
Only two guys to a fight
Fifth rule
One fight at a time, fellas
Sixth rule
No shirts
No shoes
Seventh rule
Fights will go on as long as they have to
And the eighth and final rule
If this is your first night at Fight Club  you have to fight
<i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>  <i>couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>  <i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>  <i>when he trounced the maitre d' of a local food court.</i>  <i>Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat, hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>  <i>Or the wet choke when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>  Stop
<i>You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.</i>  <i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>  <i>Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight,</i>  <i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>  <i>Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were outside of it.</i>  <i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>  <i>After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.</i>  If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight
Alive or dead
Doesn't matter
Who'd be tough
Hemingway
You
Shatner
I'd fight William Shatner
<i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>  <i>Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up.</i>  <i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>  <i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>  Is that what a man looks like
Oh, selfimprovement is masturbation
Now, selfdestruction..
Excuse me
<i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>  <i>It wasn't about words.</i>  <i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues</i>  <i>like at a Pentecostal Church.</i>   Is that it
Stop
<i>When the fight was over, nothing was solved.</i>  <i>But nothing mattered.</i>  Cool
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>  Hey, man
How about next week
How about next month?
Irvine, you're in the middle
New guy, you too
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>  He fell down some stairs
I fell down some stairs
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>  OK. Any historical figure
I'd fight Gandhi
Good answer
How about you
Lincoln
Lincoln
Big guy, big reach
Skinny guys fight till they're burger
Fuck
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart
Hello
<i>Where have you been the last eight weeks?</i>  <i>Marla?</i>  <i> How did you find me
You left a forwarding number.</i>  I haven't seen you at any support groups
<i>We split 'em up
That was the idea
Remember?</i>  Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours
How do you know
I cheated
I found a new one
Really
It's for men only
Like the testicle thing
Look, this is a bad time
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous
<i> They're really fuckedup people..
I'm on my way out.</i>  Me too
I've got a stomach full of Xanax
I took what was left of a bottle
It might have been too much
<i>Picture Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.</i>  This isn't a forreal suicide thing
This is probably a cryforhelp thing
So you're staying in tonight, then
Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death
<i>Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>  <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>  <i>Tyler's door was closed
I'd been here for two months and his door was never closed.</i>  You won't believe this dream I had last night
I can hardly believe anything about last night
What are you doing here
What
This is my house
What are you doing here
Fuck you
Oh, you've got some fuckedup friends
Limber, though
Silly cooze
I come in last night
Phone's off the hook
Guess who's on the other end
<i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>  <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>  Do you think it'll live up to its name
<i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>  <i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>  <i>Ten,</i>  <i>nine,... eight...</i>  <i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>  <i>think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>  <i>Five,</i>  <i>four...</i>  Hang on
You got here fast
Did I call you
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic
Oh, don't worry
It's not a threat to you
Oh, fuck
Somebody called the cops
Hey, where's 513
End of the hall
The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl
She has lost faith in herself
Miss Singer, let us help you
She's a monster
You have every reason to live
She's infectious human waste
Miss Singer
Good luck trying to save her
If I fall asleep,  I'm done for
You're gonna have to keep me up  all night
Unfuckingbelievable
<i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>   You know what I mean, you fucked her
No, I didn't
Never
No
You're not into her, are you
No
God, not at all
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>  Are you sure
You can tell me
Believe me, I'm sure
<i> Put a gun to my head and spray my brains
That's good.</i>  She's a predator posing as a house pet
Stay away
The shit that came out of this woman's mouth, I had never heard
My God
I haven't been fucked like that since grade school
<i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>  <i>The other night, he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.</i>  Marla doesn't need a lover, just a caseworker
Or a wash
This isn't love, it's sport fucking
<i>She invaded my support groups and now my home.</i>  Hey, hey
Sit down
Now, listen
I can't have you talking to her about me
Why would I...  Say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or anybody,... we're done
Now promise me
You promise
OK.   Yeah, I promise
Promise
I just said, I promise
What...  That's three times you promised
<i>If only I had wasted a few minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>  <i>none of this would have happened.</i>  Harder, yes
Oh, harder, harder
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>  <i>On the third floor where I might not have heard them.</i>  <i>But I didn't.</i>   What are you doing
Just going to bed
Wanna finish her off
No
No, thank you
I've found a cigarette
Who were you talking to
Shut up
<i>I became the calm little center of the world.</i>  <i>I was the Zen master.</i>  <i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>  <i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>  Is that your blood
Some of it, yeah
You can't smoke in here
Take the rest of the day off
Come back Monday with some clean clothes
Get yourself together
<i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i>  <i>"Yes, these are bruises from fighting
"</i>  <i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that
"</i>  <i>"I am enlightened
"</i>  <i>You give up the condo life, give up all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>  <i>move to a dilapidated house in a toxic waste area,</i>  <i>and you have to come home to this.</i>  <i> Hello
This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.</i>  <i>We have some new information about the incident at your former condo.</i>  Yes
I don't know if you're aware, but someone sprayed Freon into your frontdoor lock
<i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>  No, I wasn't aware of that
<i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>  Does this sound strange to you
<i>Yes, sir, strange
Very strange.</i>  <i> The dynamite  Dynamite?</i>  left a residue of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride
<i> Do you know what this means
No, what does it mean?</i>  It means it was homemade
I'm sorry
This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown out your pilot light days before the explosion
<i> The gas was just a detonator
Who would go and do that?</i>  <i> I'll ask the questions
Tell him.</i>  Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property realigned my perceptions
<i>Excuse me
Are you there?</i>  I am listening
It's hard to know what to make of this
Have you recently made enemies who might have access to homemade dynamite
Enemies
Reject civilization,  especially material possessions
<i> Son, this is serious
Yes, I know it's serious.</i>  <i> I mean that
Yes, it's very serious.</i>  Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me
That condo was my life
OK
I loved every stick of furniture in that place
<i>That was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed.</i>  <i> It was me
I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>  <i> Is this not a good time for you
Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>  Tell him you blew it all up
That's what he wants to hear
<i> Are you still there
Wait
Are you saying that I'm a suspect?</i>  No
I may need to talk to you, so you let me know if you're gonna leave town
<i> OK
OK.</i>  <i>Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.</i>  <i>My parents pulled this exact same act for years.</i>  The condom is the glass slipper of our generation
You slip one on when you meet a stranger
You... dance all night
Then you throw it away
The condom, I mean
Not the stranger
What
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1
It was worth every penny
It's a bridesmaid's dress
Someone loved it intensely  for one day
Then tossed it
Like a Christmas tree
So special
Then  bam
It's on the side of the road
Tinsel still clinging to it
Like a sex crime victim
Underwear inside out
Bound with electrical tape
Well then, it suits you
You can borrow it sometime
Get rid of her
<i> What
You get rid of her
Don't mention me.</i>  <i>I am six years old again, passing messages between parents.</i>   I really think it's time you left
Don't worry, I'm leaving
Not that we don't love your visits
You are such a nutcase
I can't keep up
Gotta get off  Thanks
Bye
Gotta get off of this merrygoround  Gonna get, need to get...  Gotta get...  You kids
Why do you still waste time with her
I'll say this about Marla
<i>At least she's trying to hit bottom.</i>  And I'm not
Feathers up your butt do not make you a chicken
What are we doing tonight
Tonight... we make soap
Really
To make soap, first we render fat
The salt balance has to be just right  so the best fat for soap comes from humans
Wait, what is this place
A liposuction clinic
Pay dirt
Richest, creamiest fat in the world
Fat of the land
No
Don't pull it, don't pull it
Oh, God
Give me another one
As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface
Like in Boy Scouts
It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout
Keep stirring
Once the tallow hardens, you skim off a layer of glycerin
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust, you've got dynamite
Yeah, with enough soap, one could blow up just about anything
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>  People found clothes got cleaner when washed at a certain point in the river
You know why
No
Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river
Bodies burnt
Water permeated the ashes to create lye
This is lye
The crucial ingredient
Once it mixed with the melted body fat, a white soapy discharge crept into the river
May I see your hand, please
What is this
This is a chemical burn
It will hurt more than any burn and it will leave a scar
<i>Meditation worked for cancer, it could work now.</i>   Don't shut the pain out
Oh, God
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes, like the first monkey shot into space
Without pain or sacrifice, we would have nothing
<i>I tried not to think of the word searing of flesh.</i>  Stop it
This is your pain, this is your burning hand
I'm going to my cave to find my power animal
No
Don't deal with this the way those dead people do
Come on
I get the point
No
You're feeling premature enlightenment
It's the greatest moment of your life, and you're off somewhere else
I am not
Shut up
Our fathers were our models for God
If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God
Listen to me
You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you
He never wanted you
In all probability, He hates you
This is not the worst thing that can happen
We don't need Him
I agree
Fuck damnation, fuck redemption
We are God's unwanted children
So be it
I'm getting water
You can use water and make it worse or...   Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn
Please let me up
First, you have to give up
First, you have to know, not fear,  know that some day, you're gonna die
You don't know how this feels
It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything
OK.  Congratulations
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom
<i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar.</i>  <i>God knows what they charged.</i>   This is the best soap
Why, thank you, Susan
<i>It was beautiful.</i>  <i>We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.</i>  <i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>  <i>I didn't wear a tie to work any more.</i>  "The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club.
<i>I'm halfasleep again
I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>  "The second rule..." Is this yours
Pretend you're me
Make a managerial decision
You find this
What would you do
Well, I gotta tell you,  I'd be very, very careful who you talk to about that
Because the person who wrote that is dangerous
And this buttondown, Oxfordcloth psycho might just snap  and then stalk from office to office  with an Armalite AR10 carbine gaspowered semiautomatic weapon,  pumping round after round into colleagues and coworkers
This might be someone you've known for years
Someone very, very close to you
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>  <i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>  Or maybe you shouldn't bring me every piece of trash you pick up
Compliance and Liability
My tit's gonna rot off
Will you excuse me
I need to take this
What do you mean
I need you to check for a lump in my breast
Go to a hospital
I can't afford to waste money on a doctor
I don't know about this, Marla
Please
<i>She didn't call Tyler
I'm neutral in her book.</i>  That's nice
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines
Where are they, exactly
Tragically, they're dead
I'm alive and I'm in poverty
Want any
No, no
I got one for you
Thanks for the thought
What happened to your hand
Oh, nothing
Right there
Feel anything
No
Well, make sure
OK, I'm pretty sure
You feel nothing
No, nothing
Well, that's a relief
Thank you
No problem
I wish I could return the favor
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family
I could check your prostate
I think I'm OK.  Well, thanks, anyway
Are we done
Yeah, we're done
See you... around
Cornelius
Cornelius
It's me
Bob
Hey, Bob
We all thought you were dead
No, no
Still here
How are you, Bob
Better than I've ever been in my whole life
Really
Still remaining men together
No, no
I got something so much better now
Really, what is it
Well..
The first rule is, I'm not supposed to talk about it
And the second rule is  I'm not supposed to talk about it
And the third rule is...  Bob, Bob
I'm a member
Look at my face, Bob
That's fucking... fucking great
I've never seen you there
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays
I go Saturday
Congratulations
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right
Have you heard about the guy that invented it
Yeah, actually..
I hear all kinds of things
Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution  and he sleeps only one hour a night
He's a great man
Do you know about Tyler Durden
I didn't hurt you, did I
Actually, you did
Thank you for this
Thank you, thank you, thank you
<i>Fight Club.</i>  <i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>  <i>Our gift to the world.</i>  I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces
Shut up
Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club
I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived
I see all this potential
And I see it squandered
Goddamn it, an entire generation pumping gas
Waiting tables
Slaves with white collars
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes
Working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need
We're the middle children of history
No purpose or place
We have no Great War
No Great Depression
Our great war is a spiritual war
Our great depression is our lives
We've all been raised on television to believe  that one day we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars
But we won't
We're slowly learning that fact
And we're very, very pissed off
Yeah
First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...  Who are you
Who am I
Yeah
There's a sign on the front that says Lou's Tavern
I'm fucking Lou
Who the fuck are you
Tyler Durden
Who told you motherfuckers that you could use my place
We have a deal worked out with Irvine
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone
He don't own this place
I do
How much money's he getting for this
There is no money
Free to all
Ain't that something
It is, actually
Look, stupid fuck
I want everybody out of here right now
Hey
You should join our club
Did you hear what I just said
You and your friend
You hear me now
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou
Still not getting it
OK, OK, I got it
I got it, I got it
Shit, I lost it
Back
All of you
Everybody back
Ah, Lou
Come on, man
We really like this place
That's right, Lou
Get it out
Shut the fuck up
Oh, yeah
Is that fucking funny
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you
Unbelievable
You don't know where I've been, Lou
Oh, my God
You don't know where I've been
Please let us keep it, Lou
Please, Lou
Fucking use the basement
Christ
I want your word, Lou
I want your word
On my mother's eyes
Thanks, Lou
You too, big guy
We'll see you next week
This week, each one of you has a homework assignment
You're gonna go out
You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger
You're gonna start a fight  and you're gonna lose
Excellent choice, sir
Hey
Watch out, jackass
Come on
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>  Son of a bitch
<i>Most people, normal people, do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>  Excuse me
You sprayed me with your hose
That's not necessary...  Jay
Go call 911
Put the hose down
Stop it
Stop it
Sorry
We need to talk
OK.  Where to begin
With your constant absenteeism
With your unpresentable appearance
You're up for review
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise
What
Let's pretend
You're the Department of Transportation, OK
Someone informs you that this company  installs frontseat mounting brackets that failed collision tests,  brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,  and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive
What then
Are you threatening me
No...  Get the fuck out of here
You're fired
I have a better solution
Keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant
In exchange for my salary,  my job will be never to tell people these things that I know
I don't even have to come into the office
I can do this job from home
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit
<i> Security
I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>  What the hell are you doing
That hurt
Why would you do that
Oh, my God
No
Please stop
What are you doing
Oh, God, no
Please
No
<i>For some reason, I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>  No
<i>Under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted,</i>  <i>something horrible had been growing.</i>  Look
Give me the paychecks, like I asked, and you won't ever see me again
<i>Then, at our most excellent moment together...</i>  Thank God
Please don't hit me again
<i>Telephone, computer,</i>  <i>fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>  <i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>  <i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.</i>  <i>Now, the center of Fight Club became the two men fighting.</i>  <i>The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.</i>  <i>Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>  <i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>  <i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>  Thank you, sir
<i>Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.</i>  <i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>   There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City
Yeah, I heard
There's one in Penns Grove too
Bob even found one up in New Castle
Did you start that one
No, I thought you did
No
Stop for a second
Hey, what are we doing
Turn around
What are we doing
Homework assignment
What kind
Human sacrifice
Is that a gun
Please tell me it's not
It's a gun
What are you doing
Meet me in the back
Don't fuck around
Meet me in the back
<i>On a long enough time line,</i>  <i>the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>  What are you doing
Come on
Hands behind your back
Give me your wallet
Raymond K Hessel
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A
Small, cramped basement apartment
How did you know
They give shitty apartments letters
Raymond
You're going to die
No
Is that your mom and dad
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor
Pick up your dental records
Know why
There'll be nothing left of your face
Oh, come on
An expired community college student ID
What did you study, Raymond
S... S... Stuff
Stuff
Were the midterms hard
I asked you what you studied
Biology, mostly
Why
I don't know
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?
The question, Raymond, was what did you want to be
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus
Veterinarian
Veterinarian
Animals
Yeah
Animals and stuff
Stuff
Yeah, I got that
So you need more schooling
Too much school
Would you rather be dead
No, please...  You'd rather die here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store
Please, no
I'm keeping your license
Gonna check in on you
I know where you live
If you're not working to be a veterinarian in six weeks,  you will be dead
Now run on home
Run, Forrest, run
I feel ill
Imagine how he feels
Come on, this isn't funny
What the fuck was the point of that?
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K Hessel's life
His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted
<i>You had to give it to him.</i>  <i> Come on
He had a plan.</i>  <i>And it started to make sense in a Tylersort of way.</i>  <i>No fear
No distractions.</i>  <i>The ability to let that which does not matter</i>  <i>truly slide.</i>  <i>You are not your job.</i>  You're not how much money you have in the bank
You're not the car you drive
You're not the contents of your wallet
You're not your fucking khakis
You are the allsinging, alldancing crap of the world
I'll be out of your way in a sec
You don't have to go
Whatever
No, I mean..
It's OK.  Are you still going to groups
Yeah
Chloe's dead
Wow, Chloe
When did that happen
Do you care
I dunno
I haven't thought about it in a while
Yeah, well..
It was the smart move on her part
Listen...  What are you getting out of all this
What
I mean, all this
Why do you keep...  Is this making you happy
Yeah, well, sometimes
I don't know
I don't understand
Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person
What is... What is that
What do you get out of it
No... That's not the same thing at all
It's totally different with us
Us
What do you mean by us
I'm sorry
Do you hear this
Hear what
All that noise
Hold on
No, wait
Don't change the subject
I want to talk about this
You're not talking about me, are you
No
What
Playing doctor
What was going on there
What are you talking about
Nothing
Nothing
I don't think so
What do you want
Look at me
No
What
What is that?
It's nothing
Don't worry
My God
Who did this
A person
Guy or girl
What do you care
What do you care if I ask
Leave me alone
You're afraid to say
I am not
Let me go
No
Talk to me
Let go of me
This conversation  This conversation   is over
is over
I just can't win with you, can I
Hey, this is getting a little old
What is... What is all this
What do you think
Hey, why do we need bunk beds
Hey
Too young
Sorry
What's all that
If the applicant is young, tell him he's too young
Old, too old
Fat, too fat
Applicant
If the applicant waits three days without food or shelter,  he may enter and begin training
Training for what
You think this is a game
You're too young to train here, end of story
Quit wasting our time
Get the fuck out of here
Bad news, friend
It's not gonna happen
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding
It's not the end of the world
Just... go away
Go
You're trespassing and I will have to call the police
Don't you look at me
You're never getting in this fucking house
Never
Now get the fuck off my porch
Get off my porch
<i>Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>  I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna get a shovel
Got two black shirts
Yes, sir
Two pair of black pants
Yes, sir
One pair black boots
Black socks
Yes, sir
One blackjacket
Yes, sir
$300 personal burial money
Yes, sir
All right
You're too old, fat man
Your tits are too big
Get the fuck off my porch
Bob
Bob
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space
Space monkey
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good
You are too fucking old, fatty
And you... You're too fucking  blond
Get out of here, the both of you
<i>And so it went.</i>  Listen up, maggots
You are not special
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>  <i>We are the allsinging, alldancing crap of the world.</i>  <i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>  <i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>  <i>To what purpose?</i>  <i>For what greater good?</i>  <i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>  When he was like, "You are not yourjob",  I was like, "Yeah!
Hey, what's all this
Hey
OK
What's going on
We're celebrating
What are we celebrating
Go on
Hey
Let me get that for you
<i>The same great taste, Pepsi.</i>  Ssh
<i>Investigators are here
The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>  <i>Could you tell us what you think has happened here?</i>  <i>We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism in the city</i>  <i>somehow related to underground boxing clubs.</i>  <i>We will be coordinating a rigorous investigation.</i>  <i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs who just arrived on the scene</i>  <i> of a fouralarm fire that broke out...  She's hot.</i>  <i>Back to you in the studio.</i>   Yeah
Yeah
Holy shit
Yeah
What the fuck did you guys do
<i>Arson investigators are on the premises...</i>  Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir
The victory in the war against crime  will not come overnight
It will take dedication and commitment and, most of all, cooperation
Streets are safer now
There is hope in the inner city
However..
I gotta take a piss
These are the first steps in a long journey
That is why we have created Project Hope
Bob
Project Hope will be ajoint effort  between the police and community leaders
It will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime
Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack
His balls are ice cold
Hi
You're gonna call off your rigorous investigation
You will publicly state there is no underground group or  these guys are gonna take your balls
<i>They'll send one to the New York Times and one to the LA Times.</i>  Look
The people you are after are the people you depend on
We cook your meals
We haul your trash
We connect your calls
We drive your ambulances
We guard you while you sleep
Do not fuck with us
Ball check
Bob, you're this way
Let's go
<i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>  Hey
Yeah
<i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>  <i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>  <i>I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers</i>  <i>and smother those French beaches I'd never see.</i>  <i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>  Where did you go, psycho boy
I felt like destroying something beautiful
Get him to a fucking hospital
Yeah
Don't worry, Mr Durden
Airport parking
Long term
After you, Mr Durden
After you
Something on your mind, dear
No
Yeah, why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem
First rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions
Why didn't you include me in the beginning
Fight Club was the beginning
Now it's left the basements and it's Project Mayhem
We started Fight Club together
Remember
It's as much mine as it is yours
Is this about you and me
Yeah
Weren't we doing this together
This does not belong to us
We are not special
Fuck that
You should have told me
Hey, Tyler
Goddamn it, Tyler
What do you want?
A statement of purpose
Should I email you
Oh...  You decide your level of involvement
I will
I wanna know certain things first
The first rule of Project Mayhem..
Shut up
I wanna know what you're thinking
Fuck what you know
Forget about what you think you know about life, friendship,  and especially about you and me
What is that supposed to mean
What are you doing
What do you wish you'd done before you died
Paint a selfportrait
Build a house
And you
I don't know
Nothing
Get in the right lane
You have to know
If you died now, how would you feel about your life
I don't know
Nothing good
Is that what you want to hear
Come on
Not good enough
Stop fucking around
Tyler
Jesus Christ
Goddamn it
Goddamn it
Fuck you
Fuck Fight Club
Fuck Marla
I am sick of all your shit
OK, man
Quit screwing around
Steer
Look at you
Steer
Look at you
You're fucking pathetic
Why
Why
What are you talking about
Why do you think I blew up your condo
What
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat
It's not a goddamned seminar
Stop trying to control everything and just let go
Let go
All right
Fine
Fine
<i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>  <i>This must have been what all those people felt like</i>  <i>before I filed them as statistics in my reports.</i>  Goddamn
We've just had a nearlife experience
In the world I see,  you're stalking elk through the Grand Canyon forests  around the ruins of Rockefeller Center
You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower
And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,  laying strips of venison in the empty carpool lane  of some abandoned superhighway
Feel better, champ
<i>And then...</i>  Tyler
<i>..Tyler was gone.</i>  <i>Was I asleep?</i>  <i>Had I slept?</i>  You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...  <i>The house had become a living thing.</i>  <i>Wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.</i>  <i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>  <i>Planet Tyler.</i>  <i>I had to hug the walls.</i>  <i>Trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>  You shouldn't be smoking in here
You know how much ether is here
<i>Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.</i>  Hang on a second
It's under control, sir
Where's Tyler
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not..
Right... OK.  <i>I'm all alone.</i>  <i>My father dumped me
Tyler dumped me.</i>  <i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>  <i>What comes next in Project Mayhem only Tyler knows.</i>  <i>The second rule is you do not ask questions.</i>  Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away
Who are all these people
The Paper Street Soap Company
Can I come in
He's not here
What
Tyler isn't here
Tyler went away
Tyler's gone
Get some help
Two gunshot wounds coming through
Make some fucking room
What happened
What happened
We were on assignment
We were supposed to kill two birds with one stone
Destroy a piece of corporate art...  Operation Latte Thunder
Go
..and trash a franchise coffee bar
We had it all worked out, sir
It went smooth until...  Police
Freeze
What
They shot Bob
They shot him in the head
Fucking pigs
Oh, God
Those motherfuckers
You morons
You're running around in ski masks trying to blow things up
What did you think was gonna happen?
OK, quick
Get rid of the evidence
We gotta get rid of this body
Bury him
What
Take him to the garden and bury him
Come on, people, let's go
Get the fuck off
Get away from him
What are you talking about
This isn't fucking evidence
This is a person
He's my friend and you're not burying him in the garden
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir
This is Bob
Sir, in..
In Project Mayhem, we have no names
Now, you listen to me
This is a man and he has a name, and it's Robert Paulsen, OK
Robert Paulsen
He's a man  and he's dead now because of us
Do you understand that
I understand
In death, a member of Project Mayhem  has a name
<i>His name is Robert Paulsen.</i>  His name is Robert Paulsen
His name... is Robert Paulsen
His name is Robert Paulsen
Come on, guys
Please
Stop it
His name is Robert Paulsen
Shut up
This is all over with
Get the fuck out of here
Tyler
No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit
I need to see you...  <i>I went to all the cities on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.</i>  <i>I didn't know how or why, but I could look at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>  <i>I'm looking for Tyler Durden
It's very important that I talk to him.</i>  I wish I could help you,  sir
<i>Every city I went to,</i>  <i>as soon as I set foot off the plane</i>  <i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>  Hey
Hey
Taxi
Look at my face
I'm a member
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler
I'm not exposed to bespeak any such information to you  nor would I, even if I had said information at this juncture,... be able
You're a moron
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
<i>Tyler had been busy... setting up franchises all over the country.</i>  <i>Was I asleep
Had I slept?</i>  <i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>   We've just heard the stories
What kind of stories
Nobody knows what he looks like
He has plastic surgery every three years
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard
Is it true about Fight Club in Miami
Is Mr Durden building an army
<i>I was living in a state of perpetual d茅j脿 vu.</i>  <i>Everywhere I went,</i>  <i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>  <i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>  <i>The smell of dried blood,</i>  <i>dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>  <i>That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.</i>  <i>The feel of a floor still warm from a fight the night before.</i>  <i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>  His name is Robert Paulsen..
Welcome back, sir
How have you been
Do you know me
Is this a test, sir
No
This is not a test
You were in here last Thursday
Thursday
You were standing where you are now, asking how good security is
It's tight as a drum, sir
Who do you think I am
Are you sure this isn't a test
No, this is not a test
You're Mr Durden
You're the one who gave me this
<i>Please return your seat backs to their full upright and locked position.</i>  <i> Yeah
Marla, it's me.</i>  <i> Have we ever done it
Done what?</i>  Had sex
What kind of stupid question is that
Stupid because it's yes or because it's no
<i> Is this a trick
No
I need to know...</i>  You wanna know if I think we were just having sex or making love
<i> We did make love
Is that what you're calling it?</i>  Just answer the question
Did we do it or not?
You fuck me, then snub me
You love me, you hate me
You're sensitive, then you turn into an asshole
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler
<i>We just lost cabin pressure.</i>  What did you just say
What is wrong with you
Say my name
Tyler Durden
You fucking freak
What's going on
I'm coming over
I'm not there
You broke your promise
Jesus, Tyler
You fucking talked to her about me
What the fuck is going on
I asked you for one thing
One simple thing
Why do people think that I'm you
Answer me
Sit
Answer me
Why do people think I'm you
I think you know
No, I don't
Yes, you do
Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me
I..
I don't know
You got it
No
Do not fuck with us
Say it
Because...  Say it
Because we're the same person
That's right
<i>We are the allsinging, alldancing crap.</i>   I don't understand this
You wanted a way to change your life
You could not do this on your own
All the ways you wish you could be,  that's me
I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,  I'm free in all the ways that you are not
Oh, no
Tyler's not here
Tyler went away
What
This isn't possible
This is crazy
People do it every day
They talk to themselves
They see themselves as they'd like to be
They don't have the courage you have to just run with it
You still wrestle with it, so sometimes you're still you
We should do this again sometime
At times, you imagine you're watching me
If this is your first time, you have to fight
Little by little, you're just letting yourself become  Tyler Durden
You are not yourjob or how much money you have
No
You have a house
Rented in your name
You have jobs, a life
You work nights because you can't sleep
Or you stay up and make soap
You're fucking Marla, Tyler
Technically, you are
It's all the same to her
Oh, my God
Now you see our dilemma
She knows too much
I think we're gonna have to talk about how this might compromise our goals
What... What are you saying
This is bullshit
This is bullshit, I'm not listening to this
You are insane
No
You're insane
We simply do not have time for this crap
<i>It's called a changeover.</i>  <i>The movie goes on</i>  <i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>   Sir
Are you checking out
Yeah
Bill me
Can you initial this list of phone calls
When were these made
Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier every night
Have I been sleeping later?</i>  <i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>  Is anybody here
<i>D茅j脿 vu all over again.</i>  With enough soap, one could blow up anything
Oh, my God
<i> 1888.  Who am I calling?</i>  <i>1888 Franklin
This is maintenance
Hello?</i>  <i>Hello?</i>  1888 Franklin Street
<i>Yes
Can I help you?</i>  <i> Hello
Yeah, yeah.</i>  I need to talk to your supervisor right away
<i> Speaking
OK, listen to me.</i>  Something terrible is about to happen to your building
<i>It's under control, sir.</i>  <i> Excuse me
Don't worry about us, sir
We're solid.</i>  <i>2160.</i>  Marla
Marla
Hey, wait
Wait
I gotta talk to you
Marla
Marla
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom
They almost broke my arm
They were burning their fingertips with lye
This needs a tremendous act of faith on your part, but hear me out
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit
A little more faith than that
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say
You have every right to be..
I'll just have a coffee, thanks
Sir
Anything you order is free of charge, sir
Why is it free of charge
Don't ask
Whatever
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie
Clean food, please
In that case, may I advise against the clam chowder
No clam chowder
Thank you
You got about 30 seconds
I know I've been acting very strange, OK
I know it seems there's two sides to me...  Two sides
You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass
I know
But I realized something important
What
The nature of our relationship wasn't clear  to me for reasons I won't go into
I know I haven't treated you well
Whatever
No, no
Fifteen seconds, please
Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry
What I've come to realize is that I really like you, Marla
You do
I really do
I care about you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of me
Marla, your life is in danger
What
You need to leave town for a while
Get out of any major city
Just go camping...  You're an insane person
No
I've involved you in something terrible
No
Shut up
You're not safe
Shut up
Listen, I tried, Tyler
I really tried
I know you did
There are things about you I like
You're smart, funny
You're spectacular in bed
But  you're intolerable
You have very serious emotional problems
Deepseated problems for which you should seek professional help
I know, and I'm sorry
You're sorry, I'm sorry
Everyone's sorry
I can't do this any more
I can't
And I won't
I'm gone
You can't leave, Marla
You're not safe
Marla, you don't understand
Leave me alone
Marla, I am trying to protect you
Let go
I don't ever wanna see you again
That's fine..
Here, wait right here
Hold it right there
Shut up
Take this money and get on this bus
I promise I won't bother you again
Shut up
Please get on the bus
Please get on the bus
Why are you doing this
They think you're a threat
I can't explain it now, just trust me
If I know where you are, you won't be safe
I'll keep this, it's asshole tax
Fine
Remember, stay out of major cities
Tyler
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me
Hello
I need you to arrest me
I am the leader of a terrorist organization  responsible for numerous acts of vandalism and assault all over this city
In the metropolitan area, we had probably 200 members
Chapters have sprung up in five or six other major cities already
This is a tightlyregimented organization  with many cells capable of operating independent of central leadership
Go to the house, OK
1537 Paper Street
That's our headquarters
In the back, buried in the garden,  you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen
In the basement, you're gonna find some bathtubs  that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin
I believe the plan is to blow up  the headquarters of these credit card companies  and the TRW building
Why these buildings
Why credit card companies
If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero
You'll create total chaos
Keep him talking
I need to make a phone call
I really admire what you're doing
What
You're a brave man to order this
You're a genius, sir
You said if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem, even you,  we gotta get his balls
Don't fight
It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden
It will set an example
You're making a big mistake
You said you'd say that
I'm not Tyler Durden
You told us you'd say that too
All right
I am Tyler Durden
Listen to me
I'm giving you a direct order
We're aborting this mission now
You said you would definitely say that
Are you fucking out of your minds
You're police officers
Is somebody timing this
Keep your mouth shut
Shit
Some of this information checks out
Let's go to that house on Paper Street
Be right there
Hey, wait
I got him
Sir, we have to do this
Stop fighting
Where's the rubber band
Get away from me
Drop that fucking knife
Back up
Face down on the floor right now
Get down on the floor
The first person that comes out of this door  gets a lead salad
Understand
Get away
Stay away
<i>I ran.</i>  <i>I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>  <i>Then I ran some more.</i>  What the fuck are you doing
Running around in your underpants
You look crazy
No
I'm onto you
I know what's going on here
Come on, then
I got us a great place to watch from
It'll be like payperview
Oh, Christ
Now what are you doing
I'm stopping this
Why
The greatest thing you've ever done
I can't let this happen
There are 10 other bombs in 10 other buildings
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder
The buildings are empty
We're not killing anyone
We're setting 'em free
Bob is dead
They shot him in the head
You wanna make an omelette, you gotta break some eggs
No
I'm not listening to you
You're not even there
I wouldn't do that
Not unless you knew which wires were what
If you know, I know
<i>Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent all day thinking about the wrong ones.</i>  You think
Oh, heavens, no
Not the green one
Pull any one but the green one
I asked you not to do that
Fuck
Tyler, get away from the van
Tyler, I'm not kidding
Get away from the van
Goddamn it
OK.  You are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend  near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin
Cool it, Tyler
Come on
Don't go
What?
Three minutes
This is it
The beginning
Ground zero
<i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>  Do you have a speech for the occasion
I'm sorry
I still can't think of anything
Flashback humor
It's getting exciting now
Two and a half
Think of everything we've accomplished
Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history
One step closer to economic equilibrium
Why is she here
Tying up loose ends
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck
I beg you, please don't do this
I'm not doing this
<i> We are doing this
This is what we want
No.</i>   I don't want this
Right
Except you is meaningless now
We have to forget about you
You're a voice in my head
You're a voice in mine
Why can't I get rid of you
You need me
No
I don't
I really don't any more
You created me
I didn't create some loser alter ego to make me feel better
Take some responsibility
I do
I am responsible for all of it  and I accept that
So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off
Have I ever let us down
How far have you come because of me?
I will bring us through this
As always, I will carry you kicking and screaming  and in the end you will thank me
Tyler
Tyler
I'm grateful to you
For everything that you've done for me
But this is too much
I don't want this
What do you want
Your shitjob back
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms
Fuck you
I won't do it
This can't be happening
It's already done, so shut up
60 seconds till CRI
No
I can figure this out
This isn't even real
You're not real, that gun... That gun isn't even in your hand
The gun's in my hand
Good for you
It doesn't change a thing
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head
Not my head, Tyler
Our head
Interesting
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy
Hey
It's you and me
Friends
Tyler,  I want you to really listen to me
OK.  My eyes are open
What's that smell
Where is everybody
Oh, no
What's going on
Mr Durden
Oh, my God
Are you... Are you all right, sir
Oh, yeah, I'm OK.  You look terrible, sir
What happened
Nothing, it's no problem
No, no, no, sir
He's not kidding
You look awful
You need assistance
I'm fine
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine
Stop it
Let her go
Christ Almighty
You
Hi, Marla
Leave her with me
Meet me downstairs
Are you sure
Yes, I'm sure
You fucker
What kind of sick fucking game are you playing at?
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face
Yeah, I know
What happened
Don't ask
You're shot
Yes, I'm shot
Oh, my God
I can't believe he's standing
One tough motherfucker
Who did this
I did, actually
Find some gauze
You shot yourself
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me
I'm really OK.  Trust me
Everything's gonna be fine
You met me at a very strange time in my life
﻿1 When I think of my wife..
I always think of her head
I picture cracking her lovely skull...  Unspooling her brains..
Trying to get answers
The primal questions of any marriage
"What are you thinking?
"How are you feeling?
"What have we done to each other?
The Irish prince graces us with his presence
His majesty prefers not to be moistened
I got you a present
I hated this game
You loved it
You loved it
Thank you
I'll add it to the collection
Can you pour me a bourbon
What's up, jitters
Well, if you're not going to talk, I'm gonna have to fill the silence...  With another excruciating story by margo dunne
I could tell you about my recent customer service experience...   Changing Internet service providers
I like that one
Or how about the time I saw that woman who looked exactly like my friend Monica
But it wasn't Monica
It was a total stranger
Who was also named Monica
Made it kind of interesting
It's great
I'm just having a bad day
Amy
It's our anniversary
Five years
Five
That came fast
And furious
I'm so crazy, stupid happy
I met a boy
A great, sweet, gorgeous, coolass guy
Excuse me, miss
I just want you to be careful...  Where you put down that monkbrewed Belgian wheat beer...  Because the party's down to three beast lights and a bottle of pucker
It might attract some desperate characters
It could
I mean, the amish are on a rumspringa
They already relieved me of my artisanal meat platter
Finally, someone tells me how to pronounce that word
"Meat"
Yes, "meat.
One syllable
Thank you
Whose beer am I about to drink
Don't tell me
Let's see, who's your type
I don't see you sitting quietly..
While he bloviates on his postgrad thesis about proust
Uhoh
Is that him
Ironic hipster, so selfaware, he makes everything a joke
I prefer men who are funny, not "funny.
What type are you
Cornfed, saltoftheearth Missouri guy
Missouri
Cute
Native new yorker
The world ends at the Hudson
What's your name
Amy
Well, Amy, who are you
A, I'm an awardwinning scrimshander
B, I'm a moderately influential warlord
C, I write personality quizzes for magazines
Okay
Your hands are far too delicate for real scrimshaw work...  And I happen to be a charter subscriber to middling warlord weekly..
So I'd recognize you
I'm gonna go with "c."  And you
Who are you
I'm the guy to save you from all this awesomeness
So, you write for a men's magazine
God, does that make you an expert on being a man
No
It's what to wear, what to drink
How to bullshit
Never with you
Ha, ha
No, I mean it
It's hard to believe you
Why
I think it's your chin
My chin
Yeah, it's quite villainous
Okay, how's this
A hundred percent true, no bullshit
Okay
We all move to New York...  And we end up living in these little cubby holes, and that's not it
Come outside
Then, you're in it
You have to see this
Hey
Hey
I have to kiss you now
Is that right
I can't let you go through a sugar storm unkissed
Wait a second
There you go
Nick dunne..
I really like you
So, is Amy gonna do one of those anniversary...  Treasure hunts
You mean the forced march designed to prove...  What an oblivious and uncaring asshole her husband is
Wow
Life
I don't remember the point
Deep hasbro thoughts
Spin
What was the clue last year she got so mad about
"When your poor Amy has a cold...  "This dessert just must be sold.
The answer
I still don't know the answer, go
A few years ago, you'd have known
A few years ago, it was fun
Year one, the traditional gift was paper
She got me a beautiful notebook
Told me to go write my novel
What did you get her
A kite
She'd never flown a kite
Okay
Anyway
Year four, flowers
She led me outside to the dying rosebush in the backyard
That's symbolic
Yeah
What's the gift for five
Wood
So, what did you get her
There's no good gift for wood
I know
Go home, fuck her brains out, slap her with your penis
"There's some wood for you, bitch.
The bar
Why, yes
Hang on one second
Hey, it's watchful Wally
Hey, Walt
What's going on
Thanks very much
I'll be right there
All right, byebye
Hey, buddy
What are you doing out here
Thanks, Walt
Ame
Amy
Hello
Come on in
Hey
Mister dunne
Hi
I'm detective Rhonda boney
This is officer James gilpin
We understand there are concerns about your wife
I don't know where my wife is
And I came home to this
Now, I don't panic easily..
But it's weird, right
Mind if we look around
Please
How long have you two been here
Two years in September
We used to live in New York
City
Yeah, I was a writer
We were both writers
Why did you all move back here
My mom got sick
Oh, I'm sorry
How is she
She's dead
I'm so sorry
What do you do now, for work
My sister margo and I own the bar downtown
Oh, the bar
Love the name
Very meta
Thanks
Pretty things
Stay
My office, here
Beautiful dress
Date night
It's our anniversary
It's a guest bedroom, there
Cat's room on the end
I checked up here
This is the kitchen...  Obviously
This is my wife's office
Amy's office
Wow
Impressive gal
Yeah
Should I be concerned
I remember these
I loved these books
Wait a minute
Your wife is amazing Amy
Yeah
She is
Wow
AmazingfuckingAmy is getting fucking married
That's how the night started
With me, regular, flawed, real Amy, jealous, as always, of the golden child
Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy, who's getting fucking married
When I was 10, I quit cello
In the next book, amazing Amy became a prodigy
Did you play volleyball
I got cut, freshman year
She made varsity
When did you have a dog
She got the dog
Puddles made her more relatable
Wow
I love your parents..
But they really can be assholes
Nick
Sir
Hey, thanks for coming, man
No problem
Hey, sweetheart
Big night for your mom
It would mean so much if you would talk to a few reporters...  Bloggers, give them a little Amy color
People wanna hear from you
We can't stay long
Fantastic
Fifteen minutes, tops
This is why I have my brownstone
My trust fund
I know I can't complain
Your parents literally plagiarized your childhood
No, they improved upon it, and then peddled it to the masses
I thought you were gonna wear white to match the wedding theme
I thought that would be creepy
"If it's worth doing, it's worth doing..."  hold up
I know how this ends
Don't tell me
You're very cute, Nick
Amy, you know what would make dad's night
I'm on it
I love having strangers pick at my scabs
I'm curious whether..
It's difficult for you to see amazing Amy heading down the aisle
And this big party celebrating this fictional wedding
Because it's my understanding you are not married
Is that correct
Correct
Amazing Amy has always been one step ahead of me
Excuse me
I'm sorry, I just have a few questions
It's you
I'm here in a strictly journalistic capacity
Now, you had the distinct pleasure of dating Nick dunne for how long
Two magical years
Two magical years
In the course of that time, you've had the opportunity...  To perform such gracious gestures as...  Not correcting Nick when he pronounced "quinoa" as "kweenoa.
An understandable mistake
He also thought it was a fish
He thinks velveeta is a cheese
You also manage to appear shocked and delighted..
When Nick's elderly mother breaks into an impromptu rendition...  Of New York, New York, every time she sees you
that's just frightening
You also bought Nick his very first pair of scissors
And matching stapler
Amy elliott, you are more than amazing
You are brilliant, yet entirely unsnobby
You challenge me
You surprise me
And, fun fact for the readers...  You have a worldclass vagina
My colleagues tell me that you are not yet married
Is that correct
I'm not
Isn't it time we fixed that
And then..
The night wasn't so bad anymore
And it's done
Crossed off the list
Now, normally, we would not treat this as a missing persons case so quick..
But given the scene at your house...  And given our spike in violent crime of late...  We are gonna take this very, very seriously
Okay
Good
We've got forensics over at your place
You got somewhere to stay
I could stay at my sister's
Okay
We're tracking Amy's phone, her credit cards
We will organize searches, put up flyers
We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow
You're having a press conference
I wanna get the word out, right
Yeah, it's just all of a sudden, I feel like I'm on a law & order episode
Time is of the essence in these cases
But, that said, do you wanna wait and call a lawyer
Absolutely not
I just wanna help
So, you and Amy have been here two years
You tend bar..
I own the bar
And I teach creative writing at mvcc
No kids
Not yet
So, what does Amy do most days
A woman with all those degrees, what does she do
I don't know
She keeps busy
Doing what
She's a voracious reader
So, she's always got a book in her hand
Well, days can get long
I know a few housewives, that evening glass of wine starts coming at noon
Or prescription pills
Just last week, we had a soccer mom
Nice lady
Got her teeth kicked in over some oxycontin
Ever since that mall went bust, half the town is out of work
We cannot keep up with the drug violence
I'm pretty sure that's not it
Has Amy got friends we can talk to
No, not really
No friends
This whole town
She was very close with my mom, before she passed away
You know, we have a pretty serious homeless problem..
In our neighborhood
I think maybe you guys should check that out
We'll look into that
You got to the bar around 11:00 today
Where were you before that
Just to cross that out
Well, I was home
I left at 9:30, I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper
I went to Sawyer beach and read the news
Did you visit with anyone there
I kind of go to Sawyer beach for the solitude
So, your wife has no friends here
Is she kinda standoffish
Ivy league
Rubs people the wrong way
She's from New York
She's complicated
She's got very high standards
Type a
That can make you crazy if you're not like that
You seem pretty laidback
Type b
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type
God, I don't know
I'd have to look it up at the house
You don't know if she has friends, you don't know what she does all day...  And you don't know your wife's blood type
Sure you all are married
Maybe it's type o
Where are her folks
New York
Yeah
Can they get here time for this press conference tomorrow
Tomorrow
I have no idea
I haven't talked to them
You haven't called your wife's parents yet
You can't get a signal in this building
I've been in here talking to you
Call them, please, Nick
Now
Fine
Should I know my wife's blood type
No
I apologize, marybeth
I didn't know what was going on
Now I'm at the station...  And the cops are at the house, and it's serious and I'm calling you
There's a lot of things that are being juggled right now
I'm standing right next to detective Rhonda boney...  Who's the lead investigator on this and she's...  My motherinlaw would like to speak with you
This is detective boney
I wanna go home
I don't know why I have to be here
I don't wanna be here
I wanna go home
Dad
This is my father
What's going on
Really
You're Nick dunne
We've been trying to get a hold of you all afternoon
I've been right there
My wife is missing
Bitch
Don't
Your father wandered out of comfort hill after lunch
We found him walking route 79, disoriented
We've been trying to call you for the last..
I don't get a cell signal in this building
I've been sitting 20 feet away from you
Sir, please don't take that tone with me
Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch
Dad, stop
You wanna drive him home
I think that would be wise
Thanks
This voice mailbox is currently full
Fuck
Get your fucking hands off me
Thanks
Everyone told us and told us and told us..
Marriage is hard work
And compromise and more work
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter.
"When young Amy's hope did wane...  "She wandered here..."  Well, it's not true
Not for me and Nick
"...In search of Jane.
With us, two years..
It's just good
Austen
You were an alienated teen and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you
Look at that
My God
You naughty minx
Well, technically, we are supposed to fuck at the next stop
Yeah, in keeping with tradition
But I might be willing to bend the rules this once
God bless Jane Austen
I'm enthusiastic
Look at that
It's confirmed by the..
Thank you
Year two
Cotton
We had that joke that our sex was too good for ordinary
So, these are 2,000 threadcount...  we're so cute
I wanna punch us in the face
That's pretty great
I mean, that is pretty great
Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer
I don't need a lawyer
Here, I'll do this
Well, did they ask personal stuff about Amy
You know, they asked...  Why didn't she have any friends
What did you say
I said she was complicated
Nick
Everyone knows "complicated" is code for "bitch.
God
I feel sick
Thanks
It's so bizarre
It seems like the kind of thing that would happen to Amy
She always attracts...  drama
You can say it
It's just me and you
Just because I don't like to be around Amy..
Doesn't mean I don't care about her
Anyway, whoever took her is bound to bring her back
Detective
Excuse me
I'm noelle hawthorne
I'm Amy's best friend
Well, great
Where do you live, noelle
Five doors down
1032
Wonderful
I would love to talk to you
Can I come by in half an hour
Y'all know anything yet
I'm sorry
I got guys on the clock in here
But you give me 30 minutes
But that's usually bath time
Well, we'll talk in between shampoos
All right
So, what do you got
It was definitely blood spatter you saw in the kitchen
Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep
Not that weird, but that is awfully high
So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep
Well, okay
Interesting
What's that
House is rented in her name
Car's in her name
Credit cards, utilities, phone bill, all in her name
Even his bar's in her name
I don't know that that's so surprising
No
But it is humiliating
What you got
It's with her unmentionables
Well, we have our first clue
I have to take a shower
No, don't
You've been up all night
You wanna look like you've been up all night
Hey, be careful today, okay
That's a weird thing to say
Well, when you're upset, you bottle up
You can seem angry, like...  please don't say, "like dad.
Or else you swing into your momma'sboy charm offensive and that can feel glib
Perfect
I'll balance on the exact fucking edge of your emotional razor
Okay
Just be..

Hi, rand
Hey, man
I'm detective boney
I'm the twin
Margo
We played tennis yesterday, Nick
I just can't get over it
Marybeth, I am really sorry
I knew you never should have moved back here
We didn't have a lot of choice
We are all worried
We are all scared
But we are all here now
And we will find Amy, together
Should I just go first, and then you guys can say something
Good
As you know, my wife, Amy elliott dunne..
Disappeared from our home on the morning of July 5th..
Under suspicious circumstances
Louder
If anyone out there has any information..
Please come forward
Thank you
I'm rand elliott
My wife, marybeth elliott
Should I have said my name
Amy is our only child
She's bright, she's beautiful
She's kind
She really is amazing Amy
You know, there are millions of people out there...  Who grew up with her and care about her
We care about her, we love her
And we just want her back
Amy is a decorated scholar
She forged a successful career in journalism
She returned here to her husband's hometown...  And she made a life in her adopted home
Now, Amy needs your help
We're establishing a volunteer headquarters at the drury lodge
We have a hotline, 18554Amytips
And our website is www.Findamazingamy.Com
Mr. dunne
Mr. elliott
Mr. dunne, any signs of foul play
Mr. elliott, when was the last time you spoke to your daughter
Smile
That's all for now
Thank you
Amy is the kind of girl who attracts admirers
Right, Nick
Yeah, definitely
And we've had instances...   Where things got..
Scary
Do you know about desi collings
Yeah, I know all about desi collings
He was obsessed
He attempted suicide after Amy broke up with him sophomore year
We had to file a restraining order
This would be high school
Twenty years ago
But he recently moved to St. Louis
That's just two hours away
To be fair, he is from St. Louis
We also have Tommy O'Hara
This is only eight years ago, in New York
She broke up with him, he got very physical
She filed charges
What was the charge
Sexual assault, threat, battery, what
I only know it was bad
I didn't know this
Okay
Thank you
Anything more recent
Not that I know of
Hey, Nick
You got a minute
Yeah
Imagine our confusion
A missing persons case...  And in your wife's dressing room, we find an envelope marked "clue.
That's for our anniversary
My wife does these treasure hunts
I'm hoping you can tell me what this means
You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt
It'll help me track Amy's movements before she disappeared
Of course
Okay
"Although this spot couldn't be tighter...  "It's a cozy room for my favorite writer.
I know this one
Although this spot couldn't be any tighter..
It's a cozy room for my favorite writer
Afterschool meeting, don't mind if I do
Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two
Well, well
What does it say
Clue two
"Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover
"You'll be the spy, and I'll be his lover
"Let's head on over...  "To the little brown house
"We'll play hot, doting husband, sweet, loving spouse.
These yours
No
But you read the first clue
Randy Professor, naughty student
I blush
Me and my ex just swapped cards
Where's this little brown house
I have no idea
Hello
Nicholas dunne
Under my father's name, William dunne
My wife's first pet
Is this necessary
Can you just turn the bell...  yeah, I know
It's... it's..
It's "puddles," right
Or is it "poodles?
We're good
Hello, stranger
Fancy meeting you here
It's your dad's house, right
Are you following me
What you doing
Like you said, it's my dad's house
I come by once a week, make sure the place hasn't burned down
But it looks okay
I'll walk you out
You know..
I thought maybe this was the little brown house
From the clue
Nope
Still blue
Picture me, I'm a girl who's very, very bad
I need to be punished, and by "punished," I mean "had.
It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five
"So open the door, and look alive.
Bitch
Want to test your marriage for weak spots
Add one recession...  Subtract two jobs
It's surprisingly effective
Promise me we'll never be like them
Like who
All those awful couples we know
Those wives who treat their men like dancing monkeys...  To be trained and paraded
Husbands who treat their wives like the highway patrol...  To be outfoxed and avoided
I think I'm gonna be laid off
We're in a recession
If it happens, we'll deal with it
I'll probably be next
We have each other
Everything else is background noise
You are exceptional
My turn
My parents' publisher dropped them, and they're in debt up to their ears
That's terrible
And they need to borrow from my trust fund
How much
Almost a million
That's almost all of it
This is where you say, "everything else is background noise.
Amy, if you're laid off...  And I'm laid off..
I said I'd do it
Without talking to me
Well, it's..
Your call
Their money, technically
You know what
You're right
Everything else is just background noise
Hey
More games
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks
What's the laptop for
Laptoping
I see
You can give your parents $879,000 without talking to me..
But God forbid I buy a video game without getting your permission
You are spending a lot
You don't trust me
You don't trust my judgment
You certainly don't trust my intention
What are you talking about
That's the basic tenet of a prenup, isn't it
Why are you throwing that in my face again
Because it's easy to throw
Nick, I don't get it
I don't get why you're daring me to be someone I don't wanna be
The nagging shrew
The controlling bitch
I'm not that person
I'm your wife
I'm sorry
I just don't know how to do this
I've never not had a job
I flipped burgers, I painted houses
You'll get another job
Hi, go
What
Hold on
What
And suddenly..
Slow down, what is it
I knew everything was about to get worse
Okay, tell me what's wrong
Bless you, Nick
Father
Hey, tom
Mayor
Nick, good to see you
Good to see you
Hey, guys, hey
Jodie
Nick
Oh, we'll find her
You look like hammered shit
Thank you
You ever see that guy in the glasses before
Don't worry
We videotape everybody that comes in and out of these things
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...  Dogooders
Freaks
Hey, I meant to ask you
Noelle hawthorne
She lives on your street
Amy's best friend
I've never heard the name noelle hawthorne
She and her husband have triplets
Oh
Yeah, we might say hi to them on the street
But "best friend"
No
Excuse me, one sec
He acted like noelle was a complete stranger
Of course he did
Look, these two are yours
Oh, look
He's being a good guy..
So everybody can see him being a good guy
You really don't like him, do you
What's to like
This mailbox is currently full
Press one to...  Nick
I just wanted to introduce myself
My name's shawna Kelly
I am so sorry for your troubles
Thank you
That's kind
Are you remembering to eat
Well, a lot of cold cuts
I'm gonna fix you up my worldfamous chicken frito pie
That's very kind and very unnecessary
You have to keep your strength
Would you...  Say, "chicken frito pie!
You know what
Would you delete that picture for me
It's a nice photo
I know it is
But just do me a favor
Will you
Would you go ahead and please delete that picture
You just press...  What is wrong with you
Could you please not share that with anyone
I will share it with whomever I please
Dude
Yeah
Marybeth is pissed
Why
Marybeth
It's like you're the goddamn homecoming king
It was important to my mother that I be polite..
I be considerate, I be a gentleman
It looked like you were having fun
I am in a nightmare
All I'm trying to do is be nice...  To the people who are volunteering to help find Amy
You're right
And I'm sorry
My God, this place literally smells like feces
In your searches, did you find any golf clubs, real fancy
No
How about a brand new stratocaster
No, nothing like that
Well, all right
How big's that TV
It's not 65inch
No, it's nowhere near that
Okay
Kibble
Excuse me
He asked me to feed his cat
I saw some in the pantry
Detective boney, officer gilpin
Noelle hawthorne
I know y'all are in there
Would you please escort miss hawthorne and her children back out to the street
Detective boney
Just remind her it is a possible crime scene
Look at that pieeating grin, from a guy whose wife is missing
How are you doing
Terrific
How's marybeth
She's a wreck
And you
Awesome
Hey...  Have you told me everything
Of course
Everything
Why would you even ask me that
Ever since you walked into the bar that morning Amy went missing, you seem...   Off
I am off
Everybody's examining me and projecting their shit on me
All I want is to come over here, have a beer with you...  And not be judged
Can we do that
Of course
You know what I keep thinking
If mom were here
Yeah
Like I'm 12
Nick, mom would fix it
I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep
Love you
Love you
So, here's a strange, new sentence
I am a missourian
Bye, dad
No money, no jobs, no prospects
And then, we heard from go
Mama Maureen..
Stage 4 breast cancer
So, we moved to Missouri
I don't mind
I just wish he'd asked
Nick is happy to be home
But I don't know if he's happy I'm with him
I feel like something he loaded by mistake
Something to be jettisoned, if necessary
Something disposable
I feel like I could disappear
Oh, my God
I saw you on TV
Okay
It's so crazy
Yeah, I know
She just vanished
She's just gone
I've been so worried about you
Where have you been
I called you a hundred times
You gotta pick up your phone
Rehearsals
What
Godspell
My sister's asleep in the other room
I needed to see you
I know this is a bad idea
Can you at least tell me you love me
I do love you, but we have to be really careful right now
I've been so scared
Between rehearsals
You told me I needed to have my own life
I know
We need to stop
I need you
Touch me
Stop it
Come here
Sit down
Okay
Did you, by any chance, tell anybody anything about us
Even in texting, or on Facebook
Facebook
I use the disposable phone
You buy my presents in cash
I'm not stupid, Nick
I know, sweetie
Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office
I don't know
Maybe
They better be mine
Sweetheart, think
I don't know
I'd have to check my red panty inventory
Andie, I need you to take this seriously, okay
This is the last time we're gonna see each other, until...  Until when
Until it's safe
You were going to get a divorce
Never say that out loud again
Okay
I'm sorry
I don't wanna fight
I just wanna be with you
Andie, please...  That's all I want
I can't
It's our last time together
Let's make the most of it
Real quick, but then you have to go
My husband has come undone
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen..
But as it turns out, we couldn't
It means a lot that you came
We took a hit on the brownstone...  And I used the last of my trust fund to buy him a bar
So far, it's just costing money
Nick uses me for sex when he wants
Otherwise, I don't exist
We should go to outback tonight
That would be nice
Last night, I went from desperate to pathetic
I became someone I don't even like
The kind of woman I used to mock
You're out so much
I know
Stay home
I can't, I'm already late
Then, can I come
You would hate it
It's a bunch of my dorky high school friends
Do our code
No bullshit
I thought we weren't gonna be that couple
Okay, bye
Hey, I've been thinking
Yeah
Something positive
Maybe it's time
Now is literally the worst time
It would be a new start for us
And for me, I would have a real purpose here
A child is not a hobby
Not a hobby
An inspiration
We could have had this fight four hours ago
I'm late
I didn't know it was gonna be a fight
You really wanna be the couple that has a baby to save their marriage
"Save"
Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever
And you're gonna walk out the door now
Yeah
You're a fucking coward
No, it can't go on like this
Really
I won't
You won't
You won't
Why, it's not good enough for you
It's not even close
You stupid bitch
What scared me wasn't that he'd pushed me
What scared me was how much he wanted to hurt me more
What scared me was that I'd finally realized..
I am frightened of my own husband
You want me to call for backup
Nah, I'll protect you
Jesus
They ought to burn this place down
Seems like folks are trying
You really think this is anything
Cross it off the list
Hey, Jason
What's up, Rhonda
"...and dedicated to the proposition that all men..."   Have you seen this girl around here
Why do you ask
She was reported missing
"...and so dedicated, can long endure.
Yeah
I remember her
What did she want
Weed, pills
She wanted a gun
I told her it's not my thing
I felt bad, though
She seemed really desperate
She said it needed to be small, so she could keep it close
Are you sure this is her
You don't forget a girl like that in here
She was all in pink
It was Valentine's day
For Valentine's day, I thought I'd buy a gun
That is how crazy I've become
Nick wants me gone but he won't ask for a divorce
In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar, his only line of credit
The bitch with the prenup
I could go home to my parents..
But I'd have to tell them the truth
And I don't even know if I believe the truth
Can I really think Nick would hurt me
I'm being paranoid
Crazy
It's just..
I'd sleep better with a gun
Oh, shit
Wake up, baby
My sister's gonna come out here
Sorry to rush you
It's okay
Here
Let me help you
Okay
Just get that
Be very careful
I'm all right
Here you go
Promise me we'll talk every day
Okay, we will
Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy
Don't go crazy
Okay
You fucking idiot
You fucking asshole
You fucking lied to my fucking face
I'm sorry
How old is she
She's in her early 20s
How long
A year and a half
You lied to me for over a year
If I told you, you would have made me stop
It's so fucking small
You're a liar and a cheat
You're just like dad
How did you even meet her
She's one of my students
I thought writers hated clichés
I'm not a writer
"Boohoo, I got laid off
I guess I'll fuck a teenager.
It wasn't like that, okay
You have no idea how shitty it was with Amy...  How fucking terrible she made me feel
Flyover boy
I would get knots in my stomach...  Just coming home, knowing she would be sitting there..
Dissatisfied, before I even walked in the fucking door
This is so bad
If anybody finds out, you're totally fucked
Boney found a pair of panties in my office...  Where, occasionally, Andie and I..
I don't know what the fuck it means
Are they supertwat's
Her name is Andie
She's not entirely sure
So we are dealing with a 20yearold...  Who isn't sure where she leaves her undies
If they're not Andie's, that means that they're Amy's...  And she left them there for me to find
Nick, I was scared for you before, and now, I'm fucking petrified
We're having a vigil tonight for your missing wife...  And this morning, you're kissing your college girlfriend goodbye
Can you imagine
Have you watched television lately
Cable news is all over your shit
I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep
His wife's nowhere to be found...  And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting
Cute pic, huh
Who is that
Some fucking tragedy groupie
Who the fuck is that
I don't know
She was trying to give me a casserole
On the show today we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...  Patron Saint to wifekillers everywhere
Tanner bolt, would you actually consider defending Nick dunne
Well, let me just say...  As always, Ellen, thank you for such a warm welcome
But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne
Listen, just because this guy isn't walking around weeping...  That doesn't mean that he's not hurting
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath is a lack of empathy
But the truth is, you'd have to be a sociopath...  To behave normally in this situation...  Because it's the most abnormal situation in the world
Tanner, are you trying to tell me that this photo...  Is remotely in the realm of acceptable behavior
I'm so sick of being picked apart by women
You need to hire Tanner bolt
I don't deserve this
Innocent until proven guilty
That's exactly what you deserve
Go home, Nick
Hey, buddy
I can't believe we haven't arrested this guy
We're not gonna arrest anybody...  Just because some blonde dunce says so
Why are you going so easy on him
You got a crush
One, I am conducting an investigation, not a witchhunt
And, two, don't talk to me that way, ever
She was trying to buy a gun
We don't know who or what was scaring her, gil
Give me the update
No drug angles panned out yet, so cross that off the list
I talked to the nurses who care for Nick's father
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten, so cross that off the list
Hey
Hey
So, luminol lit up the kitchen like the 4th of July
Whoa
Yeah
The blood is profuse
It is Amy's, type b, and we should have DNA soon
Thoughts on a weapon
Trajectory indicates blunt force
Maybe a club or a twobyfour
She fell there, but I doubt she got back up
Amy's medical records come in
No, we'll have them later tonight
My wife says he's a killer
Well, if Tiffany says...  Hey
Hey
Thank you all for coming out
Hey Donnie, how are you
Rich, thank you so much
Hey
Thank you, folks
Thank you for being here tonight
It just means the world to our family
And to Amy
As you all know...  My wife, Amy elliott dunne..
Disappeared three days ago
And I want to implore anyone who has any information at all..
Please come forward
Help us
So hot
He is so creepy
I wanna say something, because I think some of you might be wondering...  And are too polite to ask
I had nothing to do with the disappearance of my wife
I'm cooperating with the police
I haven't hired a lawyer
I have nothing to hide
Amy is my soul mate
She is brilliant...  She's charming, and wise
I love you, Amy
Asshole
I love my wife..
So much
And I may not behave for the cameras the way they want me to...  And if they wanna punish me for that, that's okay
But I just wanna ask you in the media, please, harass me..
But don't harass the people of this town
If you need to mock somebody, mock me
Nick
But please don't turn this investigation into a circus
Where's your wife, Nick
Let the police do their jobs
What did you do to your pregnant wife
Did you tell them that, Nick
Did you tell them Amy was six weeks pregnant
Thank you for your support tonight
Let's find Amy
Go ahead, if you guys wanna say something
Gil, go, go
Nick, where are you going
Stop him
No questions right now
Thank you
Why are you running away
Don't run
Everybody, stay back
Guys, come on
You know better
Get off the grass, get down to the curb
Hey, gil...  On it
All right
All right, y'all heard her
No pictures
Hello
Hello
Fuck
You scared me
Want a drink
Did you know she was pregnant
I told you, noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy
She doesn't even know Amy
They look like pretty good friends to me
Look, I don't know
But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant
We have her medical records coming
Good
So, let's talk while we wait
Let's start over here
The scene of the crime
You see, we've seen dozens of home invasions
Dozens and dozens
This area right here, it looked wrong from the second we saw it
The whole thing looked staged
Watch this
And yet, they remained upright throughout this lifeanddeath struggle
I don't know
What do you want me to say
Did you do any housekeeping the day your wife went missing
No
Because our guys did a luminol test
And I'm sorry to tell you, but that kitchen lit up
Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick
A lot
Oh, my God
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up
Wait a second
Why would they mop up the blood..
If they're trying to stage a crime scene
No blood and no body suggests kidnapping
It tells us, look at people outside the house
Like these homeless you keep mentioning
A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide
It tells us to look at people inside the house
Which is what we're doing here, Nick
I see
So, how was your marriage, Nick
Because right now, all we got is noelle
She says, "not good.
Gil, what do you and your wife argue about
What pisses you off
Money, lack thereof
Me and my ex, it's the same
I mention that because we got a look at your finances, Nick
$117,000 in credit card debt
What
I pulled up some of the merchandise
There are these fun little splurges
I didn't buy any of this stuff
I don't even golf
I do
You bought great clubs
I like the robot dog
This is identity theft
This is a felony
We need to find out who did this
All right
Let's talk about life insurance
Because in April, you bumped up Amy's life insurance...  To $1.2 million
Yes, I did
That was her idea
She wanted me to
You filed the paperwork
Because she told me to
Hold on a sec
Yeah
Okay
For sure
All right
She was pregnant
This is insane
So, my question becomes..
I don't want to talk to you again, ever..
Without a lawyer
Margo
Hey
Just hold on a second
Let me finish
Nick
I hear you, I hear you
I was as surprised as..
I know you're upset
I had no idea she was pregnant
Listen, I thought so, too, but evidently that wasn't...  you want to know the truth
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids
Well, I'm as surprised as...  you told me you didn't want kids
I was trying to put a good face on
Then, suddenly, you've got a pregnant wife
That's a problem for you
Especially when you factor in the secret teenage girlfriend
Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott
You have to fucking talk to me
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids because she didn't want me to
Because it would have just been another reason for you to hate her
And we had enough of those already
It was easier to just...   lie to me
I wanted kids
When we first moved here, I went to a fertility clinic
It didn't work
I did my part
Masturbate
When it came time for Amy to do her thing, all of a sudden it was like...  "Well, I don't know
Maybe
No, thanks.
Now, who would believe you
All right
This is a letter from the clinic...  Notifying me that they're gonna destroy my sample..
Unless I contact them
So, I gave it to Amy
The next day, I saw it in the trash
But you were already with Andie by then, right
I wanted a baby with Amy
A year ago, Amy being pregnant would have been the best thing ever
"When your poor Amy has a cold, this dessert just..."  this is the clue you couldn't solve
Yeah
A letter from desi
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's
It was the fucking rich guy who would do anything for her
It just kept hanging over my head
It was disgusting
Your prenup
Nick, why have you kept this stuff
It's like a little box of hate
I don't know, go
Maybe I hate her
I love you no matter what
But you need to tell me
Tell you what
What are you asking me
Are you asking me if I killed my wife, go
Is that what you're asking me
If I murdered my wife
I would never ask you that
Margo
Don't walk on the glass
You have no clue, do you
Why was he here that night
His wife is missing
Why come here
Who cares
Rhonda, we got this
Let's make the arrest
Do you know how hard it is to make a murder case without a body
No
Well, it's incredibly hard
So, I want one last thing
What's that
I want a body
Picture me
I'm a girl who's very, very bad
Be careful
I need to be punished, and by "punished," I mean "had.
Fuck
It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five
So, open the door...  Punish
Wood
Beach
And look alive
Punish
Wood
Wood
I will practice believing my husband loves me...  And will love this baby
That this child might really save our marriage
But I could be wrong
Because sometimes..
The way he looks at me..
I think...  Man of my dreams...  Father of my child..
This man of mine may kill me
He may truly..
Kill me
Wtf
I am so much happier now that I'm dead
Technically, "missing.
Soon to be presumed dead
Gone
And my lazy, lying, cheating, oblivious husband...  Will go to prison for my murder
Nick dunne took my pride and my dignity...  And my hope and my money
He took and took from me until I no longer existed
That's murder
Let the punishment fit the crime
To fake a convincing murder, you have to have discipline
You befriend a local idiot
Harvest the details of her humdrum life
And cram her with stories about your husband's violent temper
Secretly create some money troubles
Credit cards, perhaps online gambling
With the help of the unwitting...  Bump up your life insurance
Purchase getaway car
Craigslist
Generic
Cheap
Pay cash
You need to package yourself so that people will truly mourn your loss
And America loves pregnant women
As if it's so hard to spread your legs
You know what's hard
Faking a pregnancy
First, drain your toilet
Invite pregnant idiot into your home...  And ply her with lemonade
Steal pregnant idiot's urine
Voilà
A pregnancy is now part of your legal medical record
Happy anniversary
Wait for your clueless husband...  To start his day
Off he goes
And the clock is ticking
Meticulously stage your crime scene...  With just enough mistakes to raise the specter of doubt
You need to bleed
A lot
A lot, a lot
A head wound kind of bleed
A crime scene kind of bleed
You need to clean poorly...  Like he would
Clean and bleed
Bleed and clean
And leave a little something behind
A fire in July
And because you're you...  You don't stop there
You need a diary
Minimum, 300 entries on the Nick and Amy story
Start with the fairy tale early days
Those are true
And they're crucial
You want Nick and Amy to be likeable
After that, you invent
The spending
The abuse
The fear
The threat of violence
And Nick thought he was the writer
Burn it just the right amount
Make sure the cops will find it
Finally, honor tradition with a very special treasure hunt
And if I get everything right, the world will hate Nick...  For killing his beautiful, pregnant wife
And after all the outrage, when I'm ready..
I'll go out on the water with a handful of pills...  And a pocket full of stones
And when they find my body, they'll know...  Nick dunne dumped his beloved like garbage
And she floated down past all the other..
Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women
Then, Nick will die, too
Nick and Amy will be gone
But, then, we never really existed
Nick loved a girl I was pretending to be
"Cool girl.
Men always use that as their defining compliment
"She's a cool girl.
Cool girl is hot
Cool girl is game
Cool girl is fun
Cool girl never gets angry at her man
She only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner...  And then presents her mouth for fucking
She likes what he likes
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster who loves fetish manga
If he likes girls gone wild, she's a mall babe...  Who talks football and endures buffalo wings at Hooters
When I met Nick dunne, I knew he wanted cool girl
And for him, I'll admit, I was willing to try
I waxstripped my pussy raw
I drank canned beer watching Adam sandier movies
I ate cold pizza and remained a size two
I blew him semiregularly
I lived in the moment
I was fucking game
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it
Nick teased out of me things I didn't know existed
A lightness, a humor, an ease
But I made him smarter
Sharper
I inspired him to rise to my level
I forged the man of my dreams
We were happy pretending to be other people
We were the happiest couple we knew
And what's the point of being together if you're not the happiest
But Nick got lazy
He became someone I did not agree to marry
He actually expected me to love him unconditionally
Then he dragged me, penniless, to the navel of this great country...  And found himself a newer, younger, bouncier..
Cool girl
You think I'd let him destroy me and end up happier than ever
No fucking way
He doesn't get to win
My cute, charming, saltoftheearth, Missouri guy
He needed to learn
Grownups work for things
Grownups pay
Grownups suffer consequences
Wait
I need 20 seconds where you don't judge me, interrupt me...  Or get angry
Okay
Is that all the stuff from the credit cards
Where do you store goodies for anniversary five
Wood
Woodshed
Yeah, my woodshed
That fucking bitch
I thought..
It's all right
I would have, too
What's that present
I don't know
Let's find out
"Dear husband, I know you think you're moving through this world unseen
"Don't believe that for a second
"I know where you've been, and I know where you're going.
"For this anniversary, I've arranged a trip
"Follow the river, up, up, up
"Sit back and relax, because you are done.
What's "up, up river"
"Up the river.
Prison
Fucking crazy bitch
That's what this is
She's framing me for her murder
You married a complete psychopath
The morning of our anniversary..
I was gonna ask her for a divorce
I just couldn't do it
I couldn't fake it for another year, another day
Then what happened
Before I could say anything, she said...  "I need you to go somewhere and really think about our marriage.
She knew I would go to Sawyer beach
So you'd have no alibi
She stagemanaged me
She knew exactly what I would do
And I fucking did it
I went to the beach, I thought about our marriage
I came back and decided I wanted a divorce
And by the time you got home...  she was gone
You fuck
She's good
Part of me was relieved..
When I thought she was gone
Punch and Judy puppets
Remember, he beats Judy to death and kills that baby
So I'm punch
We already knew that, Amy, what's your point
Does Missouri have the death penalty
Hey, neighbor
It's been weeks since I had anyone decent next door
Well, I don't know how decent I feel
As long as you don't own a python and blast death metal at 4 am...  We're gonna be best friends
All right
Nice meeting you
I'm greta
I'm Nancy
Are you going to the marina
I could use some creamer
I'm sorry
I can't
I've got work to do
All right
See you around
You will
Come on
Show me that darling Nicky smile
You asshole
Hey
Nancy
Nancy
It's hot again today
So, where are you from
Let me guess
Nebraska
New Orleans
You know, I am an expert oiler
Oh, I just bet you are
Lotions and balms
Ointment
I would hate for y'all to get tan lines
So sweet
Okay
You know where I'll be
I see we have the same taste in men
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet
Least you could do is not keep his secrets for him
Let me guess
He's trying to watch the big game and you just won't shut up
No, you don't seem like much of a talker
I got it
You caught your boy rubbing up on some hot little skank...  And he apologized to you by busting you a good one
Worse
Worse
I went to the bar where he works to surprise him
And out he comes with this girl who had no business being in a bar
On the very first night that we met...  We walked by a bakery that was having their sugar delivered
And it was in the air, everywhere
A sugar storm
And before he kissed me..
He leaned in...  And did this
And guess what
What
He did the exact same thing with her
That is the most disgusting thing I ever heard
Thank you
Thanks very much
Well, we've gone mainstream
It's an appeals process, so we will attempt to appeal to them
Mr. bolt
Tanner bolt
Nick dunne
I have been sitting by the phone, my friend
I'm sorry
Do you not believe me
No, I believe you
It's just the craziest thing I've ever heard
I love it
But, for you, it sucks
But you gotta have a grudging respect for your wife at this point, right
Are you laughing me out of the building
No
Are you kidding me
I'm in
I'm way in
You came to the right guy
This is what I do, Nick
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer
I win the unwinnable cases
$100,000
We'll figure something out
I'll give you a special...  "My wife is skilled in the art of vengeance" rate
Okay
So, what's the plan
Well, right now, it's a "he said, she said.
She's telling a better story
No, Nick
She is telling the perfect story
So, we need to start today to prepare your defense, should we need it
And if we decide to go with your version of...  the truth
Then we'll need to realign the public's perception of Amy
Make them stop seeing her as America's sweetheart...  And see her for what she is, which a mindfucker of the first degree
Now, that is a huge realignment
We'll need other voices besides yours
There has to be someone out there that she's screwed with in the past
There's a New York guy
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara
Eight years ago, she pressed charges against him
That should be easy to find
Exclassmate, desi collings
She said that he stalked her
He's in St. Louis
You go talk to Tommy, and I'll draw up the contract
I told you, you came to the right guy
Apparently
Tommy
Yeah
Thanks for seeing me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're gonna want a drink
Yeah
So, she said you got physical with her
No, dude, she said I raped her
First degree, felony rape
Did you do it
Did you do it
I was looking at 30 years to life
Did you get a trial
Fuck, no
Do I look like I would do well in the yard
I pled down, man
Sexual assault one, no jail time
That's something
Oh, yeah
I've been unemployed for the last eight years...  Because I have to write "sexual offender" on every job application
I'm on a neighborhood watch list, because I have to register as a predator
I haven't had a date in almost a decade, because if a girl googles me...  Could you walk me through what happened
I meet Amy at this party, you know
We click
She's perfect
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's wellread...  She's got an ass like a 20yearold stripper
I think, "what's the catch?
A few months, it hits me
This is not going to be easy
Girls like a fixerupper, but Amy
She annexed me
She made me her business
It was just too much
She went out and bought me ties
And we must have gone 20 rounds over that
Ties
The whole thing just became...   so, you broke up with her
No, I just backed away
Gave her some space
No big deal, right
So I thought
Then one night, Amy comes over to my place...  With a bottle of bourbon and a bootleg of this band I love
And within two minutes, she's got my pants around my ankles...  And she is kneeling down, and..
I'm sorry
I know it's your wife
You had sex
Yeah, consensual
It was rough, but she was screaming for it
Next morning, there's two cops at my door
Amy has wounds that are consistent with rape
Ligature marks on her wrist, and my semen
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed, and raped her
Me
And then, guess what they find
Headboards of my bed, one on each side
The ties you wouldn't wear
You do know your wife
Did you ever see her again
Yeah
On TV, last week, with you
I thought, "there's Amy
"She's graduated from being raped to being murdered.
You been watching this, too
Last night's bombshell
We just found out...  Amy elliott dunne was, indeed, pregnant when she went missing
Kelly capitono, this makes me wanna throw up
What is it about a pregnant woman, a woman carrying life inside her...  That turns men into animals
Ellen, this is an epidemic
The third leading cause of death among pregnant women...  Is homicide committed by a boyfriend or husband
Let's not forget about the wife, ever
Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend, noelle hawthorne
Thanks for being on the show, noelle
Thank you, Ellen
And let me just say this...  Amy would have loved you, and all you do for women
Oh, that's nice
Why don't you tell us about your friend, noelle
Amy was so nurturing
Oh, I'd love if just once, someone was like...  "She was a real rag.
She was beautiful and smart and kind
Seems like a rich bitch to me
What do you mean
People love her
I don't know
She seems uppity
Spoiled rich girl, married a cheating asshole
Paid the ultimate price
The only secret was her husband
We never met Nick
He never introduced himself
Why was that, noelle
Why do you think
I think we know why
Because he had a violent temper
A little harsh
That's life, baby
He knew I'd have seen right through him
Don't get me wrong
I'm not saying it's okay he killed her
I'm just saying, there are consequences
Fuck, yeah
She was so alone
And she was so innocent
You're a good friend, noelle
And you're a good friend of the show
Thanks for coming on
Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt
Tanner bolt landed me
I'm gonna try and see desi collings on my way home
And, go...  Tanner's retainer is $100,000
That's just the retainer
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings
I've got $2,500 in an ira
I'm approved for a second mortgage on the house
We will go from there
Thank you
I love you
I love you, too
Nick keeps his father, who has Alzheimer's, in a facility
Number of times he visited last year
One
Oh, fuck
His twin sister, margo, well, she is a peach
These two spend their days in the bar Amy bought them
Playing what, Lauren
Playing house
What the fuck
Twin siblings often enable and abet
While I never examined Nick, or his sister..
They both seem very, very close
It's twincest
Disturbingly close, Lauren
And so, we close with a question
What kind of moral rot..
Allows a beautiful, talented, kind, smart, loving mother...  To vanish without the heavens hearing our outraged cries
Can I bum a cigarette
Amy elliott dunne, we care about you, and we will not forget
And you know what else we won't forget
Missouri has the death penalty
Amen
I'd like to report some strange activity...  Near the woodshed on the property of one margo dunne
Hey
Mr. dunne
Mr. collings
I know you
I saw you at the volunteer center
I wanted to help
I hope you don't mind me coming by
I got your address from this letter that you wrote my wife
Amy and I believe in the lost art of letterwriting
I always wondered why you kept in touch after...  Everything
You were together for two years in boarding school, right
She was my first serious girlfriend
Why did you break up
That's a strange question
Did you treat her bad
Did you cheat on her
That's a rude question
Let me tell you what Amy told me
She dumped you, you completely unraveled
You stalked her, you threatened her...  And you attempted suicide in her bed and were institutionalized
Your wife is missing, and you came all this way to tell me this
I thought there might be another side to this story
Mr. collings
Fuck
The missing persons case of Amy elliott dunne
She is the beautiful blonde inspiration for the amazing Amy kids' book series
You're reading that diary again
You know how it ends
It interests me
Hey, Rhonda
"He's gonna kill me.
The end
Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it
It's private
There's no one there
Why didn't he make sure it actually burned
Because he tripped the alarm
You were up his ass with a flashlight
The whole thing just feels hinky
Like finding an envelope marked "clue.
You ever hear the expression...  "The simplest answer is often the correct one"
Actually, I've never found that to be true
Good night
Good night
Hey
Elvis is in Missouri
Thank God
Come on in
First thing you have to understand about Amy, she loves to teach lessons
Play God
Yeah, old testament God
Okay
Keep talking
She finds out I've been cheating on her with Andie..
Decides to teach me a lesson
Fakes her own death, frames me for it
Blood in the house, credit cards, life insurance
She does the treasure hunt
Now, the treasure hunt is critical
She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities
Rubbing my nose in it
And she leaves clue number one for the police..
Which will lead them back to my office..
Which is a place where Andie and I would often...  And she leaves a pair of red panties
Right
Racy, looks bad
Clue two
My father's house
Another place where Andie and I would occasionally have relations
Clue three
Woodshed
Also a location...  Oh, my God
We had limited options
A hotel
Amy would have seen the credit card bill
Put it on Andie's credit card
Andie's statement went right to her parents
Nick, margo, can we head over to the little brown house
This leads us to what
My dad's house
Dad's house is blue
After the divorce, when dad wasn't coming around..
I used to pretend that he was a spy named Mr. brown, who...  For the sake of his children's safety, had to deny their existence
You never told me that
You told her that
We've got incriminating red panties in your office
We've got a showcase showdown worth of crap in your woodshed
So, what in God's name is at your father's house, Nick
And be honest
I honestly have no idea
Whatever they found, I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad
We got a lot of uncontained issues here
Nick, do you have any idea as to what Andie's mindset is
We haven't communicated since the vigil
Okay
Amy's parents
No, it's...  More pressure
We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will no doubt go public at any moment
No, Andie won't do that
She will
They always do
Don't take it personally
Amy's got us in an interesting bind
We need to tell the cops about Andie
Really
Right now, Andie just gives you another motive
We need to tell the cops about the woodshed
We need to be on the front end of that
But I'm gonna warn you as to what will happen
They'll go after margo
They can't do that, can they
She's your accomplice
She helped you hide the evidence
In all likelihood, she knows that you killed Amy
God
Well, what are we going to do
We find Amy
No
Any other strategy is missing the point
I've got two exsecret service guys that are really good
I'll put them on it
But where do they start, Nick
Where would Amy go
I have no idea
Are we keeping score
Hey
I thought we were steering clear of men for a while
He's nice
Because he wants to fuck you
She's still moping about her ex
He got cheated on, too
We three are the saddest sacks in all the ozarks
I'm not sad
I'm angry
There you go
I almost drank myself to death when my wife left me
I was gonna kill myself
Can you believe that
Don't give him the pleasure
I was going to drown myself in the Gulf of Mexico...  Let myself be dinner for the great whites
Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins
Why should I die
I'm not the asshole
Please put that on a tshirt
Miss moneybags
I thought you said you were broke
That's a fat wad
It's mostly singles
Singles
What are you, a stripper
Swamp girls, or treasure chest
We're just teasing
Don't they tease people down in nola
We can expect Nick dunne's arrest any day now
We've got blood in the house, huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy
And we have Amy elliott dunne, missing for five days..
Crying out for justice
We'll be right back
Tanner has a very bad idea he's going to pitch you
Yeah
You're doing Sharon schieber tomorrow in St. Louis
It could go so wrong
And you are going to tell her about Andie
Nope
That sounds like a very bad idea
You haven't heard from her in three days
This is a ticking time bomb
You've gotta throw yourself on it
People are gonna hate me
And then, they will forgive you
A guy admitting that he's a gigantic asshole on television
People empathize with that
Why don't we just put out a statement
They need to see you
Sharon's specials, they get 10 million viewers
She is a crusader
If she takes you on as a cause...  she's going to ask real questions
I will drill you as if you were doing a deposition
What to say, what not to say
A trained monkey
A trained monkey who doesn't get the lethal injection
Nick, this case is about what people think of you
They need to like you
Now, you do this and you will reach millions of those people
Maybe I only need to reach one
Hello
Hey, baby
One minute
Hey
Hey
You clearing out
No, I'm just cleaning up
Let us come in and say goodbye
I'll come by before...  let us give you a hand
Yeah, you gotta clear everything out, here
Dorothy is a real stickler
Not even a spare hanger can you leave behind
Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside
A sock...  Or undies or what have you
You did a real good job
Where is the money, sweetheart
Look under her dress
He talked you into this
I talked him into it
The second you leave, I'm calling the cops
Your glasses are fake
Your hair's dyed all hamster
You say your name's Nancy, but you don't even answer to it half the time
You're hiding
I don't know why, and I don't really care
But you ain't gonna call the cops
And I don't think you've ever really been hit before
Holy shit
Sorry, but we really need the money
Next place, be more careful, okay
There are a lot of people out there a lot worse than we are
Excuse me
You can't sleep here
I did not kill my wife
Why don't you try it again
A little less wooden
I didn't kill my wife
What are you doing
Every time you look smug...  Or annoyed or tense, I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear
That's supposed to make me less tense
Let's try it again
Mr. dunne, from what I understand, you and your wife had some bumps
Yeah, we had some tough years
I lost my job
You both did
We both lost our jobs
I had to move back home so we could take care of my mother...  Who was dying of cancer and my dad, who had...  your dad's scorched earth
Let's talk about your mom, how close you were
Go on
For a while, things had been building up
"Built up" implies that an explosion is coming
No
At a certain point, we got on the wrong track
I had a moment of weakness
Your "moment" was over 15 months
I disrespected my wife
And I disrespected my marriage
And I'll always regret it
That works
Don't be afraid to play up the dufus husband thing, Nick
"I was an idiot
I'm a fuckup
"Everything I do is wrong.
I know
What men are supposed to do in general
Thank you
How do you feel
I feel good
Go, can you pass me that box, please
It's Amy's 33rd birthday present to me
You hate that watch
No, go
I love that watch
Just like I love this tie
Just like I love my wife
It's you
It's you
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Good God
Last week..
I threatened to leave, and he said he'd find me and he'd kill me
So, I disappeared
I lost the baby
I couldn't even tell my parents
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid
Well, he is looking for you
He showed up on my doorstep three days ago
He tracked me from my letters to you
You saved them
Knowing you were out there...  Was the only thing that's kept me going these past few years
Let's go to the police
You can explain everything
No, I can't turn up now
I'd be a pariah
Everyone would hate me
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison
He should go to prison for what he's done
I'm setting you up at my lake house
It's utterly secluded
Why are you so good to me
You know why
Excuse me
I know you, don't I
No
You're one of the nolan girls, right
No, we're from winnipeg
Excuse us
We should leave
Just a second
That was boney
I'll call her later
Tanner
Nice to see you
Sharon
Hi
Hope this is worth my while
You're gonna be very happy
Sharon
Ms. schieber
Thank you so much for doing this
Can I get you anything to drink or eat before we get started
No, I had some gummy bears
What the fuck
I'm sorry
We have a major shocking development in the amazing Amy disappearance
We go live to that story now
Oh, my God
You little slut
My name is Andie Fitzgerald
I met Nicholas dunne..
When he was my creative writing teacher at mill valley
Why is she dressed like a babysitter
I am deeply ashamed...  Of having been romantically involved with a married man
The girl with the giant cumonme tits
I truly believed we were in love
Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite
I know that is no excuse
No, it is not
I do not, in my heart, believe Nick dunne would have killed for me
My prayers go out to everyone who loves Amy
I apologize for the pain this has caused them
We have loved Nick dunne like a son
That love ended today
Come on, you're staring at ghosts
He met our trust with lie after lie
We now absolutely believe...  Nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter
Our amazing Amy
This just got very exciting
We need a moment
We're gonna have to bow out of this
Nothing has changed
Everything has changed
An hour ago, we were ahead of this
Now
I can handle this
We're on the defense
This is a completely different dynamic
I can handle it
She's going to eat you alive
Just trust me
Okay
Great
Mic him
One, two, three, four, five
Thank you
He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist
Yeah, no kidding
Roll tape
Five... four...  Three... two..
Seriously, I can't believe how fucking good you were
Amy brings out the best in me
Don't
Keep it together, you two
At least for the next 24 hours
People still hate you
Women want to scratch your eyes out
Andie was really good TV
She's a good person
Therein lies the problem
Ride this out...  And when Sharon airs tomorrow, we'll be looking at a whole new you
But, until then...  Don't show your face
No problem
Welcome
Make yourself at home
I've got music, satellite...  Netflix
He was her teacher
Roku
Internet, obviously
Here is a supposedly grown man...  if there is ever anything you have a taste for and you can't find it...  Just let me know and I will get it for you
Instead of the abc's, he taught her the birds and the bees
And just think how her mother must feel at a time like this
Wine cellar's downstairs
I'll get you some clothes, too
Not that I don't appreciate bait shop chic
The floors are heated, just dial to your liking
There's robes and towels
The shower has steam
The bathtub has a massage cycle
There's a great view, if you're in the mood
Blackout curtains if you're not
The bed is savoir
You'll never get a better sleep
This is just what I need
I'm so exhausted
I'll leave you to it, then
Amy, I am so happy that you are here
And I don't want you to worry for one moment
There are cameras everywhere
The exterior, all along the grounds, the entryway
Anyone...  Who is caught coming or going...  Will be recorded
You are more than safe
And I am not letting you get away again
Good morning
Don't do that
I'm sorry
I need to feel safe
You are very safe
What have you been up to
Nothing
Amy, I'm not Nick
It's hard for me
After so many years under someone's thumb..
I know just what that feels like
You were never under my thumb
On your leash
Never
A new start
Decent clothes
Hair dye
Makeup
Tweezers
There's a gym overlooking the lake
The sooner you look like yourself, the sooner you'll feel like yourself
I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch Sharon schieber, and finally move on
I think that's something I should watch on my own
Nonsense
I'll be back
And I am looking forward...  To my reunion with Amy elliott
Great
Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber
Tonight, exclusively..
Hurry up
A husband breaks his silence, not just on his wife's disappearance..
But on his infidelity, and all those shocking rumors
Nick dunne...  You're probably the most hated man in America right now
I probably am
And I probably deserve it
I bought that tie
Did you kill your wife, Nick
I did not kill my wife
I am not a murderer
But you were unfaithful
I was unfaithful
And I am deeply ashamed
And, on top of that, you allowed Amy's parents..
Her friends, all the people in your hometown..
Believe you were a loving husband, desperate to find his missing wife
Well, I am desperate to find my missing wife
You say that, but I'm wondering how you expect us to believe you...  Now that we know you're a liar
I didn't come forward with my affair...  Because I knew it would make me look really, really bad
But I don't care about that anymore
I just want to find my wife
I'm just trying to get clear...  Let me be clear
Just because I am not a murderer doesn't make me a good guy
I'm not a good guy
I was a bad husband to a great wife
I broke the vow that I made to her
Those are pretty words, Nick
But what does that really mean to you
It basically means that I was a con artist
I met Amy elliott seven years ago
I was completely transfixed
Amy can do that to you
I was this average guy from an average place...  With mediocre aspirations
And I met a woman who dazzled me
And I wanted her to love me..
So I pretended to be better than I was
When we got married, I promised to be that guy
That guy who works harder
That guy who, who lives and acts...  And loves with as much passion as she does
But I failed her
Instead of doing what was right..
I did what was easy
You talk like a man who believes he can make amends to his wife
Who believes his wife is still alive
She is still alive
Will you look at that camera for me
Will you look in the lens...  And talk to your wife
If she is out there, able to hear and see you tonight...  What would you like to say to her, Nick
Amy, I love you
You're the best person I've ever known
And I've taken myself to the woodshed for the way that I've treated you
And if you come back, I promise..
I will spend every day making it up to you
I will be the man that I promised you I would be
I love you
Come home
Here
Regardless of what you thought...  What does it say
I think we can all agree...  Oh, my God
You fucking killed it
There's more to him than meets the eye
They're going crazy for you
They disliked me, they liked me, they hated me
And now they love me
A candor and an honesty that's worthy of respect
He's certainly earned mine
What is it
I'm Sharon schieber
Good night
Margo dunne, this is a search warrant for your property
I usually ignore tipline calls..
But a neighbor was concerned about a strange man around your woodshed
Call Tanner
Okay
Fuck
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick
Is that what this is about
I have treated you more than fair throughout this entire investigation
I gave you the benefit of the doubt over and over
Every time you said something stupid..
I thought, "maybe he's just stupid.
But I was wrong
That's what this is about
Are these the clubs you don't play golf with
None of that is mine
None of this was put here by me
Those are nice clubs
You got the makings of a real man cave
Everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good
Nick
You can't do that
Of course we can
Amy, it's time to move on
What can I do to help
I need some time to think
That's the last thing you need
Desi...  twenty years, you have kept me dangling
Finally, last night, you came to me, and you chose me
Follow that instinct
Don't trust the instinct that left you beaten and homeless...  Sleeping in your car, fearing for your life
I'm not gonna force myself on you
I understand what you're saying, desi
I do
I've been so mistreated for so long
I've forgotten how to behave
I'll move in here tomorrow...  And we'll work it out together
I just want you to be you again
They only took margo to fuck with you
She's not spending another fucking second in there
I'm gonna go in, and I'm gonna tell them everything
What
We tell boney very little
Without a body, without a murder weapon...  Their only hope is a confession
So, you let them do all the talking
That way, we can jumpstart your defense
The truth is my defense
Recognize these
Yes
It's Amy's anniversary present to me
Was that how she told you she was pregnant, Nick
Mommy, daddy, baby, and that made you real mad
No
Recognize this
Never seen that before in my life
It's Amy's diary
We found this at your father's house
Is this your wife's handwriting
He's not a handwriting ex...  Looks like it
Our experts thought so, too
Do you wanna play a little true or false
Sure
"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips so he can taste me.
Yeah, that's true
You thought quinoa was a fish
That is also true, yes
She wanted to get pregnant, you assaulted her
I hit her
No, never happened
"Pushed," it says "pushed.
Absolutely not
I never touched her
She tried to buy a gun
I doubt that, but I don't know
Shall I read the last entry
Sure
"This man may kill me.
In her own words, "this man may kill me.
It's kind of a convenient end note
For future reference..
The truth, you are not a handwriting expert
Okay, I know
Judy's missing handle
Big as a twobyfour, right
Big as a club
We found this day one, in the fireplace in your home office
We didn't know what the hell it was, but fire in July
We bagged it
I've never seen that before either
We just tested it
Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick
So, finally, Nicholas dunne...  You're under arrest for the murder of your wife
Do not say another word
What about my side
Nick
More coffee
I'd love it
Remember that time we skipped school and drove to the cape
God, yeah
Lobster right from the ocean
This reminds me of that
Neverending holiday
You're not bored
Desi, how could I be bored
You can discuss 18thcentury symphonies...  19thcentury impressionists, quote proust in French
Nick's idea of culture was a reality TV marathon...  With one hand down his boxers
I really have to get going
But I will be back just as soon as I can
My keys
Thank you
That's how the kids wear it
Dunne
You got one hell of a lawyer
Hey
Are you okay
Yes
Are you
Yeah
Let's go
What does this mean
Well, you're out on bond
You can relax at home while we prep for trial
Keep your head down
Tanner, is there any fucking lead on Amy
I've got two of my best guys on it
She's air
Come home, Amy
I dare you
Mr. collings is home
Hello, Mr. collings
I've missed you
I've been thinking..
I don't wanna be without you
Stay with me
And when all this dies down, we'll go to Greece, like you said
Octopus and scrabble
How long do you think until it's done
Not long
Six months for the trial
Sentencing will be quick
He'll appeal
I can watch the rest overseas
Go slowly
But I want it
Don't rush
Just do it
Harder
You fucking bitch
Don't you worry, you're gonna have lots of babies
Her wounds are consistent with rape
There was semen present
We'll make sure it's a match
Yeah, it'll match
Thank you very much
What do you think
Are we pals again
Now that I know you didn't murder your wife, yes
What do you think
Kidnapping
The story's insane
She's on fairly heavy painkillers
It's okay
I want to help
Ms. dunne, I know what you've been through..
So we'll keep this very brief
Can you walk us through what happened
That morning, the doorbell rang
So normal
I opened the door
So strange
Since high school, he won't ever go away
And I've just tried to be nice to him
Answer his letters
Keep him calm
Oh, my God
I've encouraged him
You can't blame yourself
He pushed inside
And he grabbed me
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen
And he clubbed me
I collapsed
That club was actually the handle to a punch and Judy puppet
Right
Treasure hunt
I'd hidden some puppets at go's...  then how did desi have that handle
I'd just found it
It must have fallen off
I was holding it when desi pushed in
So, he got it from me
About that woodshed..
He took me to his lake house
Tied me to his bed
Back to the woodshed real quick
Real quick
When you went to place the puppets there...  Did you notice that it was packed...  lots of stuff
Corresponding to purchases made on credit cards in your husband's name
Nick and credit cards
He buys, I nag
I don't know, probably
He hid a lot of stuff at go's
They're very close
Now, may I go back to where I was being held prisoner...  By a man with a history of mental problems
Please continue, Ms. dunne
Desi assaulted me that night
Every night
He tied me up like a dog
And then, he'd punish me
Starve me
Shave me
Sodomize me
There were cameras everywhere
Please find this
Please find the tapes
She slit his throat with a box cutter
How did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter..
If he had her tied up the whole time
Can't you just be happy your wife is home and safe
Amy, we found your diary
It contains many concerning allegations of mental and physical abuse
Well, it's the ugly truth
Nick didn't want a baby
He has a temper
We had money problems
But I love him
Then why did you try to buy a gun
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading
If I could just clarify one thing...  if this case had been left in your deeply incompetent hands...  My husband would be on death row...  And I'd be tied, still, spreadeagle...  Ms. dunne, you've been very brave
We're finished
Now, I have to ask you...  Do you feel safe going home with your husband
We prayed to God, and God has answered our prayers
Amy dunne is home
Now, I know there are a lot of questions and concerns..
But for right now, we wanna sit tight...  And just be thankful and grateful for this miracle on the Mississippi
Excuse me
Excuse us, folks
We love you, Amy
All right, you can stop pretending now
I'm not pretending
You were perfect
The Nick I saw on TV, that's the Nick I fell in love with
You do know I was just telling you what you wanted to hear, right
That's how well you know me
You know me in your marrow
Okay
You need to tell me exactly what happened
Take off your clothes
I need to make sure you're not wearing a wire
You killed someone, Amy
You're a murderer
I'm a fighter
I fought my way back to you
You killed a guy
You slashed his throat with a box cutter
You went on national television and begged for me to save your life
And I obliged
But I want that Nick
I'm leaving
You really think that's smart
Shampoo
Wounded, raped wife battles her way back to her husband...  And he deserts her
They'll destroy you
Neighbors will shun you
And I'll make sure that no one forgets the pain you caused me
I don't want anything to do with your groupies outside
Once they go..
I go
Give it the night
Sleep on it
Was there ever a baby
There can be
Good night
Hey, Nick
Hello, handsome
Crepe
Sure
She was his dream girl
And when this spoiled, rich, entitled little boy couldn't have her..
He took her
You must be so proud
It's been four hours
Nick
Nick
What's next for you and Amy
Right now, it's all about our marriage
When two people love each other and can't make that work...  That's the real tragedy
Kiss my cheek
I can't believe that fucking spider is America's sweetheart
She told me she killed desi
Not selfdefense
Murder
Can't we get a wire
That's not gonna work
She told you once before
Yeah, because she had me strip naked, and stand in the shower
I swear, you two are the most fuckedup people I've ever known
And I specialize in fuckedup
You and Amy under the same roof
You should pitch that as reality television
Amy dunne, and the miracle on the Mississippi
Nick and I have been through some bad patches
We've had our dark days
But we thank you so much...  For supporting us in our new life together, for forgiving Nick
Really, your encouragement means the world
She's good
Amazing Amy and the humbled husband
The real housewives of branson
Take care of this guy, will you
I can't believe you're just leaving now
You are not at risk anymore
I'm the definition of "at risk.
You got a book deal, a lifetime movie, you franchised the bar
You may wanna thank her
Just don't piss her off
See you, guys
Elvis has left Missouri
She had to have made a mistake
We need to check Amy's story, piece by piece
Nick, I can't do anything
We had the national spotlight on us, we stained the rug
The case is with the feds now, they're done
That doesn't mean you have to be done
It does
What are you doing
Couldn't sleep
Come on...  Let me tuck you back in
You know you can sleep with me, right
Yeah, it's just..
I need more time
I would never, ever hurt you
I do need you to participate, though
I need you to do your part
Okay
Everything you have heard about my wife...  Is a lie
She is a calculating, murderous psychopath
And I have been complicit...  Nick
Nick
Breakfast
Honey
We should hold hands
Not the entire time, but on and off throughout
"So, Nick, how does it feel to have your wife back?
"It's fantastic
"How many people are lucky enough to get a second chance at love?
"Fantastic" is a little flippant
"Amazing"
I need you to admit that you got the credit cards...  And that you hid all that stuff at go's and that you pushed me
I'm gonna need those three things to feel safe
You have to own this, Nick
Don't worry
I know exactly what to say
Nick
What a beautiful home
I so appreciate you giving us this time, Nick
You went on national television...  And told people that I murdered my wife
I go where the story goes
You implied that I had carnal relations with my sister
I didn't use the "I" word
I said you two were "extremely close.
You and a panel of nitwits diagnosed me as a sociopath
Icebreaker
To go with your robot dog
I'll go find Amy
She's downstairs
What is it
It's for you
Open it
I don't need any more gifts from you
Open it
I didn't touch you
You didn't need to
Bullshit
That notice of disposal
I have that
You threw it out
The notice, yes
I want a blood test
I want a paternity test
I love tests
You can teach those people to hate me all you want
I don't care
I am leaving you
I won't have to teach your child to hate you
He'll do that all by himself
You fucking cunt
I'm the cunt you married
The only time you liked yourself...  Was when you were trying to be someone this cunt might like
I'm not a quitter
I'm that cunt
I've killed for you
Who else can say that
You think you would be happy with a nice midwestern girl
No way, baby
I'm it
Look, you're delusional
You're insane
Why would you even want this
Yes, I loved you
And then all we did was resent each other, and try to control each other
And cause each other pain
That's marriage
Now, I'm getting ready
I can't watch you play house with that thing for the next 18 years
I can't just walk away
You could get custody
No, I won't
And you know it
It's gonna be my child
I'm not gonna leave it
You wanna stay
I have a responsibility
It's not about what I want anymore
You wanna stay with her
You're breaking my heart
Go, you're my voice of reason
I need you with me on this
Of course I'm with you
I was with you before we were even born
We've been through the darkness
We've come out, united
We communicate
We're honest with each other
Right
We're partners in crime
And
And
We're gonna be parents
My goodness
How exciting
Thank you
"What are you thinking?
"How are you feeling?
"What have we done to each other?
"What will we do?
I wrote it all down: 4,200 square feet, four floors
Perfect
Courtyard in back, southfacing garden
Perfect
Shouldn't we wait for the car service
No, we'll sit in traffic forever
Is that the listing sheet
There is no listing sheet
I heard about it this morning
It'll be gone by this afternoon   Well, how many more after this one
None
You know how tight the market is
Sarah, do you have to ride that here
Mom, we're in the street
Evan
One day you will learn to respect people's time, Lydia
You'll realize that the world does not stop and start at your convenience
Im so sorry
Im meeting Arthur Digby Laurence in 26 minutes...  ...and if you think he's the kind of man who tolerates tardiness...  ...you are sadly mistaken
You're a saint to wait for us
Thank you
Hello
Its kind of between a townhouse and a brownstone
We call it a "townstone.
Built in 1879, this is the middle of the house, the parlor floor
Here is the living room
Formal dining is in the back
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...  ...which was renovated in '94 with all the expected amenities
Sarah
There are two bedroom floors above
My God, it's amazing
Hey, kid
No scooter
I don't have to tell you this amount of living space is uncommon in Manhattan
Its got a yard
Sort of
It is in a bit of disarray, but then again, 21foot lot, 53 deep
It allows for an expansive garden
Working elevator
The previous owner was disabled the last years of his life
Highly unusual, the elevator
You will not find this in 90 percent of brownstones
Perhaps it's something of a fixerupper, but we anticipate enormous interest
Its a very emotional property
Shall we have a look at the rest
You should make an offer immediately
Can I see it first
There is nothing like this on the market right now
You can't move from Greenwich to the Upper West Side...  ...and expect to still have a house, a yard and a dog and cat, but here it is
Its got everything you told me you wanted and more
You'll have another family
You could have two
Its a fortune
Mom, it's not Barneys
You don't have to pay the price on the tag
He can afford it
It would be so lovely if I could show the property before I leave
Hardwood floors throughout, as many as six working fireplaces
This is the top floor
Two bedrooms
One at either end
They share one small bath
Originally, this would have been the servants' quarters
The previous owner kept a small nursing staff
I don't know if you have livein help
No, it's just the two of us
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, or what have you
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine, the financier
May I ask what you do, Mrs....  Altman
Actually, Im going back to school
Columbia
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals
I didn't realize you were Stephan Altman's wife
Yes, until recently
Master bath
Pearlstine's been in all the papers since he died
His kids are suing each other over the estate
He was a recluse
Rich, paranoid
Now they can't find half his money
I hardly see how gossip is germane to showing the property
Stop calling it "the property.
It sounds ridiculous
Walkin closet
Could the little one please stop that
Kid, no elevator
And we emerge in the master suite
That's strange
What
Is this room smaller than it should be
You're the first person to notice
On caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea
Its called a panic room
What
A safe room
A castle keep in medieval times
I've read about these
They're in vogue in highend construction
One can't be too careful about home invasion
This is perfect
The alarm goes off in the middle of the night
What will you do
Call the police and wait till Tuesday
Traipse downstairs in your underthings to check it out
I think not
Concrete walls
Buried phone line, not connected to the house's main line
Call the police, nobody can cut you off
You have your own ventilation system
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers nearly every corner of the house
This whole thing makes me nervous
Why
Ever read any Poe
No, but I loved her last album
What's to keep somebody from prying open the door
Steel
Thick steel
Very thick steel
Full battery backup, so even if the power's out...  ...it's still functional
Oh, my god
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he
Open it, please
And with kids like he's apparently got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide
Please open the door
That is highly inappropriate
Open the door, please
My room
Definitely my room
This is really dangerous
That door is a hazard
Not at all
Motion detector, like an elevator
The door won't close if it's blocked
There's another one at your ankles
It couldn't be safer
I know they'll take asking price
Its working
I hooked up the phone
Good for you, Mom
Hooked up a phone
579 what
3000
Patsy's Pizza
please hold
Hey
Enough
Mind the pizza
What do you mean
Our first night
I should've thought of something special
I like pizza
Fuck him
Don't
Fuck her, too
I agree
But don't
Don't you think this place has way too many stairs
You didn't carry anything up them
You never asked what I thought of this house
I didn't want you to tell me you hated it
I liked our old house
Well, so did I
You know what I was thinking
I was thinking we could stencil the whole bookcase
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves
Go ahead
Oh, damn
I forgot to set up that tour of your new school
Dad already did it
Im going with him on Sunday
Oh, yeah
So Ill take a cab and meet him there
Is that what he said
Isn't that what's so great about Manhattan
You don't have to drive me everywhere
Ill ride with you
Why'd you bring me here if I can't go anywhere on my own
That's it
I quit
Im not fighting with you till tomorrow
Come here
Its disgusting how much I love you
Tell me about it
Mom
Yeah
Its too dark
Better
That's better
"Bypass nonready zone.
"Bypass nonready zone.
"Shunt
Enter.
"Bypass nonready zone.
"Shunt.
"Enter zone number.
"Shunt again.
ln the morning I got to figure out how to turn this thing off
Go, go back
Do it
Come on
Come on
Jesus fucking Christ
Amateur
We got a problem
We need to talk
Its about time
Im freezing my tits off out there
Who is that
This is Raoul
Who the fuck is Raoul
Raoul is okay
Raoul has experience
Where'd you get him
Through some people
Open the fucking door
No shit
What is this
There's a girl on the top floor, a woman on the third
They're asleep
They're not supposed to be here
This is your department, Junior
They are not supposed to be here
Videotape
We're on videotape
We've been on videotape since we got here and the tapes are upstairs
14day escrow
You fucked me
14day escrow
That's almost 3 weeks
They should not be in for another week
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks
Business days
Escrow is always business days
Fiveday weeks always
Right
Im out of here
Just wait a minute
Wait a minute
We can handle this
Can we still handle this
Its just a woman and a kid
Unless Daddy comes home
He's not
They're divorcing
Daddy's banging some B model on the Upper East Side
Its just her and the kid
Now, can we do this
Yeah, we can do it
Not with people here
And not with me
Wait
Twenty minutes
She'll call the police
They'll be here before I unpack my bags
So, we keep an eye on her
Raoul can totally administrate that part
I don't want Raoul to administrate that
He's not even supposed to be here
Nobody gets hurt
What about us
What if she has a gun
Who are you
Im Raoul
You know we can't do this without you
This is still a good plan
Fuck that
This is a great plan
Its just got a slight twist
Yeah
Felony kidnapping
Thirty years
You make a lot of promises, don't you
You promise me, you promise your kids
No family
You're right
Its all fucked up
I fucked it up
Its not how it's supposed to be
But the fact of the matter is there's still $3,000,000 in this house...  ...and no one but you and l even knows it's here
Hey, I want that money
I want it
But you...  ...you need that money
Or have you forgotten why you're here
So let's quit dicking around, okay, and get this over with
Kill the phones
Top floor, little girl
l've got the mother
Give me that
You stay here
Nobody gets past
Wake up
Sarah
Get up
What did you do that for
Where are you going
What's going on
People
ln the house
They're in the elevator, heading down
Fuck
They're coming down to you
I told you
I don't hurt people
They're going downstairs
That room
What
The panic room
No, press emergency stop
Fuck
Coming back up
That's you
Shit
Go
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Damn it
Mother...  Shit
That's seven years bad luck
Shit
Tell me they're not in there
Oh, damn
It doesn't work
Its a different phone line
I never hooked it up
Now what
I can't hear a thing
What do you think they want
I don't know
Rob us...
I don't know
What do we do
We wait
What if they get in here
Well, they can't
They can't get in
Its not possible
Mom
I heard you
Do you feel okay
Yeah
You shaky
No
Chills
No
Please
Don't worry about me
He's got kids
What do you think he'll do
Hang out while the cops waltz in
Use your head
Here he comes
I locked the roof access
She's not getting down from there
Good
She could be in there calling the cops
Could she have hooked it up today
No
You don't just call up Bell Atlantic
She would've had to do it through Manhattan Security, my company
I checked the paperwork and the phone is not connected
You see
She couldn't have
I thought she wouldn't be here
He said she wouldn't
Fuck you
And fuck you
She is not supposed...  Do it
Excuse me
The police are on their way
She's lying
You're full of...  Its not an intercom
Its a PA system
I know
Im just scaring her
I suggest you leave before they get here
What
He's saying that we don't have a phone
How could he know that
Take what you want and get out
If only it were that easy
Some paper
I need some paper
Give me some paper
Hey, Zorro
You going to help us out
You got a piece of paper
What is he doing
I don't know
"What we want is in that room"
They're coming in here, aren't they
No, no
I told you
They can't get in here
What do you know about this room
What do we know about that room
Lets not tell her anything
Just a few details
We're not coming out, and we're not letting you in
Get out of my house
Say "fuck.
You fuck
Mom
What
"Get the fuck out of my house.
Get the fuck out of my house
Okay, I have an idea
She's a woman
Women need security
She won't believe you
She needs to know she's dealing with decent people and she can trust us
Conversation's over
What
She's not coming down
Shut up
Will you please shut up and let me think
Like that'll help you think
You know what
Fine
You think
What if she did call the cops
She didn't
She said it again, that she called the cops
If cops were coming, do you think l'd still be here
Okay, fine
Good, excellent
We all believe you
How do we get into that room
What is funny about this
Is this shit funny to you
I spent the last 12 years building these rooms...  ...to keep out people like us
Its all so ironic and amusing, okay
Now, how do we get in
We can't
You can't get in the panic room
That's the whole point
We have to get her to come out
And why would she do that
I don't know
But when she does, she can't get out of this house
We keep her here, we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...  ...and I don't want any help from Joe Pesci over here
They want to hole up in this house
Fine
We make it impossible for them to leave
And why would they come out in the first place
Im working on that
Are you okay
Yeah
Small space
Im okay
You can't wig out
I know
I mean it
I won't
You know, people never get buried alive anymore
I guess it used to happen all the time
Really
Yeah, I read that
And when did this happen all the time
Twenty, thirty years ago
What are they doing now
I don't know
They're locking us in
This is not happening
Sarah, calm down
You know what could happen if you let yourself get worked up
Sarah
What the hell are you doing
We're coming in from below
No, you're not
Even if you got through the concrete, there's steel
You won't even make a dent
We'll see
Hey
This is what I do
If some idiot with a sledgehammer could break in...  ...do you really think that I would still have a job
Don't get that in your eye
Neighbor
Help
Please help us
Call the police
Do you hear us
Help us
Help
Help us, please
Call the police
Shit
You guys just going to stand there
Why
What do you got, MacGyver
He can't get in here with a hammer, can he
Could you be any louder
Give me a hand with those boxes
Listen, goddamn it
Im in charge here
Now, what the hell is going on
They're going to get in here
No, they can't get in here
We're going to be fine
We'll be just fine
Oh, this is good
This could work
I was just thinking that we should do something like this
Open it
I just did
Open it some more
We're just sending them a message
They'll get the point
Honey, get down on the ground
Quit dicking around and open this fucking thing up
Don't be stupid
Quiet
We're trying to scare them, not kill them
What is it
Its bad
They're coughing
If they're coughing, they're going to die
Nobody is going to die, man
Will you please have the balls to follow through with something
Mom
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out
They'll have a hangover
How are we going to get in there if they pass out, Junior
Cut it back a little
They won't pass out, numbnuts
They'll throw up first
We can't get in if they're dead
Stay on the ground and breathe
Turn it down
Turn it down
Its too much
Don't you start up with this shit
Keep it down
Im turning it down
Keep his ass off of me
We're not killing anybody
Tell him to turn it down
Turn the shit off
No
Turn it down
Mom
Just a second
Get under this
Oh, my god
Fucking amateurs, man
Its my fucking idea
Shut the fuck up
There are people trying to sleep over there
What is that
Turn the gas off
Turn the gas off right now
Get back
Shit
God
Get it off me
Its okay
You fucking bitch
You fucking bitch
Im coming in there
Calm the fuck down
Are you okay
Yeah
Promise me you'll never do anything like that
I won't
They're moving
At least they're still moving in there
What
Talk to him
Please, man, give it a rest
That Morse code
SOS
Where'd you learn that
Titanic
We got to talk
Downstairs
No, no, no
Not you
Come on, come on, come on

Five seconds ago, it was a third....  Come on

Im the loving grandson who put in the time with the old man...  ...every goddamn weekend for two years...  ...talking to him, dressing him, walking him, feeding him
Are you done
No
Im the one the old man finally told about the safe
Im the one who found the guy who built it, and I convinced him to break into it
Wait a minute
What
The bedroom's empty
Where are they
Two of them, on the stairs
Where's the third guy
I left my cell phone by the bed
I earned that money
I will not let you jeopardize my fucking plan...  ...because you have a problem relating to others
Got it
If I don't come back, close this door
Just do what I say
He touches me again, Ill shoot him
Christ
Wait
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle, or can we get back to work
Don't take no tone with me, jerkwad
Ill shove it up your ass and snap it off
You're a bus driver, Raoul
You live in Flatbush
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard bullshit you just heard...  ...because I saw that movie, too

I got some news for you
Go
Go
Fuck
She got something
What did she get
No
Charger
She has a cell phone
No
All right, signal
Come on
Signal
I don't think they'll be talking on no cell phone from in there
Why not
You can't call out from in there
No signal
I didn't hook up this line, but I hooked up the main line
If we can find it, we can cut into it
I can't go to prison, man
Im not built for that shit
Be careful
Get the phone
It doesn't come off
Rip it off
Screwdriver
Phillips
Junior, when I asked you to cut the phone lines, did you cut the main line
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone in the kitchen
Shit
Strip this and expose the wires
What are we doing
I have no idea
Okay, got it
Yeah

Put Stephan on the line
Who is this
Its Meg
Do you know what time it is
Put him on the phone, bitch
It's your fucking wife
Move
Hello
You've got to help us
Move
There are three men upstairs
They broke in...  What..
He'll do something
No, he won't
He'll call the police
You don't know her
She won't let him
No
He knows that there's trouble
He heard me
He's across the park
That's why we got houses close to each other
Just in case we needed each other
He'll help us
He won't
Yes, he will
Im sorry
No, Im sorry
Why
I was trying not to tell you
What
Im dizzy and hungry
All she's got is Nyquil and fucking Midol
Looks like that gas idea didn't work so well
Whose fault was that
This is impossible
What's the plan now, hot rod
This is worse than impossible
This is unpleasant
Here, drink this
All right, drink lots of water
You dropped to the low 40s
We have to get your bloodsugar up
Can you hear me okay
Im just dizzy, not deaf
Great
Smart ass
That's excellent
Did you see anything in here
Any candy bars or something sweet
Let's check it again
Mom, I did it
We got to stay calm, okay
If we stay calm, everything will be fine
All right
Stay calm
You're making me nervous
Im sorry
What if I keep dropping
You won't
Ill figure something out
You know, he's right
There's no way we're getting into that room
What are you talking about
I just got to be honest with myself here
I don't need to be involved...  ...with anything so harrowing or perilous at this point in my life
You're giving up
Hell, yes
I don't need the fucking aggravation
Ill make an anonymous phone call
They'll find the floor safe
Ill inherit
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax
Fuck, Ill still put away 8 or 9 hundred grand and keep my goddamn hair
Take it
Go out and get loaded
Wait a minute
Say what you just said again
Say that shit about the money again, babycakes
When
Before
Yeah, before
Splitting the money in your head, you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand
What are you doing
That was after tax, which makes it more than a million and a half gross
So now you're a tax attorney
I'm out of here
Wait a minute
There's sugar in everything
Places you'd never expect
Like ketchup
Where else
Travel kit
Plus, you named eight people you got to split it with...  ...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks in the safe
A fuckup like you has got to get less than everybody else...  ...so now I don't know what to think
You're adding up money you'll never touch, buddy
How much is in there
Mouthwash
Saccharin
Hey, Im talking to you
Answer me
Fine
There's more
And when were you going to tell us this minor economic detail
It doesn't matter now
Its totally fucking moot
Why are we having this conversation
What were you thinking
How did you expect to get away with this
Did you think that l'd open that safe...  ...and then me and Raoul would wait while you picked out your share
What's the matter with you
You got us into this mess, and you were going to fuck us
You got yourself into this
You got the custody lawyers up your ass
Your eyes were huge when I told you about the gig...  ...so don't play innocent
Things didn't work out
Play past it
Mints
Sugarfree
Mints
Sugarfree
Im opening that safe
You leave, you get nothing
Its looking doubtful there, big guy
I will split the money with Raoul
But I don't ever want to see you again
Cops show up on my doorstep, we will know who sent them...  ...and we will fucking find you
Ill see you, Burnham
Later, Raoul
Mom
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street a couple of times...  ...think you know all about it
You don't know nothing about me
Sarah, listen to me:  Go to the corner
Shut your eyes and don't turn around
Okay
You should see the look on your face
What's happening
Don't move
Don't you fucking move

Stephan Altman
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan
What did she say
Don't know
Cut off
Phones are dead
Did you call anybody else
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan
No
He's telling the truth
Yeah
Yeah, he probably is
Because when I do this, people don't lie
What
What do you want
Get us into that room
I can't
Yeah, you can
You're full of ideas
You just got to squeeze one out
You want me to just make something up
You've got till the count of three
Then you end up like Junior over there
One, squeeze
This is ridiculous
Two, squeeze
I don't know what to tell you

Listen to me
She's got your gun
She's got your gun
Stop screaming
Stop it
I know you've got the gun
Put the gun down and step away from the door
You got to open the door
My daughter is very sick
She needs an injection
Do you hear me
Open the door so I can give her a shot
Or I swear to God, Ill kill you both
If I open the door, you'll shoot us
So give her the shot yourself
Give her the shot
Do you need this
Can you do this yourself
What happens if you don't get it
Coma

Fuck
Open it
Put the gun on the floor
And go all the way downstairs
And I'll give her the shot, all right
I told you to leave the gun
Shit
You fucking bitch
If you pull any shit like that again, I will fucking kill her
Do you hear me
If you step outside, Ill kill her
If I see a uniform inside this house, I'll cut her fucking throat
Do you understand
Yes
But please, just give her the shot
Please
Please
Don't fucking do it
While we're in here, she'll call the cops
Are you going to open the safe
Don't you look at me
All I know about this is what I see on TV
You got to talk me through this
This right here
Its this
Yeah, okay
Nice house you guys got
Your mom's rich
Dad's rich
Mom's just mad
Tap it
I wish I could have put my kid in a place like this
Its not that I didn't try
Sometimes things, they don't work out the way you want them to
Done
Wasn't supposed to be like this
He had it all worked out
Nobody was supposed to even be here
Thanks...  ...Burnham
Wasn't supposed to be like this
She's going to be okay
I gave her the shot
She's all right
It'll be over soon
Stephan
Oh, my god
Can you move
Not much
I think my arm is broken
Raise your arm
Come on, raise your arm
Try again
Come on
Try again
Meg, please don't do anything stupid
They're going to kill us
Just do everything they ask
It'll be okay that way
Stephan, they'll kill her
Holy shit
She called the goddamn cops
The police
You called the police
Of course, I called them
You scared the shit out of me
She killed the kid
She just killed her own kid
All right, take this
Don't say a word
No, her husband must have called them
Foreign son of a bitch
I told you
Where is she
There
What the fuck's she doing
She's going to handle it
Im just trying to unlock....   Is everything okay
You all right, ma'am
What are you.... What time is it
Its a little after 4:00 a.m.  We got a call, ma'am
Somebody called you
Can we come in
What do you want
We'd like to come in
No, you can't come in
Ma'am, you sure you're all right
Im fine
Ma'am, you don't look so good
Well, you don't look so hot yourself, Officer Keeney
Come on, Im freezing out here
"There are three.
What
Your husband said you called for help
That you said, "There are three" right before you got cut off
Oh, that phone call
And your neighbors...  ...called in about some loud shouts or a loudspeaker of some kind
That was the TV
Its off now
Can I just ask you one question
What was the end of that sentence
When you said, "There are three"...  ...what was the rest
Look....  My husband and I just split up...  ...and it's my first night in a new house...  ...and I admit I was a little drunk
And the sentence, if you insist on knowing...  ...was going to be:  "There are three things that Ill do for you if you come jump into bed with me.
Thank God I came to my senses before I said all that, and I hung up...  ...so nobody would ever have to know what I was thinking
Unless, of course...  ...two policemen came in the middle of the night and interrogated me
So, Rick, you want to go
Or do you want her to tell you which three things
All right
Ma'am...  ...if there's something you want to say to us...  ...but maybe you can't say it right now...  ...you might want to make some kind of a signal...  ...by blinking your eyes a few times
Something like that
That's something you could do safely
Man...  ...you guys are good
You mean, like if there was somebody in the house or something
They really train you guys
No, Im fine
Im fine
Cross my heart
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am
'Night, ma'am
This kid has seen my face
Yeah, well, that's not my problem
Yeah, it is
You're here with me
You're on the hook, too
Do one
Same price for the rest
Stay the fuck away from me
You know how this is going to end
Goddamn
What's up
Why the hell didn't we do that
What's she doing
What the fuck does she think she's doing
She's got your gun
Who told you to bring a gun
Just let me drill, man
Empty
Come on, man
Bank bonds
One second
Two, three, four, five....  Why are we doing this
Because it's going to come to that
There are 22

That lying little shit
Let's get out of here
Lift
Leave that
Christ, Ill buy you new tools
You'll be okay
Its glass
I got you
Come on
Hurry up
Watch the glass
Get down here
Wait
Wait
You don't want to do that
Dad, don't shoot him
Let my daughter go
We're finished
Your daughter's fine
We'll go out the back door
You'll never see us again

You'll be okay now
Police

Nobody move
Everybody on the ground
Team two, upstairs
Team three, down
Are you okay
Are you all right
Freeze
Don't move, motherfucker
Don't move
I will kill you
Move away from the wall
Get off the fence
Move
Put your hands in the air
It'll be okay
Its fine, Dad
Is there anybody else in the house
No
Central, I need a bus at 38 West 94th
Its okay
Im all right
I want to see the palms of your hands
Do you hear me
Open your hands
Dad, it's okay
You're going to be fine
Everything is going to be fine
This sounds interesting
"Twobedroom with den or third bedroom...  "...new kitchen, original bath, 70s East.
I thought you liked the West Side
"61st and Central Park West

I like the sound of that one
﻿1  TAYLOR: Neighbors heard them screaming at each other, like, for two hours
Nothing new
Then they heard the gun go off
Both barrels
A crime of passion
Yeah
Just look at all the passion on that wall
TAYLOR: Yeah, well, this is a done deal
All but the paperwork
The kid see it
TAYLOR: What
The kid
What kind of fucking question is that
We are all gonna be real glad when we get rid of you, Somerset, you know that
There's always these questions with you
Did the kid see it
Who gives a fuck
He's dead
His wife killed him
Anything else has nothing to do with us
Detective Somerset
I'm Detective Mills
MILLS: Lieutenant, l apologize for interrupting like this



..just get in town 20 minutes ago, they dump me here
Look, um... 
Mills
I thought we might find a bar somepIace
Sit, talk  I'd like to get to the precinct
You know, not much time for this transition thing
I meant to ask you something, when we spoke on the phone before
Yeah
Why here
I don't follow
WeIl, all this effort to get transferred
It's the first question that popped into my head
I guess for the same reasons as you
Or the same reasons you had before you decided to quit, yeah
You just met me
Maybe I'm not understanding the question
It's very simple
You actually fought to get reassigned here
I've just never seen it done that way before
I thought l could do some good
It would be great



..if we didn't start out kicking each other in the balls
If you're calling the shots, lieutenant Yes
I want you to look and l want you to listen, okay
Now, l wasn't standing around guarding the Taco Bell
I've worked Homicide five years
Not here
I understand that
WeIl, over the next seven days, detective, you'll do me the favor of remembering that
MAN 1 : Hey, hey
I almost died
MAN 2: Shut the fuck up down there
HelIo
Yeah
Okay
Say it again
I thought we moved here to get away from tractor pulls
Serpico's gotta go
Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid of this little crusty
This eye, Serpico
Did you get it
Got it
Good
Coffee
No
DAVIS: Nothing's been touched
Everything's like I found it
SOMERSET: What time was death established
DAVIS: Like I said.. 

.
I didn't touch anything
But he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about 45 minutes now
MILLS: Wait a minute
No one bothers with vital signs
DAVIS: Did l stutter
This guy ain't breathing unless he started breathing spaghetti sauce
MILLS: So that's how it's done around here
DAVIS: I beg your pardon, detective
But this guy's been sitting in a piIe of his own piss and shit
If he wasn't dead, he would've stood up by now
AIl right, thank you, officer
Okay
Thank you
I wonder
What exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into
MILLS: Don't know
How many times has Barney Fife found dead bodies that weren't dead
Drop it
Oof
Somebody phone Guinness
I think we've got a record here
<i>Better Homes and Gardens.</i>   Oof
Who said this was murder
No one
Guy's heart's gotta be the size of a canned ham
If this isn't a coronary, well, ha, ha, I don't know
Whoops
How about that
We had this case once
Guy dead on the ground
Knife in his back
Gotta be murder, right
Fuck
Anyway, big insurance policy involved, yeah
So the guy took the tip of the blade, stuck it in his own shoulder blades
And he must've screwed up a few times because there was multiples back there
Could you please be quiet
MILLS: Wait a minute
What
Got a bucket here
What's in it
Agh
Oh, God
Fucking vomit
Any blood in it
I didn't see any
Help yourself
Are you thinking it's poison
O'NElLL: Oh, wonderful
Very moody
Thinking it's poison, Somerset
You girls have got Forensics waiting outside
Don't know if we'll all fit, though
There's room, light's the problem
Hi, how are you
Hey
Detective Mills, would you go help the officers question the neighbors
What
Send in Forensics on your way out, please
He's dead
Thank you, doctor
You've seen my files, right
You seen the things l've done
Nope
I did my time on doortodoors and walking the beat
I did that shit for a Iong time
And
Badge on my belt says "detective.
That's the same as yours
Look, I made a decision
I had to consider the integrity of the scene
Couldn't worry whether you thought you were getting enough on the playing fieId
Hey, man.. 

..just don't be jerking me off, that's all I ask
Don't jerk me off
He's been dead a long time
And l can tell you, it was not from poison
MILLS: Oh, man
How does someone let themselves go like that
SANTIAGO: lt took four orderlies just to get him on the table
How'd the fat fuck ever fit out his front door
Please
lt's obvious he was a shutin
SANTIAGO: Now, Iook at this
See how big this stomach is
And the strange thing is, it stretches
Here
Look at the size of the cardiac orifice, where the food  Wait, l see what you're pointing out, but that means nothing to me
Okay
He's got lines of distention across the duodenum
And the interior wall is ripped open
This man ate till he burst
He didn't really burst
Not all the way
He was hemorrhaging internally
And there was a hematoma in the rectus and transverse abdominis muscles
So he did die by eating
Yes and no
What about these bruises up here
WeIl, I haven't figured that out yet
Gun pressed against his head
Pressed hard enough, sure
Fuck, yeah
Marks from the front side, flush with the muzzle
Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a homicide
SOMERSET: Killer put a bucket beneath him, kept on serving
Took his time, too
Coroner said this couId've gone on more than 12 hours
Victim's throat was swoIlen, probably from the effort
And there was definitely a point when he passed out
That's when the killer kicked him and he burst
Oof
Sadistic fucker, huh
SOMERSET: When you want somebody dead, you drive by and shoot
You don't risk the time it takes to do this
Unless the act itself has meaning
CAPTAIN: Come on
Somebody had a problem with the fat boy and decided to torture him
Simple as that
In the grocery bags, we found two receipts
That means the killer stopped in the middle
..  
..and made a second trip to the supermarket
So
Hey, man, it's his thing
I've been out in the rain all day
This is beginning
We've got one dead guy, not three
No motive
Don't even start that big brain of yours cooking on this, alI right
Please, l'd Iike to be reassigned
MILLS: What
CAPTAIN: What
What, whoa
What in the hell are you talking about
This can't be my last duty
It's just gonna go on and on and on
You're retiring
Six more days and you're all the way gone
Won't be the first time you've left unfinished  Those other cases were taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible
And if I may speak freely
CAPTAIN: We're all friends here
This should not be his first assignment
Oh, come on, I knew it
This is not my first assignment, you dick
It's too soon for him
Hey, man, l'm right here
You can say that shit to my face
Captain It's too soon for you
Captain, if we can just talk in private
This isn't working
It's a personal thing
Maybe Just shut up, Mills
Look, I don't have anyone eIse to put on this and you know it
This is Metro
You don't just get to swap
MILLS: Give it to me
Say what
Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him
Sorry, but see you later
Have a nice time
Give it to me
No, I'm putting you on something else
Go on, Mills
Just go on
I'm sorry, old buddy
But it looks like you're stuck cleaning up the fat man
TALBOT: All right, here we go
Quiet down
All right, calm down
Calm down
Quiet down
Calm down
Quiet down
Now, here's how it's gonna work
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes and 10 minutes onIy
If those questions do not come in a calm, sane and orderly fashion



.. l'm on my way out here
Detective
Detective
Can I have a moment of your time
No
I will not discuss the details of this ongoing investigation...  
..so don't even bother asking
MAN 1 [OVER RADIO]: <i>I've got shopping tools....</i>  WOMAN [OVER RADlO]: <i>That's 25 Berlin.</i>   MAN 2: That looks like him
WOMAN [OVER RADlO]: <i>Three items for your case number.</i>  What you guys got for me
MAN 3: Nothing yet, boss
Why don't you guys, uh, go get a coffee, huh
WOMAN [ON TV]: <i>We have this breaking story for you.</i>  <i>We're going to go live downtown...</i>  <i>...where defense attorney Eli Gould</i> <i>was found murdered this morning.</i>  <i>District Attorney Martin Talbot</i> <i>is taking questions from reporters.</i>   REPORTER 1 : <i>There could be a conflict of interest</i>  <i>That is ridiculous to the point of being</i> <i>offensive
There is no conflict whatsoever.</i>  <i>And any claim that there could be...</i>  <i>...is irresponsible.</i> REPORTER 2: Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot
<i>Hold on.</i> REPORTER 3: It's rumored you're far...  <i>...from apprehending a suspect.</i> <i>TALBOT: I've come from a meeting...</i>  <i>...of law enforcement officials</i> <i>and they've assured me...</i>  <i>...they have their very best men on this.</i>  <i>This will be the very definition</i> <i>of swift justice.</i>  CAPTAIN: Pardon me, George
Somerset
Come in
Have you heard the news
SOMERSET: Nope, haven't heard
Eli Gould was found murdered this morning
Someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death
Wrote the word "greed" on the floor
Greed
CAPTAIN: Yeah, in blood
Mills is heading up the investigation
Uh, excuse me
Excuse me
Could you not do that, please
Oh, okay
Well, good for him
What in the hell are you gonna do with yourself out there, Somerset
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm
Fix my house
Don't you feel it
Don't you feel that feeling
You're not gonna be a cop anymore
That's the whole idea
I don't think you're leaving
Hell, you can't leave all this
Guy's out walking his dog
Gets attacked
His watch is taken, his waIlet
While he's lying there on the sidewalk, helpless



..his attacker stabs him in both eyes
This happened just last night about four blocks from here
Yeah, I read about it
I don't understand this place any longer
It's the way it's always been
Maybe you're right
CAPTAIN: You do this work
You were made for it and l don't think you can deny that
Maybe I'm wrong
Oh, uh, the coroner sent this down for you
Found them in fat boy's stomach, mixed in with food
Looks like plastic, little pieces of plastic
Set them on the desk, please
They were, uh

.
They were fed to him
Oh, Lord
This was found on the wall behind the refrigerator.. 

..in the obesity murder scene
"Long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light.
It's from Milton
<i>Paradise Lost.</i>  All right, I'm confused
It means that this is beginning
This was found behind the same refrigerator
Written in grease
There are seven deadly sins, captain
Gluttony
Greed
Sloth, wrath, pride, lust...   
..and envy
Seven
Hold on
This is not even my desk
You can expect five more of these
Now, wait a minute
I can't get involved in this
Somerset
He wanted it
Damn
I'm aIl over it
MAN: What's wrong with you
Where you headed
Far away from here
SOMERSET: Thanks, George
GEORGE: How you doing
Just a few things to look up
GEORGE: Okay
Sit where you'd like
How's everybody
MAN 1 : Hi, Smiley
MAN 2: Come on, George, the cards are getting cold
Duty calls
Gentlemen, gentlemen
I'll never understand
All these books



..a world of knowledge at your fingertips
What do you do
You play poker all night
MAN 3: Hey, we got culture
Yeah, we got culture coming out of our asses
MAN 2: All right
How's this for culture
You know, Smiley

Fucking Dante

Fucker
Yeah
Good work, officer
Thank you, Lord
Oh, l'm sorry
Be out of your way in a second
You want your chair
No
You go ahead
MILLS: Yeah
Phone
It's a package deal
Comes with the office
MilIs
TRACY [OVER PHONE]: Honey
Are you okay, something wrong
<i>No.</i>  You dingleberry, l , uh, told you not to call me here when I'm working
Yeah
Why
Why
Why
<i>Come on.</i>  Okay
It's my wife
Sorry
She'd like to speak to you
Uh, this is Detective Somerset
<i>Oh, it's nice to speak with you.</i>  Well, it's nice to talk to you too
I appreciate the offer, but  Well, in that case I'd be delighted
<i>Great.</i>  Yes, thank you very much
<i>Thank you
See you later.</i>  Bye
Hon, what
WeIl
Sorry
Oh, uh
What
I've been invited to a late supper at your apartment
I accepted
At my How's that
Tonight
WOMAN [OVER RADlO]: <i>Twentyonefiftyseven.</i>  HelIo, men
Hi, loser
Hi, idiot
This is Tracy
Somerset
Hello
I'm very happy to meet you
I've heard a lot about you
Except, of course, your first name
It's William
Hmm, well, it's a good name, William
William, l'd Iike you to meet David
David, this is William
Okay, all right, I'm gonna  I'Il be right back
How are the kids
Good, they're in the room
Come on in
Oh, good dogs
How are you, good dogs
How are you, pretty
How are you
You are
SOMERSET: Smells good
What
Uh
Oh
Yeah
I mean, thank you
Um, please have a seat, if you Iike
Would you like something to drink
Uh, no
No, thanks
I'll wait
Okay, you can just throw that anywhere
You'll have to excuse all this mess
You know, we're stilI unpacking
I understand you two were high school sweethearts
TRACY: Mmhm
Pretty hokey, huh
You know something
I knew on our first date that this was the guy I was gonna marry
Really
Mmhm
He was the funniest guy l'd ever met
Really
WeIl, it's kind of rare nowadays, you know
I mean, that level of commitment
Oh, don't worry
I won't wear it to the dinner table
No, ha, ha
I, uh You know, no matter how often I see guns, I just  I can't get used to them
Same here
Why aren't you married, William
Oh, Trace, what the hell
I was close once
It just didn't happen
It surprises me
It really does
Well



Anyone who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me disagreeable
Just ask your husband
Very true
Very, very true
So how long have you lived here
Too long
How are you liking it
You know, takes time, settle in
It'll be good
WeIl, you get numb after awhile
There are things to any city
Subway
It will go away in a minute
It's nothing
Real estate guy
Fucking piece of



Sorry, honey
He's... 
He shows us the place a few times
I think he's good
He's efficient
Tracy really likes him
Then l start wondering why will he only bring us here five minutes at a time, yeah
We found out the first night
The soothing, relaxing, vibrating home, huh
I'm sorry
Yeah, all right, laugh it up
I don't know why you're laughing
All right, already
The guy would've had to get in...  
..before the office was closed and security tightened
Now, Gould would've been working late
I'm certain
He was the biggest defense lawyer in town
Infamous, really
Now listen, body was found on Tuesday morning
The office was closed on Monday, which means the guy could've gotten in Friday



..laid low till the cleaning crew left then had his way with Gould all day Saturday



..Sunday, maybe even Monday
Hey, look at this
Gould was bound, right arm almost free
He was handed a butcher's knife
Check out the scale
SOMERSET: A pound of flesh
Yeah
<i>Merchant of Venice.</i> Didn't see it
"This task done and he would go free.
I'm telling you that chair was soaked through with sweat
Of course
The killer would've wanted Gould to take his time
..  
..to sit and decide which cut to make first
Imagine it
There's a gun in your face
Which part of your body is expendable
What about the love handle
Cut along the side of his own stomach
All right, let's take a fresh look at these
Even though the corpse is there, look through it
Edit out the initial shock
Trick is to find one item, one detail and focus on it...  
..until it's an exhausted possibility
Just gonna get another beer
Beer
Uh, wine, pIease
He's preaching
He's punishing
The sins were used in medieval sermons
There were seven cardinal virtues and seven deadly sins



..used as teaching tools
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like in, uh, The Parson's Tale and  What's this
Uh, Dante
You read them
Yeah
Well, parts
Hey, remember in, uh, Purgatory
Dante and his buddy, they're climbing up the hill.. 

..they're checking out all the sinners, yeah
Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation
Yeah, yeah, right
But there, pride comes first, not gluttony
Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider that the books were the killer's inspiration
The sermons were about atonement for sin
These murders are like forced attrition
Forced what
Attrition
It's when you regret your sins, but not because you Iove God
Oh, like because someone's sticking a fucking gun in your face
Mmhm
No fingerprints
Nope
Totally unrelated victims
Yup
And no witnesses of any kind
Which l don't get
Because the fucker had to get back out
WeIl, in any major city, minding your own business is a science
The first thing they teach women in rape prevention is never cry for help
Always yell "Fire.
Nobody answers to "Help.
You holler "fire," they come running
That's fucked up
He must've left another puzzle piece
You know what
Thank you for talking this out, but I gotta sleep
WaIk the dogs
This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity
I'm still leaving at the end of the week
Oh, shit
No, wait, wait
Gould's wife
She was out of town at the time
So this means she saw something
What if it's a threat
WeIl, I put her in a safe house
She wasn't too happy about it
SOMERSET: What if it isn't something she has seen
But something she's supposed to see, but hasn't been given a chance
Yeah, okay
What
I don't know
But that's the one thing
MILLS: Sign us in
Gotta see Mrs. Gould
GOULD: treat me like a prisoner
Why do you have a phone if l can't make long distance phone calls
Mrs. Gould
GOULD: Don't treat people like this
Mrs. Gould, l am sorry
I truly am
I don't understand
Okay, l need you to Iook at each photo very carefully
Look and see if there's anything strange or out of place
Um, anything at all
I don't see anything
You're sure
Please, l just I can't do this right now
Okay
SOMERSET [WHlSPERS]: It's got to be now
There may be something we haven't seen
GOULD: Wait
What
Here
This painting, it's upside down
You sure your men didn't move this
No, no
Those shots were taken before forensics
Nothing
There's gotta be something
Moved the screws to rehang it
Yep
What the fuck is that
Switchblade
Goddamn it
There must be something
He didn't paint the fucking thing
No, he's fucking with us, that's what he's doing
See this
This is us
Yeah
Just wait a minute
Now Somerset's climbing on the furniture
Just wait a minute
You're kidding me
Call the Print Lab
Oh, man
Honestly, have you ever seen anything like this
No
MAN: I can tell you, guys, just by looking at the swirl pattern...  
..they're not the victim's fingerprints
I don't know, man
I say he's whacked enough
It doesn't fit
He doesn't wants us to help him stop
MILLS: Who knows
So many freaks out there doing their little evil deeds they don't wanna do
"The voices made me do it
My dog made me do it
Jodie Foster told me to do it.
You know, um, I've seen this baby take as long as three days to make a match...  
..so maybe you guys wanna cross your fingers somewhere else
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you
About catching this guy
Yeah
SOMERSET: Hmm
Wish I still thought the way you do
Why don't you tell me what the hell it is you think we're doing then
Picking up the pieces
We're collecting all the evidence, taking all the pictures and samples
Writing everything down
Noting the time things happened
That's all
That's all
Putting everything into neat little piles and filing it away
On the off chance it will ever be needed in the courtroom
Picking up diamonds on a deserted island
Saving them in case we get rescued
MILLS: Bullshit
Even the most promising clues usually only lead to others
So many corpses roll away unrevenged
Don't try to tell me you didn't get that rush tonight
I saw you
We're getting somewhere
Wake up, Glimmer Twins
You've got a winner
This guy goes by the name of Victor
His real name is Theodore Allen
His prints were found at the scene by Homicide
He's got a Iong history of serious mental illness
His parents gave him a very strict Southern Baptist upbringing
But somewhere along the line, they fell short
Now, Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery and assault
Spent time in prison here a whiIe back for the attempted rape of a minor
But his lawyer saw to it that didn't last long
His lawyer, by the way, is the recently deceased Eli Gould
Greed murder victim
OFFlCER: Yes, sir
We're gonna finish this thing up today, ladies and germs
Victor's been out of circulation a whiIe, but there's still a residence in his name
You're not buying all this, are you
Doesn't seem like our guy, does it
You tell me
Our killer seems to have more purpose
You ever take a bullet
Never in my 34 years, knock wood
I've only taken my gun out three times with the intention of using it
Never pulled the trigger
Not once
You
Yeah, but, no, l never took a bullet, but I pulled my gun once, shot it once
RealIy
It was my first one of these
We were a secondary unit
I was pretty shaky going in
I was a rookie then
Anyway, we bust open the door looking for this junkie and, uh...  
..the fucker just opened fire on us
One cop got hit in the arm
Christ, what was his name
Spun him like a top
You know, I mean, more like slow motion
I remember
..  
..riding in that ambuIance
Well, he died right there
Right there
Christ, what was his fucking name
OFFlCER 1 : All rise
OFFlCER 2: Let's do it
Let's do it
OFFlCER 1 : Go, go, go
Move
Okay
OFFlCER 3: Get up there
SWAT goes before dicks
Hey
They love this
Police
Clear
Clear
OFFlCER: Clear
Clear
OFFlCER 2: CIear
Morning, sweetheart
Get up now, motherfucker
Now
Get up, you sack of shit
Oh, fuck me
Dicks, you'll wanna come take a look at this
Dicks
Oof
Jesus
Victor
MILLS: What the hell
Yeah, it's just Victor
SOMERSET: Call an ambulance
OFFICER: What is this
CALIFORNIA: Hearse more like it
SOMERSET: Also Forensics
California, get your peopIe out
CALlFORNIA: Go on now
No one touches anything
It's some frigging wax sculpture or something
"Sloth.
MILLS: Oh, man
Goddamn
SOMERSET: Those pictures were dated three days ago
This must be the first one
Look
It's dated exactly one year ago today
I got a hair sample, l got a stool sample, I got piss, I got fingernails
He's laughing at us
You got what you deserved
CALIFORNIA: He's alive, he's alive
That cocksucker's alive
SOMERSET: Guns down
Still breathing
Guns down
Emergency on that ambulance
Coming through
He's playing games
No shit
Look, we have to divorce ourselves from emotion here
Oh
No matter how hard it is, we have to remain focused
Hey, man, l feed off my emotions
How's that
Are you listening to me
Yes, I can hear you
MAN: Excuse me
What are you doing
Closed crime scene, get out
I got a right to be here
UPI photographer
Get out
MAN: Hey, I got a fucking right to be here
MILLS: Get out of here
Get out
Jesus
Fucking jerk
Fuck you
I got your picture, man
Oh, yeah
MAN: I got your picture
MILLS: Yeah
Detective Mills, MlLLS, fuck off
MAN: I'm surprised you can spell
MILLS: Fuck you
How do they get here so fucking quick
They pay police for the information
And they pay well
Hey, man, l'm sorry, I 

..  Those, ugh.. 

You know, they piss me off
It's okay
It's impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions
BEARDSLEY: A year of immobility seems about right



..judging by the deterioration of the muscles and the spine
Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his system
Even an antibiotic.. 

..which must've been administered to keep the bed sores from infecting
Now, has he tried to speak or communicate in any way
Even if his brain were not mush, which it is



..he chewed off his own tongue long ago
SOMERSET: Uh, Doc
Is there absolutely no chance that he might survive
Detective, he'd die of shock right now if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes
He's experienced about as much pain and suffering as anyone l've encountered
Give or take
And he still has hell to look forward to
Good night
MAN [ON RADIO]: Tonight we bring you <i>the Charlie Parker Quintet.</i>  <i>Featuring Sir Charles Thompson on piano,</i> <i>Herb Pomeroy's trumpet...</i>  <i>...Jimmy Woode, bass, Kenny Clarke, drums,</i> <i>and the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker.</i>  Yeah
TRACY [OVER PHONE]: HeIlo, William
<i>It's Tracy.</i> Tracy
Is everything all right
<i>TRACY: Yeah, yes, everything's fine.</i>  Where's David
<i>TRACY: He's just, uh</i>  <i>He's in the other room.</i> <i>He's in the shower.</i>  <i>Um, l'm sorry to call you like this.</i>  Oh, it's all right
Um



What can I do for you, Tracy
I, uh....  Um, heh
I need someone to talk to
Do you think you could meet me somewhere...  
..maybe tomorrow morning
I don't understand
<i>I feel stupid calling, but, uh...</i>  
..you're the only person that I know here
There's no one else
<i>If you can, just, uh, give me a call, okay?</i>  <i>I have to go now.</i>  <i>Well, good night.</i> Good night
TRACY: I mean, you know this city so well
You've been here so long
SOMERSET: It can be a hard place
I don't know why I asked you to come
Why don't you talk to him about it
Tell him how you feel
I can't
You know, l can't be a burden
Especially now
I'll get used to things
You know
l think I just



I wanted to talk to someone who's lived here for a long time and...
I mean, upstate, you know, it's a completely different environment
Did David tell you that I teach fifth grade
Well, I did
Uh, he mentioned it
I've been going around, you know, looking at schools
But the conditions here are horrible
What about private schools
I don't know
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you, Tracy
David and I are gonna have a baby
Oh, Tracy, I 

.
I don't think I'm the, heh



I'm the one to talk to about this
I hate this city
I had a relationship once
It was very much Iike a marriage
We got pregnant
This was a long time ago
I remember getting up one morning and going to work
Just another day like any other, except it was the first day after l knew about



..the pregnancy
And l felt this fear for the first time ever
I remember thinking how can I bring a child into a world like this
How can
How can a person grow up with all this around them
I told her l didn't want to have it
And over the next few weeks
..  
.. l wore her down
I wanna have children
I can teIl you now that



I'm I know, l mean



I'm positive that I made the right decision
But there's not a day that passes



..that l don't wish that I had made a different choice
If you don't keep



The baby, I mean, if that's your decision



..don't ever tell him that you were pregnant
But if you choose to have this baby



..you spoil that kid every chance you get
That's about all the advice I can give you, Tracy
I got to go
William
Thank you
SOMERSET: Victor's landlord said there was an envelope of cash in the office mailbox
..  
..the first of every month
Quote:  "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in Apartment 306
And nobody ever complained about him
Heh
He's the best tenant I've ever had," end quote
Yeah, a landlord's dream
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue
Who pays the rent on time
I'm sick of all this waiting
This is the job
Why aren't we out there, huh
Why do we gotta sit here rotting, waiting till the lunatic does it again
It's dismissive to call him a lunatic
Don't make that mistake
Come on, he's insane
Look
Right now he's probably dancing around in his grandma's panties
Yeah, rubbing himself in peanut butter
Ooh
How's that
I don't think so
His luck will run out
Not depending on luck
We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he tied Victor to the bed
One year to the day
He wanted us to
Don't know that for sure
Oh, yes, we do
This note he left
His first words to us
Fuck him
So what
He's right, so far
Imagine the will it takes to keep a man bound for a full year
To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints
To insert tubes into his genitals
This guy is methodical, exacting, and worst of all, patient
He's a nut bag
And just because the fucker's got a library card doesn't make him Yoda
How much money you got
I got like 50
50 bucks
SOMERSET: I propose a field trip
Come on
We'll make a list
At the top we'll put Purgatory, <i>Canterbury Tales.</i>  Anything relating to the seven deadly sins
Ask yourself Hey, wait, wait
what would he study to do the things he's done
What are his interests now
Jack the Ripper, for instance
MILLS: Where are we going
SOMERSET: Library
MAN: Coupons, coupons, free coupons
Discount Discount coupons
They must've had about 50 health violations during the last inspection
Could you at least sit across from me
I don't want people thinking we're dating
Give me your money
I'm giving you this, but for some reason, I don't think I know what we're doing
Fuck
GREASY: Hey, Somerset, how you doing
Okay
Didn't figure this was a ménage à trois
It's not a problem
Sit down
Only for you do I do this, so it's a big risk
So I figure we're just fair and square
It's a deal
AIl right
About an hour
Yeah, help yourself
WeIl, that was money well spent
Yeah
All right
By telling you this, l'm trusting you more than l trust most people
WeIl, good, because l'm ready to punch you
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth
The guy in the pizza parlor is a friend from the Bureau
Who, stinky man
See, for years the FBI's been hooked into the library system, keeping records
Mmhm
Assessing fines
No, monitoring reading habits
Look
What
Certain books are flagged
Books on, say, nuclear weapons and, well, Mein Kampf
Anyone who checks out a flagged book
..  
..has his library records fed into the FBI's computers then on
Wait, wait, wait, how is this legal
Oh, legal, illegal
These terms don't apply
Oh
You  You can't use the information directly
It's just a useful guide
It might sound silly, but you can't get a library card
..  
..without, uh, an ID and a current phone biIl, see
So they run a list
Precisely
If you wanna know who's reading <i>Purgatory and Paradise Lost...</i>  <i>...and Helter Skelter,</i> the FBl's computers wiIl tell us
It could give us a name
It could
Could get a name of some college kid writing a term paper on 20thcentury crime
At least you're out of the office
Get a haircut
How do you know all this
I don't
Neither do you
Exactly
<i>"The Divine Comedy.</i> <i>History of Catholicism
"</i>  There's a book called <i>Murderers and Madmen.</i>  <i>"Modern Homicide Investigation,</i> <i>ln Cold Blood.</i>  <i>Of Human Bondage.
Bondage?</i>  Not what you think
Okay
<i>"The Marquis de Sade
"</i>  It's the Marquis de Sade
Whatever
<i>"The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqua"</i> Something
Saint Thomas Aquinas
There it is
He wrote about the seven deadly sins
Is that it
Yeah
Let's try it
Jonathan Doe
Whatever
SOMERSET: We're sure about that name
MILLS: Yeah
You saw it, John Doe
You wanna go back, l'll go back
Let's take a Iook at him
Talk to him
MILLS: This is crazy
Ah, we'll just talk to him
Uhhuh
"Excuse me, sir
Are you by any chance a serial kiIler?
Okay

The hell we can't
We need a warrant
We got probable cause
Come on

How did we get here
Huh
I can't tell anyone this, l can't tell anyone
Oh, come on, out of the way
We have no reason to be here
Will you listen to me
Get off
Listen to me, listen
Get the fuck off me
All right, all right, I'm sorry
But would you just pay attention a minute
If we leave a hole like this, we won't be able to prosecute
The fucking guy will walk
Now, is that what you want
By the time we clear a warrant, someone else   No, fuck that
We need a reason to knock on this door
No, no
Think about it
Okay
Okay, man
Okay
You're right
l'm all fucked up
When you're right, you're right
WeIl, no point in arguing anymore
Unless you can fix that
You stupid son of a....  How much money we got left
So, yeah, like, l noticed this guy going out a lot
When the murders was happening, so l, um...
So So you called Detective Somerset, right
Yeah, right, right, so l called the detective, because this guy was creepy and shit
And one of the murders, it happened right over there
Okay
I told you the rest
You got it
Called the cops
Good

SOMERSET: Everybody, stay outside
Victor

The fucking photographer in the fucking stairs
We had him and we let him go
You're sure this is him
Yup, good, good
Yup
Yeah, good, get it out
SARA: All right
Uh, we've got nothing, no pay stubs, no appointment books, no addresses
This is the best, this receipt
Keep looking
Let me show you something
This was under the bed
Uh, his only source of funds
No kidding, we got his money
Fucking A, l like it
SARA: One thing
MILLS: Yes
You're probably not gonna believe this
We haven't found a fingerprint yet
Um, not a single one
You're right, l don't
Keep looking
We could use some more men here
Hey, man, l'm doing the best I can
What are you getting with all this
There are 2000 notebooks on these shelves
And each notebook contains about 250 pages
Forget it
Anything about the killings
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are, and what a gross stage we dance on
What fun we have dancing and fucking
Not a care in the world
Not knowing that we are nothing
We are not what was intended.
No, wait, there's a lot more
"On the subway today, a man came up to me to start a conversation
He made small talk, a lonely man, talking about the weather and things
I tried to be pleasant and accommodating
But my head began to hurt from his banaIity
I almost didn't notice it had happened, but I suddenly threw up all over him
He was not pleased
And l couldn't stop laughing.
No dates
Placed on the shelves in no discernible order
Just his mind poured out on paper
Looks like a life's work
If we had 50 men reading in 24hour shifts, it'd still take two months
I know, l know, I know
MAN: Where's that phone
Phone

People, quiet
Hello

<i>I don't know how you found me,</i> <i>but imagine my surprise.</i>  <i>I respect you law enforcement agents</i> <i>more every day.</i>  Well, I appreciate that, John
I tell you <i>JOHN: No, listen, all right?</i>  <i>I'll be readjusting my schedule</i> <i>in light of today's little setback.</i>  <i>I just had to call</i> <i>and express my admiration.</i>  <i>Sorry l had to hurt one of you...</i>  <i>...but I didn't really have a choice, did I?</i> Hmm

All right, everybody, back to work
You were right
SOMERSET: Hmm
Ugh, he's preaching
Yeah
These murders are his sermons to us
Look, we know him, we know him, we know him
Who's the blonde
Looks like a pro
Maybe
She caught John Doe's eye
BILL: Yeah, he came and collected it last night
MILLS: Last night
BILL: Yeah
This man
Yeah, John Doe
It's an easy name to remember
He had a limp
What was this job you did for him
I've got a picture of it
Hang on
One sweet piece, actually
I thought he was one of them performance artists, that's what I thought
You know, the sort of guy that pisses in a cup on stage and, uh, then drinks it
Performance art
Hmm
I think l undercharged him, actually
You made this for him
Yeah, I've made weirder shit than that
So what
They found the blonde
The picture
Fucking pigs
OFFlCER: We need you to move, paI
MAN: l'll come out, but you guys  OFFlCER: Get the fuck out of the booth
I've been in this cage the whoIe time
Okay
I'm not fucking with you
Come on, this way
Can you do something about this music
Yeah, we're working on it
We're looking for the guy
You from Homicide
You  You better see this
Yeah
All right
OFFlCER: Hey, easy
Got him
MAN: Get this thing off of me
Oh, God, get this thing off of me
Get this thing off of me
Get this off
MILLS: Get him out of here, now
Get him out of here, now
MILLS: Come on, I wanna hear it again
Tell me again
MAN: Just I don't know
You heard nothing strange, you saw nothing strange
No
MILLS: No
He asked me if I was married
And l could see he had a gun in his hand
Where was the girl
The what
What
The girl, the prostitute
Where was she
Someone comes to your establishment
They want to go downstairs and wanna get a little ooh Ia Ia
Whatever
They got to come to you, yeah
Yeah
You didn't see anyone
With a package
A knapsack
Something under their arm
Hey, everybody that comes in there's got a package under their arms
Some guys are carrying suitcases full of stuff
She was just sitting on the bed
Who tied her down
You or him
Do you like what you do for a living
These things you see
No
No, I don't
But that's Iife, isn't it
He had a gun and he made it happen
He made me do it
He put that thing on me
And he made me wear it
Then he told me to fuck her
And l did
l fucked her
Oh, God
Oh, God
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth
The fucking gun was in my throat
<i>Fuck.</i>   <i>Oh, God, God.</i>  <i>God, help me
Please, please, help me.</i>  <i>Please, please, help me.</i>   You know, this isn't gonna have a happy ending
It's not possibIe
Hey, if we catch him, I'll be happy enough
If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil  I mean, if he's Satan himself, that might live up to our expectations...  
..but he's not the devil
He's just a man
You know



..see, you bitch and you compIain and you tell me these things
These:   If you think you're preparing me for hard times, thank you, but...
But you gotta be a hero
You wanna be a champion
Let me tell you, people don't want a champion
They wanna eat cheeseburgers, play lotto and watch TV
How did you get like this
I wanna know
Ah
It wasn't one thing, I can tell you that
Go on
I just don't think I can continue to live in a place that embraces and nurtures apathy



..as if it was a virtue
You're no different, no better
I didn't say l was different or better
I'm not
HelI, I sympathize
I sympathize completeIy
Apathy is a solution
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself in drugs than it is to cope with life
Yeah
It's easier to steal what you want...  

.than it is to earn it
Yeah
It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it
Hell, love costs
lt takes effort and work
We are talking about peopIe who are mentaIly ill.  We are talking about people, fucking crazies
No
No, we're not
Yes, today
We're talking about everyday life here
You can't afford to be this naive
Fuck off
See, you should listen to yourself
Yeah
You say that the problem with people is that they don't care
So l don't care about people
It makes no sense
You know why
Uh, you care
You wanna know
Damn right
And you're gonna make a difference
Whatever, the point is, is that l don't think you're quitting



..because you believe these things you say
I don't
I think you wanna believe them because you're quitting
You want me to agree and say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right
It's all fucked up
It's a fucking mess
We should alI go live in a fucking log cabin.
But l won't
I won't say that
I don't agree with you
I do not
I can't
I'm gonna go home
Thank you, though
I love you, honey
So much
TRACY: I know
MAN: 911 , what's your emergency
Could you repeat that
JOHN [OVER PHONE]: <i>I've gone and done it again.</i>  What have we got
Uh, sleeping pills
Glued to one hand
TeIephone glued to the other
You see what he did
He sliced her up
Then he bandaged her
CalI for help and you'll Iive
But you'll be disfigured
Or you can put yourself out of your own misery
Come on
Cut off her nose
To spite her face
And he did it very recently
SOMERSET: Listen
I've decided to stay on till this is done
I figure one of two things will happen
We'lI get John Doe or he'll finish his series of seven and this case will go on for years
MILLS: Hey man, you don't have to do me any favors
Thank you, but I got it
SOMERSET: I'm requesting that you keep me on as your partner for a few more days
You'd be doing me a favor
MILLS: You knew I'd say yes
Hey, we're here
SERGEANT: Wonderful
Your wife called
Get yourself an answering machine
JOHN: Detective
After this, l'm gone
No big surprise
JOHN: Detective
You're looking for me
Hey
Don't you fucking move
On the fucking floor
Keep away from him
MILLS: On the fucking floor
I know you
Now
Get down
Get down on your stomach, you piece of shit
Now
All the way
All the way, fucker
Down
Faster
Faster
Faster, fucker
Now
Nose on the ground
Jesus Christ
What the fuck is this
I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please
Goddamn it
CAPTAIN: He cuts the skin off the tips of his fingers
That's why we couldn't find one single usable print in his apartment
Looks like he's been doing it for a quite sometime
MILLS: What about the bank accounts
The guns
CAPTAIN: So far everything's a dead end
No credit history
No employment records
His bank account's only 5 years old and it was started with cash
We're even trying to trace his furniture
About only thing we know about that guy right now



..is that he's independently wealthy, welIeducated and totally insane
Because he's John Doe by choice
Okay, so when do we get to question him
CAPTAIN: You don't
He going to court now
MILLS: What
I'm telling you, there's no way he'd turn himself in
It doesn't make any sense
Well, there he sits
It's not supposed to make any sense
He's not finished
No, he's pissing in our faces
We're just taking it like idiots
You know what l'm talking about
For the first time ever, you and I are in total agreement
He wouldn't just stop
MILLS: Ugh, so, what the fuck, man
SOMERSET: He's two murders away from completing his masterpiece
We'll wait for his plea
My client says there are two more bodies
Two more victims hidden away
He will take Detectives Mills and Somerset to these bodies



..but only Detective Mills and Somerset, only at 6:00 today
Why us
He says he admires you
It's part of the game
The client claims if the detectives do not accept this...  

.these bodies will never be found
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot
Hey
We've got him
Downstairs, locked up
Done deal
He's gonna get his free room and board, get his free cable TV
Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable
Why are we having this conversation
Mills
No
Hey, something stinks
And this one here  Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit and that smug smile on your face...  

.dealing for that shit, l don't Iike it MilIs
I am required by law to serve my clients




.to the best of my ability
Aw, Jesus
To serve their best interest
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr
My client wishes inform you if you do not accept...  
..he will plead insanity across the board
TALBOT: Let him try it
I'd like to see him try
Come on, now, we alI know the extreme nature of these crimes...  
.. l could get him off with such a plea
I'm not letting this conviction slide
I can tell you that
He says that if you do accept under his specific conditions...  
..he'll sign a full confession, plead guilty right now
It's your case
Make a decision
Full confession
I'm in
It has to be the both of you
If he were to claim insanity, this conversation is admissible
The fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea
And my client would like to remind you two more are dead
Press would have a field day...  
..if they find out the police didn't seem concerned about them
Giving them a proper burial
If in fact there are two more dead
Lab report came up from downtown
They did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails
They found blood from Doe
From him slicing his fingers
Blood from the woman who's face he cut off
And blood from a third party, as yet unidentified
You'd be escorting an unarmed man
Let's finish it
SOMERSET: If John Doe's head splits open and a UFO should fly out
..  
.. l want you to have expected it
I will
Hey, man, if l was to accidentally shave off a nipple...  
..would it be covered by workman's comp
Hmm
I suppose so
Yeah
If you were man enough...  
..to actualIy file a claim, I'd buy you one out of my own pocket
If l keep coming home late, my wife's gonna think something's up
You know



Yeah
What
ON RADlO]   ON RADlO]  Let's go
PILOT [OVER RADIO]: <i>CVictor55 take
Clear the TC.</i>  Pull around
<i>There it is.</i> <i>Latemodel black sedan at your 10 o'clock.</i>  ON RADlO]  Who are you, John
Who are you really
What do you mean
At this stage, what harm can it do to telI us a bit about yourseif
It doesn't matter who l am
Who I am means absolutely nothing
You need to stay on your left up here
So where are we heading
You'll see
We're not just going to pick up two more dead bodies, are we, John
That wouldn't be shocking enough
We've got newspapers to think about, yeah
Wanting people to listen...  
..you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore
You have to hit them with a sledgehammer
And then you'll notice you've got their strict attention
MILLS: But the question is:  What makes you so special that people should listen
I'm not special
JOHN [ON RADlO]: <i>I've never been exceptional.</i>  <i>This is, though, what I'm doing.</i> <i>My work.</i>  Your work, John
Yes
See, I don't I don't see anything special about it, John
That's not true
No, it is true
And the funny thing is, all this work...  
..two months from now, no one's gonna care
No one's gonna give a shit, no one's gonna remember
You can't see the whole complete act yet
But when this is done...  
..when it's finished...  
..it's going to be



People will barely be able to comprehend
But they won't be able to deny
Could the freak be more vague
I mean, as far as master plans go, John  I can't wait for you to see
l really can't
It's really going to be something
WeIl, you know what
I'm gonna be standing next to you
So when this big thing happens, you be sure and let me know
Because I wouldn't wanna miss it
JOHN: Oh, don't worry
You won't
You won't miss a thing
<i>PILOT: With the tour bus itself,</i> <i>give two miles separation.</i>  What's so exciting
It's not too far now
PILOT: <i>Hightension lines ahead.</i>  <i>Prepare for frequency change.</i>  I've been trying to figure something in my head
And maybe you can help me out, yeah
When a person is insane, as you clearly are



..do you know that you're insane
Maybe you're sitting around, reading Guns and Ammo...  
..masturbating in your own feces, do you just stop and go:  "Wow, it is amazing how fucking crazy I really am"
Yeah
Do you guys do that
It's more comfortable for you to label me insane
It's very comfortable
It's not something l would expect you to accept
But l did not choose
l was chosen
MILLS: Well, whatever
I don't doubt that you believe that, John
But seems to me that you're overlooking a glaring contradiction
Meaning what
Glad you asked
If you were chosen...  
..that is, by a higher power...  
..and if your hand was forced...  
..it seems strange to me that you'd get such enjoyment out of it
You enjoyed torturing those people
This doesn't seem in keeping with martyrdom, does it
John
I doubt I enjoyed it any more than Detective MilIs



..would enjoy time alone with me in a room without windows
Isn't that true
How happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity
That hurts my feelings
I would never You wouldn't because there's consequences
It's in those eyes of yours, though
Nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work
I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner
Wait a minute, l thought all you did was kill innocent people
Innocent
ls that supposed to be funny
An obese man
A disgusting man who could barely stand up
If you saw him, you'd point him out to your friends so they'd join you in mocking him
A man, who if you saw him whiIe you were eating.. 

..you wouldn't be able to finish your meal
And after him, lawyer
You must've secretly been thanking me for that one
This is a man who dedicated his life...  
..to making money by lying with every breath that he could muster...  
..to keeping murderers and rapists on the streets
Murderers
A woman
Murderers, John, like yourself
A woman...  
..so ugly inside that she couIdn't bear to go on living
..  
..if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside
A drug dealer
A drug dealing pederast, actually
And let's not forget the diseasespreading whore
OnIy in a world this shitty



..could you try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face
But that's the point
We see a deadly sin on every street corner.. 

..in every home and we toIerate it
We tolerate it because it's common, it's
..
It's trivial
We tolerate it morning, noon and night
Well, not anymore
I'm setting the example
And what I've done is gonna be



..puzzled over.. 

..and studied



..and followed



..forever
Yeah
Delusions of grandeur
You should be thanking me
Why's that, John
Because you're going to be remembered after this
Realize, detective, the only reason that I'm here right now...  
..is that I wanted to be
No
No, we would've got you eventuaIly
Oh, really
So, what were you doing, biding your time
Toying with me
Allowing five innocent people to die until you felt like springing your trap
Tell me, what was the indisputable evidence you were going to use on me.. 

..right before I walked up to you and put my hands in the air
John, calm down
I seem to remember us knocking on your door
Oh, that's right
And l seem to remember breaking your face
You're only alive because I didn't kill you
Okay, sit back
I spared you
Sit back
Remember that every time you look in the mirror
..  
..at that face of yours for the rest of your life...  
..or should l say for the rest...  

.of what life I allow you to have
MILLS: Sit back
Sit back, you fucking freak
Shut your fucking mouth
You're no messiah
You're a movie of the week
You're a fucking Tshirt at best
Don't ask me to pity those peopIe
I don't mourn them any more



..than the thousands that died at Sodom and Gomorrah
Is that to say, John, that what you were doing was God's good work
The Lord works in mysterious ways
Do you see those hightension towers
JOHN: That's where we're headed
PILOT: I see where
<i>Right to your 9 o'clock</i> <i>and follow that access road.</i>  MAN: <i>Your signal's breaking up, Viking.</i>  <i>PILOT: Unfuckingavoidable, Center.</i> <i>We're in powerline city, deal with it.</i>  This sure as shit is no ambush out here
No fucking nothing out here
Can't Iand anywhere near
They're gonna be coming up behind us in about two minutes
I want you to go up, way up
Thirty seconds, bank east on my mark
Thirty seconds
I'm getting him out
PILOT: <i>Target is now fully into standby.</i>  <i>Got you in sight.</i>  MILLS [ON RADIO]: <i>Get out.</i>  Slowly
Stop
Stay
What do you got
Dead dog
I didn't do that
PILOT: <i>We're holding on standby, copy?</i>  What time is it
Why
I'd like to know
Sevenohone
It's close
Let's go take a look
It's this way
PILOT 1 : <i>Bird 2, close your distance.</i>  PILOT 2: <i>This is Bird 2
They're away from the car.</i>  <i>Coming in closer.</i>  <i>We got them
We got them
Closing in.</i>  PILOT 1 : <i>Negative
Negative
Hold your go.</i>   Mills
Down, down, down
Watch him
There he goes
JOHN: <i>It's good we have some time to talk.</i>  PILOT: <i>Van approaching.</i>  Stay on the guy in red
Do not take the crosshairs off the guy in red
<i>PILOT: He's going out</i> <i>to meet the van
Just stay down.</i>  There's a van coming down the road
From the north
Be ready for anything, now
Wait for my signal
Wait for me
Get out of the van
SOMERSET [ON RADlO]: <i>Out!</i>  MAN: Jesus Christ, man
Don't shoot me
Step away
Turn around
Put your hands on your head
CALIFORNIA: What the hell is going on
SOMERSET: What are you doing here
I'm delivering a package
I got this package for this guy, David
Uh, Detective David Mills
Get it
Slowly
PILOT: <i>Stay alert
He's opening the back of the van.</i>  <i>We've got him in sight.</i>  This guy paid me 500 bucks to bring it out here, man
He said he wanted it here at exactly 7:00
Put it down
SOMERSET: <i>We got a box.</i>  We got a box
CalI the bomb squad
I need a bomb squad
We got a box
SOMERSET: Face the van
Hands up
Turn around
Okay
Go
Off you go
Go
PILOT: <i>Do you want us to pick this guy up?</i>  I'm sending the driver out on foot
<i>PILOT: Got the driver in sight.</i> He's headed north
Have him picked up
Oh, l don't know
I'm gonna open it
JOHN: When l said I admired you, I meant what I said
SOMERSET: It's blood
JOHN: You've made quite a life for yourself
MILLS: Hmm
JOHN: You should be very proud
Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit
PILOT: <i>Someone lost contact, copy.</i>  California, stay away from here
Stay away from here, now
Don't come in here
<i>Whatever you hear, stay away.</i>  John Doe has the upper hand
Mills
Here he comes
SOMERSET: Throw your gun down
What
I wish l could've lived like you
Shut up
What the fuck you talking about
SOMERSET: Go away
Do you hear me, detective
I'm trying to tell you how much I admire you and your pretty wife
What
Tracy
SOMERSET: Mills
What'd you fucking say
It's disturbing how easily a member of the press can purchase information



..from the men in your precinct
CALIFORNIA: What the fuck
SOMERSET: <i>Throw your gun down!</i>  JOHN: I visited your home this morning
...  After you'd left
SOMERSET: Mills
I tried to play husband
I tried to taste the life of a simple man
SOMERSET: Throw it away
Tsk, it didn't work out
So...
I took a souvenir
Her pretty head
SOMERSET: Mills
Mills
What's he talking about
Give me your gun
What's going on over there
Put the, ugh Put the gun down
I saw you with a box
What was in the box
Because I envy your normal life
Put the gun down, David
It seems that envy is my sin
Oh, what's in the box
Not until you give me the gun
What's in the box
SOMERSET: Give me the gun
He just told you
You Iie
You're a fucking liar, shut up
SOMERSET: David
That's what he wants
He wants you to shoot him
No
No
You tell me that's not true
That's not true
Become vengeance, David
Oh, she's all right
You tell me
Become...  

.wrath
Tell me she's all right
If you murder a suspect, David No
SOMERSET: You throw it all away, he knows it
No
She begged for her life
SOMERSET: Shut up
She begged for her life and for the life of the baby inside of her
Oh
He didn't know
Give me the gun, David
David
If you kill him...  
..he will win
Oh, God
Oh
CALlFORNIA: Oh, fuck, he shot him
<i>Set it down somewhere.</i>  <i>Come on, set us down.</i>  <i>Holy Christ
Somebody call somebody.</i>  <i>Call somebody.</i>   WeIl, we'll take care of him
Whatever he needs
Where are you gonna be
Around
I'll be around

What are you looking at, Caroline
The wind, mom
They say the hurricane is coming
I'm on a boat
I'm drifting
Can I do anything for you, mom
Make anything easier
Oh, sugar..
There's nothing left to do
Is what it is
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open
My mouth's full of cotton
There, there, miss Daisy
You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons
Do you want any more medication, mother
Doctor said you could have as much as you want
No need for anybody to suffer
A friend told me that she never had the chance  to say goodbye to her mother
I wanted to


It’s okay
I wanted to tell you how much I’m gonna miss you so..
Mom
Oh, Caroline
Are you afraid
I'm curious
What comes next
They built the train station in 1918
My father was there the day it opened
He said they had  a tuba band playing
They had the finest clockmaker in all of the South  to build that glorious clock
His name was...  Mr. Gateau
Mr. Cake
He was married to a Creole of Evangeline Parish  and they had a son
Mr. Gateau was, from birth, absolutely blind
When their son was old enough, he joined the army
And they prayed God would keep him out of harm's way
For months, he did nothing but work on that clock
One day,  a letter came
And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,  went up, alone, to bed
And their son came home
They buried him in the family plot,  where he would be with them when their time came
Mr. Cake worked on his clock,  laboring to finish
It was a morning to remember
Papa said there were people everywhere
Even Teddy Roosevelt came
It’s running backwards
I made it that way  so that perhaps the boys that we lost in the war  might stand and come home again
Home to farm,  work,  have children
To live long, full lives
Perhaps my own son might come home again
I’m sorry if I’ve offended anybody
I hope you enjoy my clock
Mr. Cake was never seen again
Some say he died of a broken heart
Some say he went to sea
Excuse me
Do you mind if I make a call
Somebody's watching my little boy
Sure
I hope I haven't disappointed you
You couldn't disappoint me
Well, I know I don't have much to show for myself
Find my dark suitcase
There's a diary
This
Could you read it to me
Is this what you want to do
I tried to read it a hundred different times
Mom, it's not exactly


It’s just the sound of your voice, darling
Okay
It’s dated April 4th, 1 985
And it says New Orleans
"This is my last will and testament
"I don't have much to leave, few possessions, no money, really
"I will go out of this world the same way I came in, alone and with nothing
"All I have is my story,  "and I’m writing it now while I still remember it
"My name is Benjamin
Benjamin Button.
And I was born under unusual circumstances
The First World War had ended,  and I’ve been told it was an especially good night to be born
Thank God it's over
We won the war
The Great War is over
What are you doing here
Thomas,  I’m afraid she's going to die
What
That's enough
All of you, get away from her
I came as quickly as I could
The streets are filled with people
Thomas
Promise me he has a place
Yeah
She gave her life for me
And for that, I am forever grateful
Mr. Button
Thomas
Thomas
Thomas
Where are you going
Hey
What are you doing there
What do you have there
Come on, Queenie
Now, Mr. Weathers
Come on, now, you know I ain't got nothing but work to do around here
Come on
Just take some time
Stop all this foolishness
The air is sweet
You look very handsome tonight, Miss Queenie
Handsome as I’ve ever seen
The brown matches your eyes
Oh, hush
Let's see here
You ain't no slouch yourself
Hambert's back in town
He came home legless, but he's home
I know you were sweet on him one time
Sweeter than I should've been
Miss Simone messed herself
Oh, sweet Jesus
She got to stop doing that or it's diapers for her
I’ll be right there, Miss Jameson
Now, Queenie, now come on
Okay, Queenie'll be right there
It’s awful nice out here
Come on out back for a moment
Take your mind off things
You're so bad
What in God's name
What's this
Oh, the Lord done something here
Hope I didn't hurt it none stepping on it like that
We best leave that for the police
Poor baby
I’ll go
It’s for sure nobody wanted to keep it
Come on, baby
Queenie
Where are you, Queenie
Hold your water
You go deal with it
Okay
No, go, I’ll be back
Queenie, Apple, she went and messed herself all over again
Jane Childress, start her a bath
And mind your own business, Mrs. Duprey
You’ll be messing yourself soon enough
Somebody stole my necklace
Okay
All right, Mrs. Hollister, I’ll be right with you, okay
Go on back upstairs, hear
You are as ugly as an old pot  but you're still a child of God
Queenie, Apple, she won't take a bath without you
Mercy
I’ll be right there
Okay
You just wait right here for me now, okay
My sister gave me those pearls
I can't find them anywhere
Somebody's been stealing my jewelry
They're right here, Mrs. Hollister
See
Right around your pretty white neck
Now, come on
Hush all that noise
Is Dr. Rose still here
I don't know
Your heart is strong
You just want to avoid any undue stimulation
I trust you ladies will help me out with that
I have something
Could you come downstairs
Never seen anything like it
Nearly blind from cataracts
I’m not sure if he can hear
His bones indicate severe arthritis
His skin has lost all elasticity, and his hands and feet are ossified
He shows all the deterioration, the infirmities, not of a newborn,  but of a man well in his 80s on his way to the grave
He's dying
His body is failing him before his life's begun
Where'd he come from
My sister's child
From Lafayette
She had an unfortunate adventure
The poor child, he got the worst of it
Come out white
There are places for unwanted babies like these, Queenie
No room for another mouth to feed here
The Nolan Foundation, despite their good intentions,  thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is
A baby


You said he don't have long
Queenie, some creatures aren't meant to survive
No, this baby, he is a miracle
That's for certain
Just not the kind of miracle one hopes to see
Y’all listen
Y’all listen up here
We're gonna have us a visitor  that's gonna be staying with us for a little while
My sister had a child and she couldn't see right by it, so


He's known as


Benjamin
He's not a well child, so we're gonna have to take good care of him
I had 1 0 children
There's not a baby I can't care for
Let me see him
God in Heaven
He looks just like my exhusband
Look, he's prematurely old
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much more time on this earth
Join the club
He's smiling
Hambert sends his remembrances to you
Are you right out of your mind
I know you ain't got all the parts it takes to make one of your own,  but this ain't yours to keep
It may not even be humankind
Mr. Weathers, come back here
Please
You never know what's coming for you
It seemed I had found a home
Is any of this true
You have such a lovely voice
Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token
That clock just kept going,  year after year after year
But I didn't know I was a child
Same old crap every day
I thought I was like everyone else there
An old man in the twilight of his life
Could you make him stop that
Stop banging that fork
It’s used for eating, not for playing with
And use your napkin, please, Mr. Benjamin
Queenie
Hey, boy
Always had a healthy curiosity
What was up the street
Or around the next corner
Go get him
Benjamin
That is dangerous
Come back over here
Stay put, child
I loved her very much
She was my mother
Mama
Some days I feel different than the day before
Everybody feels different about themselves, one way or another
But we're all going the same way
Just taking different roads to get there, that's all
You're on your own road, Benjamin
Mama
How much longer I got
Just be thankful for what you're given, hear
You're already here longer than you're supposed to
Some nights, I’d have to sleep alone
I didn't mind
I would listen to the house breathing
All those people sleeping
I felt safe
It was a place of great routine
Every morning at 5:30, no matter the weather,  General Winslow, U. S. Army, Retired, would raise the flag
Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once an opera singer of some note,  well, she sang Wagner
All right, baby, come on
We got to put some life into these old sticks for you
Get you walking so you can help me out around here
Come on now, hear
No matter the season, supper was served promptly at 5:30
Molasses
I learned to read when I was five
My grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor
He brung home every play for me to read
"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,  "Let dying Mortimer here rest himself
"Even like a man new haled from the rack,  "So fare my limbs with long imprisonment
"And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death,  "Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
You thought I was plain ignorant, didn't you
The actor my grandfather worked for was John Wilkes Booth
He killed Abraham Lincoln
You never know what's coming for you
On Saturday nights, Mama would make me go to church
Benjamin
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
What can I do for you, sister
Her parts are all twisted up inside and she can't have little children
Lord, if you could see clear to forgive this woman her sins  so she can bear the fruit of the womb
Out, damnable affliction
Praise God
Praise God
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
And what's this old man's irrediction
He's got the Devil on his back,  trying to ride him into the grave before his time
Out, Zebuchar
Yes
Out, Beelzebub
Yes
How old are you
Seven
But I look a lot older
God bless you
He's seven
Now, this is a man with optimism in his heart
All right
Belief in his soul
Yes
Yes
We are all children in the eyes of God
Yes
Hallelujah
We are gonna get you out of that chair
And we're gonna have you walk
Amen
It’s all right
In the name of God's glory


Rise up
Come on
Come on
Walk
Come on, son
Come on
Come on with it, son
Come on
Come on
Now God is gonna see you the rest of the way
He's gonna see this little old man walk without the use of a crutch or a cane
He's gonna see that you walk from faith


Hallelujah


.and divine inspiration alone
Yes
Hey, Ben
Go, son
Now walk
Yes
Come on
Don't touch him
Rise up, old man
Rise up like Lazarus
I said, rise up
Hallelujah
Yes
Come on
Say hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Walk
Walk on
Yes
That's right, Benjamin
Now when I look back on it, it was miraculous
But you know the saying, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away
Glory in the highest
Sweet Jesus
No
No
There were so many birthdays
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow..
So we wouldn't run out, we would spare the candles
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays and I don't like cake
And death was a common visitor
People came and went
You always knew when someone left us
There was a silence in the house
It was a wonderful place to grow up
I was with people who had shed ail the inconsequences of earlier life
Left wondering about the weather, the temperature of a bath,  the light at the end of a day
For everyone that died, someone would come to take their place
I’ve been married five times
My fifth wife and I are captured by a neighbor tribe of cannibals
Oh, goodness gracious
We escaped across the river
My wife, she can't swim, so, sadly, she eaten
Oh, my God
My second wife steps on cobra and dies
It was very bad luck to be married to me
That's Mr. Oti
He's an acquaintance of an acquaintance of mine
The next summer I’m captured


He's a Pygmy


.with three others by the Baschiele tribe
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer to a very strange American man
I hear you're not so old as you're looking
You just fooling everybody
What's the matter
Did you get Madjembe
What's Madjembe
Worms
I don't think I have worms
This is just how I am
Did you take your pills today
No, ma'am
Come
Let's get a cold root beer
I found the medication under your pillow
I’m not supposed to
It’s dangerous
Who said that
Come on, little man
Hello, children
Hold, please
Then I’m in the monkey house at Philadelphia Zoological Park
Three thousand people show up my first day
Look
What's it like living in a cage
It stinks
But the monkeys
They do some tricks there
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali
She is orangutan
When I’m not playing with the monkeys, they want me to run to the bars  in my cage, with my teeth
So then what'd you do
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there
Wandered most of the time
You were all alone
Plenty of time you’ll be alone
When you're different like us, it's gonna be that way
But I’ll tell you a little secret
Fat people, skinny people, tall people,  white people, they're just as alone as we are
But they're scared shitless
I think about the river I grew up on
It would be nice to sit by my river again
Come, I have an appointment
There's my little man
You ready, sugar
Always ready
Always ready
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin
It’s a pleasure to meet you, sir
My pleasure, ma'am
You can find your own way home, can't you
Take the St. Charles line to Napoleon
Hey
Hey
Where in God's name have you been
Get in here
I mean, you take my breath away, you know that
Oh, Lord, I was so worried about you
It had been the best day of my life
How's her breathing
It’s shallow
They say it’ll reach us in a few hours,  so I gotta get my baby and take him to my sister's
They say there's nothing to worry about here in the hospital
Nurses'll be right here if you need them
Are you okay
Yeah, I’m okay reading
I shouldn't be more than an hour
Was there just company
It was just Dorothy leaving
Go on, Caroline
"On Sundays, the families would come and visit.
It was Thanksgiving, 1 930
I met the person who changed my life forever
Well, Benjamin
Might I say you are looking strikingly youthful
Good day, Mrs. Fuller
A single cane, back straight as an arrow
What elixir have you been drinking
Thank you, ma'am
Grandma
Look at me
That was really something
Come on over here, you
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy
This is Mr. 

I’m afraid, Benjamin, I don't rightly know your last name
Benjamin's fine
I never forgot her blue eyes
Good people, supper is served
Health and food, for love and friends
For everything thy goodness sends
Amen
Amen
Amen
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds
Why do you say that
They're in the pheasant family, can't hardly fly
It’s sad, don't you think
Birds that can't fly
I love birds that can't fly
They are so delicious
That's terrible
I have something to telic y'all  while we're giving thanks for God's blessings
I had a miracle happen
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers
What does she mean, answered her prayers
Thanks
Thank you
She's gonna have a baby, silly
That's what my mama said when I was gonna have a baby brother,  but he didn't live long,  'cause he didn't breathe right
"In the afternoon, when he had got his beautiful hind legs  "just as Big God Nqong had promised
"You can see that it is 5:00,  "because Big God Nqong's clock says so.
Isn't that something
Again, read it again
Oh, read it again, please
All right
But afterwards, you must go to bed
I promise
"Old Man Kangaroo.
Are you sleeping
Who's that
It’s me, Daisy
Oh, hi
'Kay, come on
Where are we going
Come on
Under here
Here, you light it
I’m not supposed to play with matches
Don't be a chicken
Light it
I’ll telic you a secret if you’ll telic me one
Okay
I saw my mama kissing another man
Her face was red from it
Your turn
I’m not as old as I look
I thought so
You don't seem like an old person
Like my grandma
I’m not
Are you sick
Well, I heard Mama and Tizzy whispering
They said I was gonna die soon, but maybe not
You're odd
You're different than anybody I’ve ever met
May l
Okay
What are you doing under there
You come right out here and get back up to bed
It’s after midnight
You are not to be playing together
Yes, ma'am
Now you get back to bed, little lady
You're too young to be wandering around in the night on your own
And you ought to be ashamed of yourself
You are a different child
A manchild
And, baby, people aren't gonna understand just how different you are
What's wrong with me, Mama
Come here
God hasn't said yet, baby
Now go on to bed, hear
And behave yourself
Go on
Say your prayers, hear
Did I ever telic you I’ve been struck by lightning seven times
Once when I was repairing a leak on the roof
Once I was just crossing the road to get the mail
I never forgot her...  "


blue eyes.
Mom
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you from the first time that he saw you
Not many people experience that
Want me to go on
He crosses something out
When that baby came, things were different
Your mama gone away And your daddy gonna stay  Didn't leave nobody but the baby  Babies were born, people died
A lot of folks been through that old house
I’ve come to say goodbye
I’m going away
Going
Where
I haven't figured that out yet,  but I’ll send you a postcard when I get there
What about your friend, the tall lady
We are not friends anymore
That's what happens with tall people sometimes
Well, goodbye
Spent a lot of time by myself that year
Hello
Hi
I’m moving in today
Welcome
We've been expecting you
Can you please show her up to Mrs. Rousseau's old room
I’m sorry, but we usually don't allow dogs in the house
Well, she's old as the hills
She's almost blind
She won't be a bother much longer
Well, all right, long as she stays from up underfoot
Right this way, ma'am
As hard as I try, I can't remember her name
Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford
Maybe it was Maple
It’s funny how sometimes the people we remember the least  make the greatest impression on us
I do remember she wore diamonds
And she always dressed in fine clothing, as if she was going out
Although she never did and nobody ever came to visit her
She taught me to play the piano
It’s not about how well you play
It’s how you feel about what you're playing
Try this
You can't help putting yourself in the music
There were many changes
Some you could see, some you couldn't
Hair had started growing in all sorts of places,  along with other things
I felt pretty good, considering
Darling, the pain
All right, Mom, I’ll get the nurse
Look at this eye
This is a major hurricane,  a slow hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of...  Not doing too good
Nobody seems to know whether to stay or leave
I’m gonna ride it out
There
That should make things much easier
Have you had a chance to say your goodbyes
My father waited four hours for my brother to get here from Boger City
Couldn't go without him
She seems like a sweet woman
Yeah
I haven't had as much time with her as I would've


You busy
I could use your help
Excuse me
Sure
"Queenie would let me go with Mr. Daws

.
...to Poverty Point to watch the boats go up and down the river
These were hard times
Did I ever telic you I was struck by lightning seven times
Once when I was in the field, just tending to my cows
My fourth hand didn't show up
Anybody want to make $2 for a day's work 'round here
What's the matter
Nobody wants to do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay
He never pays
Nobody wants a job
I do
You got your sea legs about you, old man
I think
Well, that's good enough for me
Get your ass on board
We’ll sure as hell find out
I was as happy as I could be
I need a volunteer
I would do anything
Yes, Captain
Scrape off all this bird shit
Right away, sir
And I was actually gonna be paid for something I would've done for free
His name was Captain Mike Clark
He'd been on a tugboat since he was seven
Get moving, then
Come here
Can you still get it up
I do every morning
The old pole, huh
The high, hard one
I guess
When was the last time you had a woman
Never
Never
Not that I know of, sir
Wait a minute, now
You mean to say you've been on this earth however many years  and you've never had a woman
Damn, that's the saddest thing I’ve ever heard in my life
Never
No
Well, then, by Jesus, you are coming with me
What did your father do
I never met my father
You lucky bastard
All fathers want to do is hold you down
Out on my father's boat, workin' the twoaday,  this little, fat bastard
"Tug Irish," they called him
Anyway, I finally work up the nerve and telic him,  "I don't want to spend the rest of my life on a goddamn tugboat.
You know what I’m saying
You don't want to spend the rest of your life on a tugboat
Absolutely
Damn right
So you know what my father says to me
He says, "Who the hell do you think you are
"What the hell do you think you can do?
So I telic him
"Well, if you're asking,  "I want to be an artist.
He laughs
"An artist
God meant for you to work a tugboat, just like me
"And that's exactly what you're gonna do.
Well, I turned myself into an artist
A tattoo artist
I put on every one of these myself
You have to skin me alive to take my art away from me now
When I’m dead, I’m gonna send him my arm
That one
Don't let anyone telic you different
You gotta do what you're meant to do
And I happen to be a goddamned artist
But you're a tugboat captain
Captain Mike
We're ready for you and your friend
Let's go, old timer, eh
Break your cherry
Hello, my lovelies
Hey, Captain
Hi, Captain
Hi
Hi
Hi
He gives me the willies
That is not for me
How are you tonight, grandpa
It was a night to remember
What are you, Dick Tracy or something
I’ve got to rest
Again
Thank you
No, thank you
You have a nice night
Will you be here tomorrow
Every night but Sunday
It sure made me understand the value of earning a living
Good night, sweetie
Come back now
Things money can buy you
It’s nasty out
Can I offer you a ride somewhere
Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button
I’m Benjamin
Benjamin
It’s a pleasure to know you
Would you like to stop somewhere and have a drink
All right
Evening, Mr. Button
What’ll it be, sir
I’ll have whatever he's having
Sazerac for the both of us
With whiskey, not brandy
You don't drink, do you
It’s a night for firsts
How's that
I’ve never been to a brothel, either
Well, it's an experience
It certainly is
There's a time for everything
True enough
Your drinks
I don't mean to be rude, but your hands
Is that painful
Well, I was born with some form of disease
What kind of disease
I was born old
I’m sorry
No need to be
There's nothing wrong with old age
My wife passed away many years ago
I’m so, so sorry
She died in childbirth
To children
To mothers
What line of work you in, Mr. Button
Buttons
Button's Buttons
There isn't a button that we don't make
Our biggest competition is B. F. Goodrich  and his infernal zippers
Would you gentlemen like anything else
One for the road, Benjamin
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button
So, what line of work do you do
I’m a tugboat man
I enjoyed talking to you
I enjoyed drinking with you
Benjamin
Would you mind if, time to time, I stopped by and said hello
Anytime
Good night, Mr. Button
Good night, Benjamin
Drive on
Where have you been
Nothing
I met some people and listened to some music
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy
Growing up's a funny thing
Sneaks up on you
One person is there, then suddenly somebody else has taken her place
She wasn't all elbows and knees anymore
Benjamin
Come on
Okay
I loved those weekends when she'd come  and spend the night with her grandmother
Daisy
Daisy
You want to see something
You gotta keep it a secret, so get dressed
I’ll meet you out back
Come on
Can you swim
I can do anything you can do
Here, put this on
We gotta hurry
Is he okay
Captain
Captain Mike
Morning, Captain
Can you take us out
Do you know what day it is
Sunday
Do you know what that means
Means I was very drunk last night
Well, you're drunk every night
Is that a girl
Close friend
I want to show her the river
You're not supposed to go joyriding with civilians
I could lose my license
What are you waiting for
Pulled in for repair a wounded duck
She's flying now, huh
Ahoy, sailor
I wish we could go with them
Did you say something, Mom
It’s getting really bad
Can you hear me, Mom
Time just seeped out of me
"Things were changing quickly.
I don't know how it's possible, but you seem to have more hair
What if I told you that I wasn't getting older,  but I was getting younger than everybody else
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,  to have to see everybody you love die before you do
It’s an awful responsibility
I’d never thought about life or death that way before
Benjamin, we're meant to lose the people we love
How else would we know how important they are to us
And one fall day, a familiar visitor came knocking on our door
You want to go with me to the drugstore
She taught me how to play the piano
Amen
Amen
And she taught me what it meant to miss somebody
Let's go
I had gone to a brothel
I’d had my first drink
Said goodbye to one friend and buried another
In 1 936, when I was coming to the end of the 1 7th year of my life,  I packed my bag, said goodbye
Bye, Benjamin
Goodbye
I knew, life being what it was, I’d probably never see them again
Bye, Mr. Benjamin
Good luck to you, son
Thank you
I love you, Mama
I love you, too, baby
I want you to say your prayers every night, hear
Be safe, hear
Benjamin
Where you going
To sea
I’ll send you a postcard
From everywhere
Write me a postcard from everywhere
Can you imagine
He sent me a postcard from everywhere he went
Every place he worked
Newfoundland
Baffin Bay
Glasgow
Liverpool
Narvik
He had gone with that Captain Mike
Captain Mike had contracted for three years  with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage
The old ship had been refitted with a diesel engine and a new sea winch
We went around Florida and up the Atlantic seaboard
We were a crew of seven now
Captain Mike and me
Cookie, Prentiss Mayes from Wilmington, Delaware
The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,  who got along fine at sea but, for some reason,  once they were on dry land couldn't stand the sight of each other
You know, one in every eight boats never returns
There was John Grimm, who sure fit his name
All hands lost at sea
From Belvedere, South Dakota
And Pleasant Curtis from Asheville, Notch
Never said a word to anyone, except himself
I wrote him constantly
I told him I had been invited to audition in New York City  for the School of American Ballet
Please stay
Thank you
Thank you
You can stay
But I was relegated to the corps
Another dancing gypsy
Benjamin
How is it when you showed up  you were no bigger than a bollard with one foot in the grave,  but now, either I drink a hell of a lot more than I think I do,  or you sprouted
What's your secret
Well, Captain,  you do drink a lot
We stayed in a small hotel with a grand name, The Winter Palace
You have no idea what you're talking about
The hummingbird is not just another bird
Its heart rate's 1 ,200 beats per minute
Its wings beat 80 times a second
lf you was to stop their wings from beating,  it would be dead in less than 1 0 seconds
This is no ordinary bird
This is a frickin' miracle
They slowed down their wings with moving pictures,  and you know what they saw
Their wingtips are doing that
You know what the figure eight is the mathematical symbol for
Infinity
Infinity
Everybody, no matter what differences they had,  the languages, the color of their skin, had one thing in common
They were drunk every single night
Three, please
Could you hold, dear, for us, please
Thank you very much
Good evening
Her name was Elizabeth Abbott
She was not beautiful
She was plain as paper
But she was pretty as any picture to me
What are you looking at
lf you must know, we have a longstanding agreement  never to go to bed sober
Isn't that right, darling
Whatever you say, darling
Her husband was Walter Abbott
He was Chief Minister of the British Trade Mission in Murmansk,  and he was a spy
Darling
Oh, thank you, my darling
Key, darling
Oh, yes
I broke my heel off one of my shoes
I’m not in the habit of walking about in my stocking feet
They were long days there
And even longer nights
One particular night, I was having trouble sleeping
I’m sorry
I couldn't sleep
I was gonna make some tea
Would you like some
Oh, no
Thank you
Milk
Honey
A bit of honey, please
I hope you like flies in your honey
Oh, perhaps not
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little
Steep
Soak
I don't know, I mean, there's a proper way of making tea
Well, where I’m from, people just want it to be hot
Well, quite right
Now, you're a seaman
A sailor
I hope you won't think me impolite, but I have to ask,  aren't you a little old to be working on a boat
There's no age limit, as long as you can do the work
And you have trouble sleeping
Thank you
I didn't think I did
I usually sleep like a baby
Something's been keeping me up
My father, in his 80s,  he was so convinced he was gonna die in his sleep,  he limited himself to having afternoon naps
He was so determined he was gonna cheat death
Did he
Did he what
Die in his sleep
He died sitting in his favorite chair  listening to his favorite program on the wireless
He must have known something
My husband's the British Trade Minister, and we've been here for 1 4 months
Good God
We were supposed to go to Peking  but it never seemed to work out
Have you been in the Far East
No
I’ve never been anywhere, really
I mean, outside of harbors
And where is it that you're from
New Orleans
Louisiana
I didn't know there was another
And she told me about all the places she had been, and what she had seen
And we talked till just before the dawn
I’m just a lush, myself
And we went back to our rooms, to our separate lives
But every night, we'd meet again in that lobby
A hotel in the middle of the night can be a magical place
A mouse running, and stopping
A radiator hissing
A curtain blowing
There's something peaceful, even comforting  knowing that the people you love are asleep in their beds  where nothing can harm them
Elizabeth and I would lose track of the night  until just before daybreak
I think I may have given you the wrong impression
Beg pardon
Well, married women don't customarily sit around  in the middle of the night with strange men in hotels
I wouldn't know what a married woman does or doesn't do
Good night
Murmansk
"I’ve met somebody, and I’ve fallen in love.
Mom
That was over 60 years ago
Did you love him, Mother
What does a girl know about love
Well


I’m not dressed
Oh, you look splendid, just as you are
Don't waste any time bothering about the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,  'cause they're really completely ordinary,  but the caviar and the vodka  are sublime and plentiful
So
Savor it
And don't eat it all at once,  because that way, there's nothing left to enjoy
And now, take a little swallow of vodka while it's still in your mouth
You haven't been with many women, have you
Not on Sundays
And you've never had caviar before, have you
No, ma'am
When I was 1 9,  I attempted to become the first woman ever to swim the English Channel
Really
But the current that day was so strong that,  for every stroke I took, I was pushed back two
I was in the water for 32 hours
And when I was two miles from Calais,  it started to rain
That's it
Steady on
When I couldn't go any further,  I stopped
I just stopped
And everybody asked me, would I try again
For why wouldn't l
But I never did
As a matter of fact, I’ve never done anything with my life after that
Your hands are so coarse
I can feel the wind in your cheek
I’m afraid it's the witching hour
It was the first time a woman had ever kissed me
It’s something you never forget
I think you make me feel younger
You make me feel years younger, too
I wish I was
So many things I’d change
I’d undo all my mistakes
What mistakes
I kept waiting, you know
Thinking that I’d do something to change my circumstances
Do something
Such an awful waste
You never get it back
Wasted time
lf we're going to have an affair,  you're never to look at me during the day
And we're always to part before sunrise
And we will never say "I love you.
Those are the rules
Are you cold
I’m freezing
Oh, you
You're frozen
What an idiot, I’m standing here in this fur
How thoughtless of me
She was the first woman that ever loved me
You want me to skip some
No, I’m glad he had somebody to keep him warm
"I couldn't wait to see her again.
We saw each other every night
We always used the same room
But each time seemed new and different
Come here
Elizabeth
Good night
Until one night
Yesterday, December 7th, 1 941 ,  a date which will live in infamy...  It’s a meeting, a policy meeting regarding your future,  possibly beyond
There's been a change of plan, lads
As you may or may not know,  the Japs bombed Pearl Harbor yesterday
Frank D. Roosevelt’s asked each of us to do our part
The Chelsea's been commissioned to serve in the United States Navy
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue
Anybody doesn't want to go to war, now is the time to say so
Once you set foot on that boat, you're in the Navy, friend
Yeah, I’ve been meaning to talk with you, Mike
My wife's doing poorly
I’d like to maybe see her one more time
You're free to make your way home any way you can, Mr. Mayes
Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook
Food poisoning's one of the leading causes of death at sea
Right after inadequate safety equipment
I can cook, Captain
Been doing it all my life
I don't know
You're a little moody for war, Benjamin
What the hell
I’ll take any man wants to kick the shite out of the Japs and the Huns
That's it, pack your gear
We're going to war, gentlemen
She had left a note
She wrote, "It was nice to have met you.
And that was it
It wasn't the war any of us expected
We would just tow crippled ships, scraps of metal, really
lf there was a war, we didn't see it
There was a man assigned to us
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy
But most of all, he loved America
There is no other country in the world
When you spell America


His name was Dennis Smith, and he was a fullblooded Cherokee
His family had been Americans for over 500 years
These pacifists
They say they won't fight on conscience
Now, where would be if everybody decided to act  according to their conscience
Keep it down, would you, Chief
Hey
I’ve been watching you
You seem trustworthy
lf something happens to me,  could you see that this gets to my wife
He'd given me all of his pay
Hadn't spent a dime of it
I want my family to know I was thinking about them
All hands on deck
Get your asses up here, you lazy bastards
The war had finally found us
All stop
Pleasant, man that light
A transport carrying 1 ,300 men had been split by a torpedo
We were first to arrive at the scene
Cut the engines
All stop
We were the only sound
Fellas
Sub
We sure as hell can't outrun them fuckers
Battle stations
Thank you, Chief
What
Is that the last one
Captain
They shot the hell out of my painting
Give me your other hand
You’ll be all right, Captain
They got a nice spot in Heaven waiting for you
Nice spot
You can be as mad as a mad dog at the way things went
You could swear, curse the Fates
But when it comes to the end,  you have to let go
Captain
Thirteen hundred and twenty eight men died that day
I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis Smith
John Grimm, who was right, he was gonna die there
I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money
I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody,  and to Mike Clark, captain of the tugboat Chelsea
I said goodbye to all the other men who had dreams of their own,  ail the men who wanted to be insurance salesmen  or doctors or lawyers or lndian chiefs
This don't get fixed
Out here, death didn't seem natural
I’d never seen a hummingbird that far out to sea
Before or since
And in May of 1 945, when I was 26 years old,  I came home
I’m ready
I’m ready
I’m coming
I’m ready
All right, I’m coming, Miss Alfalina
Queenie
Yes
Sweet Jesus
Oh, you're home
Oh, Lord, you came back
Let me look at you
Who's that, Mama
Child, it's your brother, Benjamin
I didn't know he was my brother
There's a shitload of things you don't know, child
Get on out there and finish sweeping
Come here, wash your hands, help me with the table
Go on, now
Turn around
You look like you've been born again
Younger than the springtime
I think that preacher laid hands on you gave you a second life
I knew it that moment I saw you, you were special
I telic you what, my knees are sore,  'cause I’ve been on them every night asking the Lord,  I said, "God, just bring him home safely.
Remember what I told you
"You never know what's coming for you?
That's right
Sit down
Well, you learn anything worth repeating
I sure saw some things
Oh, you seen some pain
Some joy, too
Sure
Sure, I did
Yeah, that's what I want to hear
Look at you
Where's Tizzy
Oh, baby
Mr. Weathers died in his sleep one night last April
Mama, I’m so sorry
Don't you worry about that, baby
Yeah, well, it's only one or two of them left now
They all just about new
Guess they're waiting their turn like everybody else, huh
I’m so glad you're back home with me
Now, we're gonna have to find you a wife and a new job
That's right
Come on in here, help me with this table
Benjamin
You're wasting your time, baby
She's stone deaf
Oh, and you’ll be staying in what was Mrs. DeSeroux's old room
You're too big to be rooming with anybody else
It’s a funny thing about coming home
Looks the same, smells the same, feels the same
Did I ever telic you I’ve been struck by lightning seven times
Once when I was sitting in my truck, just minding my own business
You realize what's changed is you
And late one morning, not long after I’d been back..
Thank you
Hey
Excuse me, is Queenie here
Daisy
It’s me, Benjamin
Benjamin
Oh, my God
Of course it's you
Benjamin
How are you
It’s been such a long time
There's so much I want to know
When did you get back
Well, I got back a few weeks ago
I spoke to Queenie, she said you were in the war, somewhere at sea
We were so, so worried about you
Oh, I’m okay
Well, look at you
You're so lovely
You stopped writing
"When I had left, she was a girl
And a woman had taken her place
"She was the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen.
Beautiful
"The most beautiful.
You remember Grandma Fuller
Why, sure I do
She passed
I heard that
I’m sorry
I just can't believe we're both here
Must be fate
No, no, what do they call it
Kismet
Do you know about Edgar Cayce, the psychic
I don't believe l. 

He says that everything is predetermined,  but I like to think of it as fate
I’m not sure how it works, but I’m glad it happened
Have you been to Manhattan
It’s right across the river from me
Now, I can see the Empire State Building  if I stand on my bed
What about you
Where have you been
Tell me everything
Last time you wrote, you said you'd been to Russia
I’ve always wanted to go to Russia
Is it as cold as they say
Twice as cold
My goodness
We always said you were different
But I think you really are
You wrote that you met somebody
Did it work out
It ran its course
Hey, do you remember this
"This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo  "at 5:00 in the afternoon.
Would you like to have dinner
Did I telic you that I danced for Balanchine
Oh, he's a famous choreographer
He said that I had perfect line
You know, in a rehearsal once, a dancer fell
And he just..
He just put it right into the production
I mean, can you imagine that
Like in a..
In a classical ballet
You know, a dancer, intentionally falling
There's a whole new word for dance now
It’s called "abstract.
No, he's not the only one, though
There's Lincoln Kirstein and Lucia Chase, and oh, my...  Oh, there's Agnes de Mille
She's just torn up all those conventions,  you know, ail that straightupanddown stuff
It’s not about the formality of the dance, it's about what the dancer's feeling
As she told me about this big new world,  names that didn't mean a thing to me,  I didn't really hear very much of what she was saying
It’s new and it's modern and it's American
They understand our vigor and our physicality
Oh, my God
I’ve just been talking and talking
No, no, I’ve enjoyed listening
I didn't know you smoked
I’m old enough
I’m old enough for a lot of things
In New York, we stay up all night,  watch the sun come up over the warehouses
There's always something to do
I have to go back tomorrow
So soon
Wish I could stay
Dancers don't need costumes or scenery anymore
I can imagine dancing completely naked
Have you read D. H 
Lawrence
Well


His books were banned
The words are like making love
In our company, we have to trust each other
Sex is a part of it
You know, a lot of the dancers are lesbians
There was one woman who wanted to sleep with me
Does that upset you
Which part
Somebody wanting to sleep with me
You're a desirable woman
I would think most of them would want to sleep with you
Let's go back to the house
Or we could get a room somewhere
We could lay down your jacket
I don't know, Daisy
It’s not that I wouldn't like to or anything
I think I’ll just disappoint you
Oh, Benjamin, I’ve been with older men
You're going back to New York in the morning
You should be with your friends
You're only young once
Oh, I’m old enough
Daisy, just not tonight, is all
We could go hear some music
Our lives are defined by opportunities
Even the ones we miss
You look so handsome and so distinguished
They're saying the hurricane's gonna miss us, blow right on by
Oh, that's great
I’ll stay under the blankets with Mother
She says nothing


Benjamin
"Things were becoming different

.
...for me
My hair had very little gray and grew like weeds
My sense of smell was keener
My hearing, more acute
I could walk further and faster
While everybody else was aging, I was getting younger, all alone
Come in
Benjamin
Do you remember me
Well, sure I do, Mr. Button
What happened to you
Darn foot
Got infected, so


Welcome home, my friend
I see you're still drinking your Sazerac with whiskey
Creature of habit
You still visiting the house on Bourbon Street
Not for a long time
Interesting times, though
We went from making 40,000 to nearly half a million buttons a day
We employed 1 0 times the number of people
We were operating around the clock
Damn shame
The war has been kind to the button industry
You know,  I’m sick
I don't know how much longer I have
I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Button
No


I don't have any people
I keep to myself
I hope you don't mind, but, whenever possible,  I’d enjoy your company
I’ll certainly do what I can
Benjamin, do you know anything about buttons
Now, Button's Buttons has been in our family for 1 24 years
My grandfather was a tailor, and he had a small shop in Richmond
After the Civil War, he moved to New Orleans,  where my father had the wisdom to make our own buttons
So, with his help, the tailor shop grew to this
And today, I can't sew a stitch
That's very, very interesting
You sure have done well for yourself
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Button
Benjamin
You're my son
I’m so sorry I never told you before
You were born the night the Great War ended
Your mother died giving birth to you
I thought you were a monster
I promised your mother I’d make sure you were safe
I should never have abandoned you
My mother
At the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain
When I was a boy, I’d love to wake up before anyone else,  run down to that lake and watch the day begin
It was as if I was the only one alive
I fell in love the first time I saw her
Your mother's name was Caroline Murphy
She worked in your grandfather's kitchen
She's from Dublin
In 1 903, Caroline and all her brothers and sisters came to live here,  in New Orleans
I’d find excuses to go down to that kitchen  just so I could look at her
April 25th, 1918
Happiest day of my life
The day I married your mother
Why didn't you just telic me
I plan on leaving everything I have to you
I have to go
Where
Home
And what does he think, anyway
He thinks he can just show up  and everything's supposed to be fine and dandy
Everybody's just supposed to be friends
Well, he got another thing coming, that's for sure
God be my witness, he got another thing coming
He left us $1 8 that night you was found
Eighteen ratty dollars  and a filthy diaper
Good night, Mama
Good night, baby
Did I ever telic you I was struck by lightning seven times
Once, I was walking my dog down the road
I’m blind in the one eye, can't hardly hear,  get twitches and shakes out of nowhere, always losing my line of thought
But you know what
God keeps reminding me I’m lucky to be alive
Storm's coming
May I help you, sir
Up the stairs, first bedroom
Thank you
Wake up
Let's get you dressed
Now that's something
Thank you
You can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went
You can swear and curse the Fates
But when it comes to the end,  you have to let go
Well, it sure is a beautiful service
He’ll be buried right next to your mother
You're my mother
My baby
Now, I’d never seen New York
Excuse me, I’m a friend of Daisy's
Right this way
Daisy has company
Daisy
Daisy
Yes
We need the wardrobe
Is somebody looking for me
Benjamin
Hi
What are you doing here
Thought I’d come visit
Spend some time with you, if I could
Oh, well, I wish you would've called
You took me by surprise
You can just throw them out
No
Thank you, they're lovely
I couldn't take my eyes off of you
I thought you were mesmerizing
Thank you
That's very kind of you to say
I better get changed
A group of us are going to a party
Would you want to come
Someone told me about a restaurant  I thought you might enjoy
I made a reservation, just in case
Just, all the dancers go out after the show
You're


You're welcome to come with us
I’ll get changed
All right
She choreographs for the Ballets Russes
She's divine
You were breathtaking
Sweetie
This is David
He dances with the company
This is Benjamin
Who
I told you about him
Oh, yeah
How you doing
I’ll go get you a drink
All right
Thanks
So, you were a friend of her grandmother's
Or something like that
Something like that
Hey, excuse me
Come on
Hey
Now, I had no idea you were coming
Lord, Benjamin
What did you expect
What, you want me to drop everything
Now, this is my life
Babe
You going downtown
Come on
You’ll have a good time
There's lots of musicians, interesting people
You don't have to do that
This is my fault
I should've called
I thought I’d come here  and sweep you off your feet or something
Daisy
Come on
Let's go
Be right there
Seems nice
Do you love him
I think so
I’m happy for you
Maybe I’ll see you at home
Okay
I enjoyed the show
He came to telic me his father had died
You couldn't have known
I was 23. l. 

I just didn't care
What did you do next
Some photographs, I think, in the front of my bag
I was as good a dancer as I was ever gonna be
For five years, l. 

I danced everywhere
London, Vienna, Prague
I’ve never seen these
Mom
You never talked about your dancing
Well, I was the only American  to be invited to dance with the Bolshoi, sugar
It was glorious
But Benjamin was never far from my thoughts
And I’d find myself saying...  Good night, Benjamin
"Good night, Daisy.
He said that
"Life wasn't all that complicated
"If you want, you might say I was looking for something.
Benjamin
Mrs. La Tourneau just passed
Letter for Mr. Benjamin Button
That'd be me
Thank you
Miss Daisy Fuller
Just a minute
Please have a seat
Sure
Sometimes we're on a collision course and we just don't know it
Whether it's by accident or by design, there's not a thing we can do about it
A woman in Paris was on her way to go shopping
But she had forgotten her coat, went back to get it
When she had gotten her coat, the phone had rung
So she had stopped to answer it and talked for a couple of minutes
While the woman was on the phone,  Daisy was rehearsing for a performance at the Paris Opera House
And while she was rehearsing, the woman, off the phone now,  had gone outside to get a taxi
Now, a taxi driver had dropped off a fare earlier,  and had stopped to get a cup of coffee
And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing
And this cab driver, who dropped off the earlier fare  and had stopped to get the cup of coffee,  he picked up the lady who was going shopping  and had missed getting the earlier cab
The taxi had to stop for a man crossing the street,  who had left for work five minutes later than he normally did  because he forgot to set his alarm
While that man, late for work, was crossing the street,  Daisy had finished rehearsing and was taking a shower
And while Daisy was showering,  the taxi was waiting outside a boutique for the woman to pick up a package  which hadn't been wrapped yet,  because the girl who was supposed to wrap it  had broken up with her boyfriend the night before and forgot
When the package was wrapped, the woman, who was back in the cab,  was blocked by a delivery truck
All the while, Daisy was getting dressed
The delivery truck pulled away, and the taxi was able to move  while Daisy, the last to be dressed,  waited for one of her friends who had broken a shoelace
While the taxi was stopped, waiting for a traffic light,  Daisy and her friend came out the back of the theater
And if only one thing had happened differently,  if that shoelace hadn't broken  or that delivery truck had moved moments earlier  or that package had been wrapped and ready  because the girl hadn't broken up with her boyfriend,  or that man had set his alarm and got up five minutes earlier  or that taxi driver hadn't stopped for a cup of coffee  or that woman had remembered her coat and got into an earlier cab,  Daisy and her friend would have crossed the street  and the taxi would have driven by
But, life being what it is,  a series of intersecting lives and incidents  out of anyone's control,  that taxi did not go by,  and that driver was momentarily distracted
Daisy
And that taxi hit Daisy
Daisy
Help
And her leg was crushed
Daisy
Who told you
Your friend wired me
Very kind of you to come all this way to see that I was all right
You'd do the same for me
My God
Look at you
You're perfect
I wish you hadn't come here
I don't want you to see me like this
Her leg had been broken in five places
And with therapy and time, she might walk again
But she'd never dance
I’m gonna take you home with me
I want to look after you
I’m not going back to New Orleans
Then I’ll stay here in Paris
Don't you understand
I don't want your help
I know I’m feeling sorry for myself, but I don't want to be with you
Tried to telic you that in New York
You don't listen
You might change your mind
We are not little children anymore, Benjamin
Just stay out of my life
I was awfully cruel
He didn't understand
I couldn't have him see me like that
"I didn't leave right away
"I stayed in Paris for a while to look out for her.
I never knew that
Oh, darling, could you get the nurse
I taught myself to walk again
I took the train to Lourdes
Let's take a look
That's normal
Pulse rate is slowing
She is gonna struggle to breathe
Will you be all right
Yeah
All right, he says, "I went back home.
And then there's a lot of pages torn out
"I listened to the sound of the house.
I read that already
He


He spilt something on it, so it's hard to read, Mom
Something about sailing, does that make sense
I learned to sail an old boat of my father's from the lake house
I can't lie
I did enjoy the company of a woman or two
Or maybe three
Don't know why you bother, Sam, just gonna be there again tomorrow
Mama
And in the spring of 1 962,  she came back
You want to know where I’ve been
No
How come you didn't write or nothing
Just disappearing like that
It was something I needed to do for myself
Yeah, well, I never took you to be the selfish type
I sure hope I’m not wrong
I’m usually not wrong about people
Good night, Mama
Good night, baby
Y'all have fun
You haven't said two words
I don't want to ruin it
Sleep with me
Absolutely
I asked her to come away with me
We sailed into the Gulf along the Florida Keys
I am so glad we didn't find one another when I was 26
Why do you say that
I was so young
And you were so old
It happened when it was supposed to happen
I will enjoy each and every moment I have with you
I bet I can stay out here longer than you
I bet you can't
Barely a line or a crease
Every day I have more wrinkles
It’s not fair
I love your wrinkles
Both of them
What's it like growing younger
I can't really say
I’m always looking out my own eyes
Will you still love me when my skin grows old and saggy
Will you still love me when I have acne
When I wet the bed
When I’m afraid of what's under the stairs
What
What are you thinking
Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts
And what a shame that is
Some things last
Good night, Daisy
Good night, Benjamin
Mom
When did you meet Dad
Some time after that
Did you telic him about this Benjamin
He knew enough, darling
Mama
Queenie
Hello
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin
Where is everybody
Oh, Benjamin
Queenie died
I’m so sorry
I’m so sorry for your loss
She was a great woman
Our deepest condolences
We buried her beside her beloved Mr. Weathers
And so we might have memories of our own,  we sold my father's house on Esplanade
It is a wonderful old place, darling
I think we are going to be so happy here
Oh, what a long family history you have
They come with the house
Come on
You have to see the master suite
We bought ourselves a duplex
I loved that house
It smelled like firewood
Don't


Don't stop, darling
"It was one of the happiest times of my life.
We didn't have a stick of furniture
We would have picnics in the living room
We ate when we felt like it
Stayed up all night when we wanted
We vowed never to fall into routine,  to go to bed or wake up at the same time
We lived on that mattress
Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam, was a physical therapist
We lived four blocks from a public pool
You know, you might've got a few more years out of it,  but you chose to do something so special and unique  that there was only a short window of time you could do it
So, even if nothing ever happened,  you'd still be right here where you are now
I just don't like getting old
They put too much chlorine in here
I promise you I’ll never lose myself to selfpity again
And I think right there and then  she realized none of us is perfect forever
She found peace
She opened a studio and taught young girls how to dance
And tendu
Come back the other way
And spot, spot, spot
Excellent
Good night, Miss Daisy
Good night
You certainly are beautiful to watch
Dancing's all about the line
The line of your body
Sooner or later, you lose that line, and you never get it back
I figure, you were born in 1 91 8, 49 years ago
I’m 43
We are almost the same age
We're meeting in the middle
We finally caught up with each other
Wait
I want to remember us just as we are now
I’m pregnant
You know, I swear the nurse slipped and said it was a boy
But I think it's a girl
I know you're afraid
I’m not hiding it
Okay
What's your worst fear
Baby born like me
Then I will love it all the more
Okay
How can I be a father when I’m heading in the other direction
It’s not fair to a child
I don't want to be anybody's burden
Sugar, we all end up in diapers
I am gonna make this work
I want this, and I want it with you
I want you to have everything you want, all of it
I’m just not sure how to reconcile this
Would you telic a blind man he couldn't have children
Here you go
You’ll be a father for as long as you can
I know the consequences
I’ve accepted that
Loving you is worth everything to me
I have to go pee
The oldest woman to ever swim the English Channel  arrived here today in Calais...  Keep it
...having made the swim in 34 hours,  22 minutes and 1 4 seconds
The 68yearold Elizabeth Abbott arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,  exhausted but happy
Miss Abbott, how would you sum up, in words, this achievement
I suppose..
Anything's possible
All right
Yes
Thank you
You ready
Thank you very much
Thank you
Thank you all
Yeah
You're very kind
In the spring, on a day like any other...  I’ll be back in an hour
Honey
Go and call an ambulance
The baby's coming
Operator, I need an ambulance
The baby's coming
271 4 Napoleon
There you go
Keep breathing
Deep breaths
Push
There we go
Everyone's fine
She's a perfectly healthy baby girl
Honey
She gave birth to a five pound, four ounce baby girl
Did you count the toes
She's perfect
"And we named her for my mother, Caroline.
This Benjamin was my father
And this is how you telic me
Excuse me
...because all the ingredients are there for a major storm,  possibly even up to a Category 5
Hey, I know it's hard
You can't smoke in here
Nobody can telic you exactly where it's gonna hit,  but we have to go with the guidance that we have,  incorporate that information and then pass it along to you
"You grew as the doctor had promised, normal and healthy.
You're gonna have to find a real father for her
What are you talking about
She's gonna need someone to grow old with
She’ll learn to accept whatever happens
She loves you
Honey, she needs a father, not a playmate
Is it me
Of course not
Is my age beginning to bother you
Of course not
Is that what you're telling me
You can't raise the both of us
It was your first birthday
We had a party for you
The house was filled with children
How are you
Hey, man
Before you turn around, they’ll be in high school, dating
I sold the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain,  I sold Button's Buttons,  I sold my father's sailboat, put it all into a savings account
And so that you and your mother might have a life,  I left, before you could ever remember me
"I left with just the clothes on my back.
I don't want to read this now
Can you just telic me where he went
I don't really know
It’s for me
1 970
I was two
"Happy Birthday
"I wish I could have kissed you good night.
They're all for me
Five
"I wish I could have taken you to your first day of school.
Six
"I wish I could have been there to teach you to play piano.
1 981 , 1 3
"I wish I could have told you not to chase some boy
"I wish I could have held you when you had a broken heart
"I wish I could have been your father
Nothing I ever did will replace that.
I guess he went to India
"For what it's worth, it's never too late,  "or, in my case, too early

.
...or, in my case, too early,  to be whoever you want to be
There's no time limit
Start whenever you want
You can change or stay the same
There are no rules to this thing
We can make the best or the worst of it
And I hope you make the best of it
I hope you see things that startle you
I hope you feel things you never felt before
I hope you meet people with a different point of view
I hope you live a life you're proud of
And if you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength  to start all over again
"

.start all over again.
He had been gone a long time
I’ll see you next Thursday
Good night, Miss Daisy
Oh, good night, sweetheart
I’m sorry, we're closing
Can I help you
Are you here to pick somebody up
Why did you come back
Mom
You ready yet
Mom, what's wrong
I was just hearing a very sad story about a mutual friend  who I hadn't seen for a very long time
Caroline, this is Benjamin
You knew him when you were just a baby
Hi
Hi
Hey
Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you were done
Oh, this is a friend of my family's
Benjamin Button, this is my husband, Robert
How do you do
A pleasure
Well, it was very nice to meet you
We’ll be in the car, darling
All right
Bye
I’m just locking up
Wow
She's beautiful
Like her mother
Does she dance
Not very well
I guess that'd be from my side of things
She's a dear, sweet girl
She seems a little lost
But then, who isn't at 1 2
A lot of her reminds me of you
My husband, he's a widower, or was


Was a widower
He's an incredibly kind, just bright, adventurous man
He's been a terrific father
Good
You are so much younger
Only on the outside
You were right
I couldn't have been raising both of you
I’m not that strong
So, where are you staying
What are you gonna do
I’m staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel on the Avenue
I don't know what I’m gonna do
But


They're waiting
I remember that
That was him
The hurricane has changed directions
It’s going to make landfall sometime soon
Am I supposed to do something
Arrangements are being made  to move people, but it's up to you
No
No, we're


We're staying
I’ll let you know if anything changes
"That night, while I was sitting and wondering why I came back at all,  "there was a knock at the door.
Come in
Are you all right
I’m sorry, I don't know what I’m doing here
Nothing lasts
I have never stopped loving you
Oh, but, Benjamin, I’m an old woman now
Some things you never forget
...so few people even know  that you were ever in jail in the first place
I’ll telic you, I am sick about it, too,  because, please, if they're not gonna give you an award  like "Man of the Year," at least what they could do  is stop having you listed as an exconvict  which I think is, again, so unfair
Good night, Benjamin
Good night, Daisy
And as I knew I would, I watched her go
That's the last thing he wrote
Sometime after your father passed,  there was a call
Hello
Yes, speaking
I’m sorry, I don't understand
It’s the corner house
Come on in
I’m Daisy Fuller
I’m David Hernandez,  with the Orleans Parish Department of Child Welfare Services
He was living in a condemned building
The police found this with him
This address
It’s got your name in it a lot
He's in very poor health
He was taken to the hospital
He doesn't seem to know who or where he is
He's very confused
I was telling Mr. Hernandez that Benjamin is one of us
lf he needs a place to stay, it's all right, he can stay here
Benjamin
You play beautifully
He doesn't seem to like to be touched
He goes in and out of states of recognition
The doctors say, if they didn't know any better,  he has the beginnings of dementia
Do you remember me
I’m Daisy
I’m Benjamin
It’s nice to meet you, Benjamin
Would you mind if I sit with you
I would love to hear you play
Do I know you
I want some breakfast
And every day,  I would stop by to make sure that he was comfortable
No, I didn't
You just finished eating
Don't think I don't know what you're doing
You're all fucking liars
He doesn't believe he just had his breakfast
Now, why don't we see  if we can't find something else for you to do
I have a feeling there's a lot of things I can't remember
Well, like what, sugar
It’s like there's this whole life I had,  and I can't remember what it was
It’s okay
It’s okay to forget things
Many times, he would simply forget who or where he was
There he is, he's up there on the roof
It wasn't easy
Benjamin
I can see everything
I can see the big river
That's right,  you can see everything, sweetheart
I can see the graveyard where Mama's buried,  and all those other people
I want you to come down
What if I could fly
I knew a man who could fly
You come down and I’ll telic you all about him
Somebody go up there
He was five when I moved in
Nearly the same age I was when I had met him
"This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo  "at 5:00 in the afternoon  "when he had got his beautiful hind legs.
The days passed
And I watched as he forgot how to walk  and how to talk
What's my name
I’m Daisy
Can you say "Daisy"
In 2002, they put up a new clock in that train station
And in the spring of 2003,  he looked at me  and I knew that he knew who I was
And then he closed his eyes as if to go to sleep
I wish I’d known him
Now you do
Mom, I think I should go see what's going on
Good night, Benjamin
We're expecting flash flooding after the levee break
It occurred in the Ninth Ward
Some people are born to sit by a river
Some get struck by lightning
Some have an ear for music
Some are artists
Some swim
Some know buttons
Some know Shakespeare
<i><b>http://t3ll4v1s10nddl.blogspot.com</b></i>  Some are mothers
Financial times, 100 index of 11 points just above the key 3,800 level
As for the rest of Europe, Frankfurt's DAX gaining 9 points to 25.32
In Paris, the CAC40 losing 7, the weaker franc weighing on the market
Thank you, Ilsa
Have a nice day
...actually are on time this morning according to dispatchers
San Francisco's freeways are...  Good morning, Sir
Well, tell me what we're supposed to do
I mean, you may be perched on majority shares,  but we all get fucked if the actuals crash
That old man is going to sink us
Soon as I have BaerGrant's P and L report in hand  I will be speeddialing your number
Is that a promise
I'm sorry, I'm not aware of that term
Well, what do I do if Anson calls about substantiation procedure
Take evasive action
Have your secretary say you're in a meeting
Thank you, Jack
Yes, Maria
Invitations
Mmmhmm
The museum gala
No
The Fitzwilliam botanical annual fundraiser
No
The Hinchberger wedding
Hinchberger wedding
Tuxedos, droning conversations
I don't think so
No
I'll send your regrets
Honestly, why must I bother
You don't know about society, Maria
You don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it
Yes
I have an Elizabeth on line 3
Your exwife
I know who it is
Take a message
Oh, happy birthday, sir
Thank you, Maggie
I don't like her
I wouldn't even mention the following, but he was very insistent
It's obviously some sort of prank
What
Well, a gentleman called requesting to have lunch with you
I tried to assure him that you were very busy... What's his name
A Mr. Seymour Butts
Under the Bleachers by Seymour Butts
I'm sorry
Cancel my lunch
Make a reservation at the City Club for myself and Mr. Butts
My usual table
Maria, put the reservation under my name
You ready to order, sir
No, I'm still waiting
This was ice tea
Conrad, what a surprise
Happy birthday, Nickie
Seymour Butts
I'll never get tired of that one
That's why it's a classic
This is a nice restaurant
They gave me a free jacket
I'm sure they're gonna want it back
I remember being here a long time ago
Yeah, I took you here once
No
I used to buy crystal meth off the maitre d'
Oh, really
In college
Which college
Touch
Miss me
As much as that's possible
You look good
So do you
To think I was worried
Worried about me
How long has it been since Mom's funeral
Two, three years
I thought you quit
I did
It didn't take
Well, you can't smoke here
I'm with you
It's illegal to smoke in restaurants in California
Fuck California
How are you
Couldn't be better
Elizabeth
We're divorced
She remarried a pediatrician or a gynecologist,  or a pediatric gynecologist
Lives in, uh, Sausalito
That's too bad
I liked her
And what about you
What, you don't keep track of me anymore
Not since family week at rehab
So what brings you to town, Conrad
Everything all right
Yeah
Need anything
Nope
Really
No I don't need anything from you
I just  found myself laying naked on the beach near Ibiza,  and all of a sudden it clicked
October 12th
Nickie's birthday
October 11th
Whatever
This is for you
You shouldn't have
What do you get for the man who has everything
"Consumer Recreation Services. 
Well, I do have golf clubs
Call that number
Why
It'll make your life fun
Fun
You know what that is
You've seen other people have it
It's an entertainment service
An escort service
A profound life experience
Sorry
I'll just...  No, that's all right
Just...  Tell me you'll call
I said I would
No, you didn't
You still on medication
Why would you say that
You gentlemen ready to order
I didn't mean it the way it sounded
I'm not on anything
I'm not even seeing a shrink
And I feel great
Do you mind
I think you'll like this
I did
And it was the best thing that ever happened to me
I'll call them
Do it
For you
I said I'll call, okay
All right, I'll call
It's just that, uh, I hate surprises
I know
Happy birthday to you  Happy birthday, Mr. Van Orton  Happy birthday to you  Thank you
Someone's got to fly to Seattle and drive a stake through Anson's heart
Have you seen the profitability report
You can imagine how much more unhappy I am
So, you're gonna deal with Anson
That's correct
We're furious
Sleep well, Nicholas
I will
Good night, Ilsa
Dinner's in the oven
Thank you
Oh, I saw Conrad today
Did you
How is he
He's okay
I think he's in one of those  personal improvement cults or something
Well, send my love if you see him again
Happy birthday
Goodnight
Aw
...from companies that defaulted on their payments
The FCC expects to receive more than $500 million in bids  as the licenses eagerly soar...  Elizabeth, good evening
Happy birthday, Nickie
1140
You almost missed it this year
Have you had a nice birthday
Does Rose Kennedy have a black dress
I went, not once, but twice through the spanking machine
I can only imagine
How are you
Connie asked me the same thing today
Connie
Really
I've always liked your brother
Anyway..
I..
I just thought  this might be difficult for you...  Just another birthday
...because of your father
That's right
He was 48, wasn't he
I hadn't really thought about it until now
Why do I call
I honestly don't know
Please send Dr. Mel and Rachel my best
She has a little brother on the way
We did the ultrasound
Official nuclear family
You must be very pleased
We are
We are very pleased
Well, it's good to talk with you
I guess I should let you go
Take care of yourself
You too, Nicholas
I mean that
I really do
Uhhuh
Be well
Bye
A proposal to encourage small businesses to provide their employees  with health insurance is now being debated by Washington legislators
The bill which attaches a smallbusiness health plan  to those of larger corporations  is receiving initial support from a number of key Republican leaders
However, Democratic lawmakers are voicing serious concerns  about the bill, claiming that it would undermine local efforts..
I just wanna make sure that we understand each other
Once you get it down on paper then you can count on my full support
We understand that
Thank you
We'll talk soon
Well, you shouldn't feel this reflects negatively on you
I do feel that it reflects negatively on me
I received this... Just a moment
I took these tests in good faith
I'm sorry you feel that way
I understand
We hope we haven't caused you any inconvenience
Thank you for choosing CRS
Mr. Feingold, could you assist this gentleman
Oh, yeah
Sure
Jim Feingold, VP Engineering, Data Analysis
I don't know exactly how this works
My brother sent me this card...  Oh, here we go
Yeah
... as a gift
All right, excellent
Well, let's get started
Yeah, I'm sorry about the... You know, all this hullabaloo here
We're, uh... Well, we're still moving
I got an office around here somewhere
You mind holding that
Thank you very much
Thank you
Are you hungry
New Moon Cafe
No, thank you
Next to Chinatown
A gift from Conrad Van Orton
Interesting
What is
Well, your brother was a client with our London branch
We do a sort of informal scoring,  and his numbers are outstanding
Really
Hmm
You sure you're not hungry
No, thank you
Okay, fine
Now, you need to fill out these forms
There's an application  and then a couple of psychtests there
A MNPI and a PAP
Oh, uh, for the financial questionnaire,  don't answer anything you don't feel like
We'll run our TRW
"I sometimes hurt small animals, true or false"
"I feel guilty when I masturbate. 
Well, I don't write the questions
I just review the answers
What is this for
Well, to give us an overall sense of your capability...  No, what is this for
What are you selling
Oh
It's a game
A game
Specifically tailored for each participant
Think of it as a great vacation
Except you don't go to it,  it comes to you
What... What kind of vacation
It's different every time
Humor me with specifics
We provide  whatever's lacking
And what if nothing is lacking
May I make two suggestions
You really think that I'll participate without knowing any...  First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing
Second, you don't have to decide today
Take the silly test, fill out the stupid forms
One day, your game begins
You either love it or hate it
Decide then
You know we... We are like  an experiential bookofthemonth club
You can drop out at any time with no further obligation
That was my sales pitch
How long will this take
About an hour for those, another hour for the physical
Physical
It's a cursory examination,  turnyourhead, cough sort of thing
You'll be out of here in no time
Confused
Risky
Bloody
Whoops
Mr. Sutherland called about BaerGrant Publishing
Cancel it
Push it back till Wednesday
And Anson Baer called about tomorrow
Tomorrow
Yes, that's correct
How much longer is this going to take
Shouldn't be long
We're almost done
You said that two hours ago
All right
Put it back until tomorrow
Selection before the following emotional responses
You have 0.9 seconds to enter your emotional response
Reaction time is a factor
Please make a selection for the following emotional responses
You have 0.9 seconds to enter your emotional response
Does this thing end
I'm sorry to keep you waiting
Oh, don't worry
It's been just terrific spending my entire day  with your crack team
Well, it's all down to this
This is an insurance company requirement
It states that you're aware  that the game exists, that you're a willing participant in said game,  so on and so forth
Our guarantee, payment's entirely  at your brother's discretion as a gift
It's dependent on your satisfaction
Does that mean that if I'm not happy he doesn't have to pay
That's never happened
We've never had an unsatisfied customer
I think you mean, dissatisfied
That's right
You're a leftbrained word fetishist
Initials, initials, and sign there  in blood
Just kidding
All right
Now, your copy will be at the front desk in this folder
And I'll... Keep the pen
We'll let you know
What about Monday or Tuesday
No, that's bad for me
Well, how about tonight
Well, I'm working all this evening
Wednesday is the only possibility right now
Do you wanna do dinner
Okay
By the way, I went to CRS
Really
What did you think
Well they seemed just a little bit disorganized
Well, when I did it in London they'd been around a while
Are you gonna do this
No, I haven't decided yet
Telling you, it's like getting in on the ground floor of the next Disneyland
CRS won't go public
They're familyowned
Stranger things have happened
No, they haven't, actually
They opened here
The game in San Francisco
See
They're doing fine without any of us
Nicholas
How are you
James, good evening
Good evening, sir
We have new members here
Believe so, sir
Put their next round on me
Got you, sir
No, no, no, no
Last time I played Pebble I swore I'd never pick up another club again
Speaking about games...  Couldn't help but overhear you talking about CRS
Well, the reason I mention it is I took the test today at the Montgomery Street office
You did
Kudos
So, yours hasn't started yet
No, not yet
That was one of the questions I had for you
What is it
Oh, what is it
The eternal question
You know, I envy you
I wish I could go back and do it for the first time all over again
Here's to new experiences
Hmm, if you'll excuse me, I got to go
Good night, Ted
Nicholas
Nice to meet you
So, you played recently
Oh, about a year ago
I was working in Los Angeles
Oh, I hear the London office is very good, too..
It sounds like a lot of fantasy, roleplaying nonsense, though
You wanna know what it is
What it's all about
John chapter 0 verse 25
I, um,  haven't been to Sunday school in a long time
"Whereas once I was blind,  "now I can see. 
Good night, Nicholas
Best of luck
Goodnight
If the BaerGrant meeting  is not held tomorrow  may as well not be held at all
When Mr. Van Orton boards his plane on the morrow  he will have every agreement and addendum in the complete closing package  flawlessly revised
So you will miss another opera you would have slept during anyway
We now have an opportunity to show our clients  how well we will rise to his exhilarating challenge
Yes
Nicholas Van Orton
Who is this
This is Cynthia from CRS
How did you get this number
We've finished processing your application
Look, I'm in a meeting right now
I'm afraid it was rejected
I beg your pardon
You shouldn't feel this reflects negatively on you
We hope we haven't caused you any inconvenience
Oh, this is ridiculous
Thank you for thinking of CRS
Anything wrong
Uh, no
No, nothing's...  You may hang up or press pound for more options
Oh, this is Conrad
Leave a message
Yes, Connie, it's Nicholas
Give me a ring when you get in
Oh, uh, regarding your birthday present,  um, things are a little crazy right now
I don't really know if I can fit it in my schedule
But we'll talk about it at dinner tomorrow
Thanks, bye
Hello
...the resulting rise of unemployment and decline  into buyable small businesses
Meanwhile, Republican leaders argue that this passage  would be the very stimulant that a sluggish economy needs
No one has expressed an opinion as to how it will impact  the pampered existence of Nicholas Van Orton
The one thing on which both Democrats and Republicans seem to agree  is that most Americans harbor serious doubts about the economic future
A recent poll suggests a staggering 57% of American workers believe  there is a very real chance they will be unemployed within the next 5 to 7 years
But what does that matter to a bloated millionaire fat cat like you
In other financial news, stock markets rose both domestically and abroad today  after the announcement of stronger than expected earnings  by several high tech companies  but dipped again reacting to reports that Nicholas Van Orton had sneezed
Are you gonna spend the rest of the evening prying at that clown's mouth
I..
I don't..
It's frustrating for me if you don't pay attention
What is this
This is your game, Nicholas, and welcome to it
I'm here to let you in on a few ground rules
You received the very first key, and others will follow
You'll never know where you'll find them or how you'll need to use them
So keep your eyes open
How do you... You can see me
Let us save the questions till afterwards
How does this work
There's a tiny camera looking at you right now
It's impossible
You're right, impossible
You're having a conversation with your television
It's miniaturized
You know how dangerous that is
Mr. Van Orton
And in domestic news,  in Southern California..
Yes, Ilsa
What is it
Is everything all right
It's fine
It's...  ...in the petroleum processing plant yesterday
I've finished for the evening
Will you be needing anything else
No, I won't, Ilsa
Thank you
Good night
Good night, then
...in a petroleum processing plant yesterday
Several workers were injured in the... Who was that
Never mind who that is
You wanna know how a camera got into your home, don't you
Yes, I would
Cold
Colder
Warm
Warmer
Write this number down
It's a 24hour Consumer Recreation Services hotline
For emergencies only
But don't call asking what the object of the game is
Figuring that out is the object of the game
Good luck and congratulations on choosing CRS
...regret to have the American ambassador expelled after the incident
US State Department responded quickly with a formal apology
An announcement of the ambassador's immediate voluntary removal...  Hey, buddy, spare any change
Help me out here, huh
Huh
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
May I help you
What is it
What
Thank you
Buddy
Can you help me out
I need some toilet paper
I ran out
Just... Just go into the next stall
Come on, help me out
Hello
Hello
Didn't expect to see you here
I wanted to wish you luck
Been up all night
I checked it
Personally
I appreciate that, Sam
Why don't you go home and get some sleep
You're sure you don't want me along
No, I'll be fine
Hmm, nice shirt
Don't ask
Ciao
All of these years,  the first time ever you've stepped foot in these offices,  it's to ask me to step down
You promised to meet the projections, Anson
$1.60 a share is what you said
I don't think this visit comes as a surprise
Projections were far too optimistic
Admittedly, yes
Our EPS was 150 last quarter
We're up 6 cents..
The expectations were 10, and in this case the expectations meant everything
Will you really hold me to it over pennies
My stock is falling
I don't know about yours
Those pennies are costing millions
Give me...  Give me next quarter
If you still feel this way, vote your shares...  Today is what counts, Anson
You...  You intractable son of a bitch
If your father could see you now
What
Your father was a friend
A friend
God damn it
I've watched you grow up
Because you went fishing with my father I should sit on my hands  while you're throwing my money away
I will tell you..
I'm not finished
Now, you misspoke before when you said you're stepping down
I am firing you
Action is taken
Confidence is restored
The stock goes up
No
There's no BaerGrant Publishing...  No BaerGrant Publishing without Anson Baer
Where's Stewart Grant
He's probably out there sailing  enjoying his golden years wondering where the hell you are, Anson
I'm sorry
You failed
I have prepared a severance package that is more than  equitable
Valid until this evening
I could fight you on this
If I leave without your signature,  this agreement begins to disintegrate
Benefits shrink, options narrow  and your compensation will be shriveled
I think it's in your  best interest, Anson, to...  Well, I guess this is your  lucky day
My lawyers will be in touch with you
Excuse me
Has Conrad Van Orton left a message
I'll check on it right away, Mr. Van Orton
Thank you
Oh, I'm so sorry
Here
Please, don't do that
I'm so sorry
I wasn't even looking
I'm really having a bad day
How about a bad month
You did almost exactly the same thing to me when I was here last week
Here
Don't do that
Just get me some napkins and some soda water
Looks like the, uh,  cleaning bill's gonna be more than the suit
I don't think so
It was an accident, sir
Terrific
I said I was sorry
Asshole
Christine
Mr. Van Orton is a valued customer
Fine
Then you kiss his ass
Don't you talk to me like that
I apologized,  I offered to help
What do you want me to do
Clean out your locker
What
You heard me
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Van Orton
If you're not too uncomfortable,  will this table suit you for a complimentary meal
It'll be fine
I'll fetch your waiter
Thank you
Check, sir
Fucking lamb vichyssoise, you little...  Miss
Pardon me, miss
Oh, great
It's you
I don't know how this works, but do you have something for me
I, uh..
I received this note...  What're you babbling about, psycho
I need to know what is going on
You wanna know what's going on
I'm going on my second job this month
Now it looks like I'm going on unemployment
Maybe I should try to explain...  Don't explain, just fuck off
Son of a bitch
I am..
I'm trying to..
I'm apologizing
I...  Jesus, what is this
What's with him
I don't know, he just..
He fell down
Can you hear me
Do you know what to do
I don't even know if he's breathing
Here you are
Move your head
Don't stand there
Get help
Hey, hey
It's okay
We're gonna get help
How do we know he's real
He's pissed his pants, mister
Is that real enough for you
Oh, good God
He's turning blue
Police
Police
You will have to fill these forms out
I don't know this man
Here, what do you need
Can't get involved in this shit
Hey, I might have to detain you
Detain me
The report's gotta be filled out
She can do the reports
Ride with your wife
We'll meet at the hospital
The hospital
Two blocks away
She's not my wife
Let's go
This is insane
10 minutes ago, I'm about to enjoy a quiet little dinner
I received this note..
He's breathing, isn't he
Yes
Is the siren entirely necessary
Let's just talk to someone who can get this over with, shall we
Hang on
They need your driver's license number
Oh, no
You've got to be kidding
What is happening
This was what I was trying to explain to you
This is a...  A game
A what
It's a company
They plan elaborate pranks
Things like this
I don't really understand it myself
What are you talking about
This is a..
The lights, they went out
A hundred people ran away
What, so you mean the guy who just pissed himself and turned blue was..
Sorry about that
You should be
Why're they involving you
There's gotta be a...  A flashlight
Oh, great
I thought that guy was going to die
I gave him mouthtomouth
I'll see you around
How do you know that's the way
I don't
Where did you all go, you motherfucking frat boys
You'd better hide
Lobby
My brother got me this gift certificate to this company...  Why, I got the key out of this...  Out of the mouth of this  wooden clown
Never mind
I can't take this
There's no signal
What is the going rate for a trappedinelevator adventure
Well, don't even think about it
Why not
Read what the sign says
"Warning, do not attempt to open if the elevator stops
"Use emergency... "  Phone
"... phone. 
If there was one
We'll wait for help, so...  Let's just wait for help
Okay, I'll give you a boost
You get up, you go first
This is not an attempt to be gallant
If I don't lift you how are you going to get up there
I don't know, you'll pull me up
It's easier my way
Come on, step up
No
Oh, please
I'm not wearing any underwear
Okay
There I said it
Okay
We can use this like a ladder
My hero, let's go
I don't think so
Thank you
Damn it
My briefcase
I'll wait
Not as if anybody could open it
Wait a minute
This is CRS
What's CRS
This is the company I was telling you about
The one that gave me the gift certificate
This is their building
We'll wait
We'll wait for security to come  and we'll just explain
They'll love that
Explain for both of us
Wait
We don't wanna draw any attention...  Just out for a stroll
Run
We can't fit down there
Are you trying to ditch me
Hey
You're a grown man
I'm not responsible for..
I'm not the one who started running
Well I'm not the one that started this...  Get up there
I'm going
Here
Climb
So, where's your modesty around attack dogs
Hey
Shut up
Stupid fucking dogs
Let me guess
I go first
There goes a thousand dollars
Your shoes cost a thousand dollars
That one did
Here
Come on
Here you go
Okay
Watch out for nails  and rats
What
There should be a fire escape
Yeah, it's classic
Why me
Who are you
Nicholas Van Orton
What are you, a czar or something
All right
I think  if we  drop from here,  the garbage will break our fall
I think not
Be careful
What the fuck are you looking at
Oh...  Shit
Table for two, please
Where're we going
That tall bright building
It's right near there
Everything okay, miss
Yeah
How are you doing
San Francisco's finest
Is there some place I could throw this
There's a wastebasket beside the desk
Oh
Think I have a fresh sweatshirt for you somewhere
That would be great
You know, you've never even asked me my name
The maitre d' said your name was Christine
Oh, right
I guess I'll call you a cab
You got a shower in your office
Yeah
You an athlete or something
No, I'm an investment banker
I move money from one place to another
Actually, would you mind if I just quickly rinsed off
No
Is there a towel I could use
Yeah, it's behind the door
Oh, I'll just be a second
No problem
Listen, I know the owner of the City Club and I'd be happy  to give him a call if you'd like
Don't, it was a shitty job anyway
I overreacted
I, uh..
I have a confession to make
Someone gave me 400 bucks to spill drinks on you as a practical joke
Really
And what did they say
Well they said 300
I said 4
They said, "The guy in the gray flannel suit. 
I think I said, "The, uh,  "attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
Mr. Van Orton
I was afraid you weren't going to make it back
Thank you
Hello
Mr. Van Orton, it's Maria
I thought I should call
What time is it
It's 11:00
I took the liberty of rescheduling your meeting with Alison and...  No, no, no
I'll be in there in an hour
Can you..
I left my briefcase at 1010 Montgomery Street
Could you check with Lost and Found, please
Anson Baer's in town at the Ritz Carlton
Really
He's requesting dinner tonight
Well, we'll see about that
And the Hotel Nikko called to say  they have your American Express card at the front desk
You left it there last night
Should I send someone
No, just give me the number
5551111
I'll call you back
Good morning, Hotel Nikko
Yes, this is Nicholas Van Orton
I'm told you have my American Express card
Yes, Mr. Van Orton everything's in order
The concierges has arranged for the wine and flowers in the room
Has he
And a young woman phoned  to say she's on route but running a little late
Did the young woman leave her name
I'm sure I don't know
Of course you don't
Thank you
Sorry, my fault
Ah, Mr. Van Orton
Welcome back
Here we go
Have we met
I believe so
If you'll just sign here on the signature card
Thank you
My key
Huh
Don't I get a key
Didn't I give you one last night
No, I don't think so
Cute, that's very cute
This way, sir
Have a nice day
Housekeeping
Could you come back a little later
Ah
Shit
Thank you, sir
Where the fuck is he
Jesus
Why are you following me
What are you talking about
I'm not following you
I'm just driving it
Hey,  whatever I'm doing is none of your business
Is Anson Baer the game
Is that what this is all about
Look buddy, back off
Just back off, huh
What
Oh, that's cute
That's really cute
I suppose the game uses real bullets, huh
All right
I'm a private investigator
Somebody hired me to keep tabs on you
Who
Who hired you
Who hired you
Mr. Van Orton... Maria, get hold of Sutherland
Have him meet me at the Ritz Carlton
I'm on my way
What's happening
Follow me, Sam
Ah, Nicholas
It's unexpected
Now, do you really believe  that just because you publish children's books  people are gonna care about my reputation
You can have pictures of me  wearing nipple rings, buttfucking Captain Kangaroo
The only thing they care about is the stock
And whether that stock is up or down
Daddy
It's all right, dear
It's all right
And the fact that you bring Conrad into this juvenile game  is unconscionable
Are you finished
No
I'm not finished
I'd like you to meet my attorney, Samuel Sutherland
I think the two of you have got something to talk about
Oh, we met this morning
I signed the termination contract for BaerGrant
I accepted your settlement, Nicholas
You were right
I'm going sailing
You know, sailing
You're welcome to join our lunch
Maybe we can straighten this out
You remember my wife, Mary Carol, and my daughterinlaw, Kaleigh
Please  accept my  misguided, uh...  How concerned should I be
It was a misunderstanding
It looks a lot like you
Well, you should see what they do with the nightly news
What
Can I ask you to do me a favor
You know you can
Find out about a company called Consumer Recreation Services
Sounds like they make tennis rackets
What do you know
Wait a minute
They gave me a waiver
What is this
It's a...  What's..
I don't believe it
It's invisible ink
You're joking
This is what I'm dealing with
I'm being toyed with  by a bunch of depraved children
This...  Are you okay
Tell me not to worry
You don't have to worry
I promise
Okay
I'll call you later
Right
Okay, bye
Maria, the other night, last night  I got a taxi for a young woman named Christine
What's the company that we use
United
What
United Taxi Company
United Taxi Company
Call United, find out who the driver was  and where they took her
Ilsa
Oh, shit
I have a gun
You fuckers
Ilsa
Ilsa
Ilsa
Mr. Van Orton
Are you all right
What do you mean
What's happened
The house, you haven't seen the house
What's wrong
There's been a break in
Now, lock your door
Stay inside, just lock your door
Oh, be careful
911 emergency
Yes, I need the police
There's been a break in to my house
Just stay on the line and give me your address
My address is 2210 Broadway
It's the biggest house on the street
Now sir, you said it was a break in
Yes
Yes, there's been a break in
Are you sure they're gone
What
Are you sure there's not still someone somewhere in the house
Nickie
Hello, sir
Are you still there
Meet me at your car
Hello
Sir
All right
What happened
Shh
Conrad, where're we going
Just wait
What are you doing
They're methodical
If I can't trust the room service in the hotel,  I sure as hell can't trust a fucking car
Who
CRS
Who do you think
Jesus
When I think what I almost got you into...  What are you saying
Oh, I'm so fucked
They just fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you
And just when you think it's all over that's when the real fucking starts
All right, calm down
Just take a breath
They won't stop, Nick
I paid the bill
I gave them their fucking money
They won't leave me alone
What're they doing to you
Everything
I'm a goddamned human piata
Calm down
And why do they keep playing if you've already paid
I don't know
I don't know
I paid them more to make it stop
They did this
It's a flat tire
How do you know
Get a grip on yourself, will you
We'll figure it out
Okay, okay
The phone doesn't work
I can't get a signal
Really
You know how to change a tire
No, don't you
It can't be that hard
I don't think we should be out in the open like this
Hit the Teletrack
It's in the glove compartment
You're with them
What
You're doing this
You're part of it
Whose are these
I don't know about those
Somebody put them in the car
You're behind the whole thing, aren't you
What are you talking about
You brought them to me
These were in your car
They're right there in your fucking car
Conrad
Listen to what you're saying
No
You're not gonna control this conversation
Why would I ever do what you're describing
Because you resent me
Stop being emotional
It kills you that I'm living my life
Lower your voice, Conrad
What
You're afraid somebody's gonna witness the scene
Get back in your... Get back in your fucking house
Will you stop it
I'm calling the cops
You're just so afraid that somebody's gonna see  what a manipulative fucking control freak you are
What is wrong with you
What are you on
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick
I'm sorry I didn't live up to your expectations
Ah, bullshit
I'm not you
I'll never be you
I don't wanna be you
There you go again
I'm your brother
Always pushing the responsibility out on me
For Christ's sakes, I'm your brother
All I ever tried to do was help you
I don't want your help
Nobody asked you to play dad
No
You don't say that
Did I have a choice
Jackass
Conrad
What
I don't want your help
Nobody asked you to play dad
Did I have a choice
Did I have a choice
Taxi
2210 Broadway
Hey buddy, you missed the turn
Hey
Did you hear me
You missed the turn back...  No, no, no
Stop the car
Stop the car
Thank you
Open the door
Unlock the door
Open, the goddamn door
Listen
I am a very wealthy man
And whatever they're paying you  I'll double it
Oh, Jesus Christ
What
No
What, are you out of your fucking mind
It's a game
Here they are
Detective, I'm Sam Sutherland
Tim Foley
You know where we're going
It's this way
14th floor
Okay
Management for the building says this space hasn't been officially rented yet
The county recorder has no listing for a Consumer  Recreation Service or any derivation thereof
The divers, they're still looking for the cab
As soon as they find it they'll pull the plates and the VIN
Have you spoken to your brother
He hasn't called me back yet
No
What about the house
The graffiti was an oilbased marine marking solution,  illegal in the States
It's not impossible to trace but it'll take time
The photo, the gun,  the clown, the ambulance
It's all pending
Breaking and entering we've got solid
Malicious mischief, vandalism, harassment
But that's all
Illegal surveillance
Reckless endangerment
Attempted murder
Except you said you hired these guys
That's irrelevant
Now, look
It's our job to tell you what we've got
So far, we don't have motive
What was my father like, Ilsa
Why do you ask
I don't know
All the time I've known you you've never once asked about him
I guess he was just on my mind
Your mother loved your father very much
I think he just worked too hard
Was he, uh,  morose
I mean...  What I remember most  was that his manner was so  slight
You could spend time in a room  and not even know that he'd been there the whole time
No, what I mean is,  before he...  What happened
No
Nobody expected it
I wonder how much of him there is in me
Not much, I think
Was Mother worried about him
Nobody ever worried about your father
Yes
It's Maria
I found the address you wanted from United Taxi
Yeah, give it to me
It's on Potrero Hill...  Who are you
Christine, is she here
She's sleeping
Amy, who is it
Hey
What're you doing here
Can we talk
Sure
Hi
Hi
Didn't think I'd ever see you again
What can you tell me about these
Is this you
Where did you get them
My hotel room
Was in my hotel room
Are you telling me that this is not you
What makes you, um..
Think this is me
Well, the..
The bra
The red bra
Okay
Well, I thought that...  Can I sit down for a minute
Sure
Are you all right
You're not all right, are you
Is it this contest thing that you're in still or..
I'm sorry, I am being a nuisance
I should go
No, it's okay
We can talk
I'll put some clothes on
I'll be right back
Do you have an aspirin
Can I get you something to drink with this
Is this you
Oh, yeah
That's first communion
Show it to me
What's wrong
Take the picture out of the frame  and show it to me
All right
They're watching
What
Not here
They can see here
Smoke detector
What do you say, uh...  Let's go for a drive or something
We could...  No, no, no
I am tired of this
I am goddamn tired of this
We'll go for a drink
There's a...  Who do you people think you are
Who do you think you are
Come on out of there
Nicholas, please
Let's go, right now
Come on
Just, come on out of there right now
Now you've done it
So, what are they going to do
Get away from the window
What the...  What is this
Wake up, it's a fucking con
Get in, get in
You all right
Hold on
Get out of the car
I could've handed you to them
And they find me now they...  Get out of the goddamn car
You don't have a choice
No one else's gonna tell you what's going on
You wanna know
'Cause if I'm gone you never will
I can't believe they didn't even take the time to get the fucking house right
Who are they
I don't know
Nobody does
I'm an employee
Then what good are you
I know things like who you can trust  and that your brother was in it from beginning... That's a lie
Yeah
I was your waitress on your birthday
Connie told you about CRS that day
Ever seen me in there before
Sorry
I mean, it wasn't his fault
I guess he thought it was his only way out
They fleeced him real good
How did they get to him
Same thing to him they did to you
What are you talking about
Have you checked your accounts
That night in your office I got the number to your private line and modem  that gave CRS remote access to your computer
You gave them everything else
What
You took their tests, handwriting, voice samples, psych info
They used it all to figure out your passwords
And Feingold, the guy who signed you up,  he did 5 years for hacking Citibank
They only had to keep you distracted  while they broke into your financial network,  transferred your holdings into dummy accounts...  Overseas operator, please
Why else were they willing to shoot at us
Alamein Bank, Zurich, Switzerland
Because they're finished with you
Live or dead's the same
Long as you disappear
Yeah
Can I have your code, please
Yes
Bluetwobackslash0600
"D" as in David
That's right
The balance
That's impossible
They already got it, Nicholas
They got everything
You've reached the Sutherlands
Please leave a message
As you get this message, Sam, I have checked them all
I don't know how,  but they have drained my accounts
They're trying to kill me
Now you call the cops
I got one of them right here
We'll make her testify
I know how this sounds,  but you call me  on my cellular
And you be careful
They..
They cut your card in half so...  My treat
You take two sugars, right
Never mind
My name's not Christine
It's..
I mean, it's not my real name
Who fucking cares
It is just money
You should be glad you're alive
I'd rather not talk about it right now
All I mean is someone like you...  How many times have you done this
I'm curious
What
These scams
Con games, how many
Lots
But, whatever nickeldime bullshit you pulled in the past,  this is more than just me
This is pension plans,  payrolls
This is $600 million
Yes
Nick, it's Sam
I got your message
I was disturbed to say the least
So, what are we gonna do
I've been on the phone for an hour already
Nicholas, your funds are intact
Nothing's been touched
What are you talking about
I checked on them myself
Who is it
I made the calls
Nothing's changed
I'm telling you
Not one cent is unaccounted for
Who is it
My attorney says that nothing is missing
He's in on it
I don't know what the hell is happening, but stay where you are  until I get there
Sutherland's in on it
Nicholas, I have another call
Give me your precise location
Nicholas
We've got to get out of here
How did they get to him
Why did..
I wouldn't worry about it
What do you mean
It's out of your hands
Cellular calls can be intercepted
Those calls you made to B of A, France
B of A, France, Switzerland, you were talking to us
You were talking to us
Filled in the blanks
Access codes,  passwords, access codes, passwords...  Stuff even your lawyer didn't have
Stuff even your lawyer didn't have
We have it now so we're done
Bye, Nicholas
Things have happened  and it's important that... Shh, shh, shh
No money, no identification, no passport
What happened to you
Where to begin..
It's complicated
It always is
I was on holiday alone  and I was robbed by two men
Robbed
And what hotel were you staying at
I..
I don't remember
I...  Have you gone to the police
I don't speak Spanish
And I just need enough to get out of here
Oh, we'll help with the local law enforcement if you wanted to bother
As far as money is concerned, can I make a suggestion
You say you were mugged
And they didn't take that watch
How much is a watch like that worth
A couple of hundred at least
Man with a watch like that doesn't necessarily have a passport problem
Excuse me
Can I have your attention, please
Thank you
Anybody here going to San Francisco
I need a ride
I've got $18 and 70...  78 cents  for a ride to San Francisco
Anybody
Keep the change
Thanks, pal
Conrad Van Orton
Could you ring his room, please
One moment, please
Is there a problem
You're here for Conrad Van Orton
Yes
I'm the hotel manager
Pleasure to meet you
Where's my brother
Will you come with me, sir
Wait a minute, is there trouble
Sir, this is a private matter for you
There was some complaints by other guests, damage to his room
We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior
His behavior
Yes, sir
There was an incident a few days ago
A nervous breakdown, they said
The police took him
They left this address in case anyone came
It's a hospital in Napa, sir
I'm terribly sorry
Elizabeth, I need to borrow your car
Nickie,  what happened to you
I mean...  Look at you
Look at me
What happened, I..
I don't know
I..
There're just some things I have to do, all right
I need your car
Of course, you can have it if you need it
Can't I get you something to eat
You know that you're the only person  that I can trust
Everyone else is..
If Sam Sutherland calls you,  you don't tell him you talked to me
You lie to him
And whatever else happens before he speaks..
Okay, coffee,  English muffin,  and your water
This bottle  is open
Who opened this bottle
Yeah, I opened it
I don't want an opened bottle
I want an unopened bottle
I don't want ice in the glass
I want just a glass,  please
Nickie, talk to me
You're scaring me
I don't even know what you're saying
I'm sorry, Liz
I don't mean it
I'm sorry
You know, I've been thinking the last couple of days
I've had some spare time
And I wanted to tell you that  I understand why you left me
And I know that I resented it
I want to apologize to you  for shutting you out  and not being there
And I hope that you can forgive me
You're tired
You've been on the go for days
There's nothing to forgive
Then,  pain sets in
The onset of a migraine headache
If this sounds all too familiar, relief is here at last
Oh no, you bastards
Taggarene
For nearly a decade, doctors have been prescribing...  How did you find me here
Taggarene is strong medicine for headaches, toothaches, muscle fatigue, joint pains..
He's an actor
So if you trust your doctor, trust Taggarene
He's an actor on television
Can't explain now
Can I borrow your Yellow Pages
New Moon Cafe, best in Chinatown
Get out of the car, fucker
Open the door and leave it running
You're making a mistake here
Get the fuck out of the car
I am extremely fragile  right now
New Moon Cafe
He does commercials
Do you know how many customers we have
Hundreds, thousands
I know he ordered from you
He went to Montgomery Street
1010...  Is there anybody here that can help me
He's an actor
He's like one of these people you have here up on your...  Hey
Why are you taking my picture
We were hoping he could audition today
He'd really be perfect for this part
Oh, this will break his heart
Well is there any place we can contact him
Well, his beeper's here on the table
He took the kids to the zoo
The zoo
That's very, very sweet
Which zoo
Oh, it's the one with the white tiger
Lionel Fisher, I love your work
Okay, please
Look, I, uh..
I got my kids
Get rid of them
All right, guys, uh, guys
Snack time
More snacks
Here, go, go, go
That's all
Uh..
It was just a job
Nothing personal
You know
I mean, I play my part,  improvise a little
I mean, it's what I'm good at..
I need to talk to who's in charge
Nobody knows
I mean nobody gets a big picture...  Hey, Tammy, Alex cut it out
Damn it, why do they do that
Your offices are empty
I need to find out where they are
Look,  they own the whole building
They just move from floor to floor
And you work for them, right
You can get me in
No, I can't
Oh, yes, you can
You can tell them the police called
You got to speak to someone
You tell them I'm gonna blow the whistle on them
What whistle
There's no fucking whistle
This is very dangerous
I don't think that you understand
Right now  I am  extremely  dangerous
Michael, guys
Come on, we're leaving
Well we're here
Drive in
What're you gonna do, anyway
You won't get your money back
I don't care about money
I'm pulling back the curtain
I wanna meet the wizard
He's eyeing us like Tiffany Towers
Pull in somewhere where they won't see you
Shit
Stay down
Stay down
You're not allowed to be here
They called me back
I got a fitting
He's with me
You don't need me
Shut up
Get in
Oh, my God
Cuff him to the rail
What floor
You're fucked, you both
They're gonna miss me
Where
I told you they hired me over the phone...  Where did you pick up your checks
It was a different floor then
Then guess
I..
It went on this way, sort of..
I don't know
All right, take it easy
It's gonna be a surprise
Oh, fuck
What are you doing here
Back from the dead
Nicholas, you're not about to shoot anyone
Turn around
You're gonna come with me
Everybody down
Stop
All right, what do you think you're doing
You tell me
Who's behind this
Who did this to me
Why
What do you mean, "Why?
How deluded can you be
Who is responsible for this
It wasn't you
It wasn't personal
It could've been any asshole with a couple of hundred million in the bank
Get on that radio, all right
You get your boss up here
You tell them I'm gonna shoot somebody
Who am I gonna call, Nicholas
They won't do it
Oh, yes, they will
You get somebody up here  because I'm gonna kill you
They don't care about me, Nicholas
They'll let me die
You're not in a position to threaten anyone
Wait a minute
Where'd you get that
What
That gun
That's not an automatic
What the fuck are you talking about
The guard had an automatic
Where did you get the gun
This is my gun
But we searched the house
Well I guess you missed this, didn't you
There's a situation up here
We got a real goddamn gun up here...  Nicholas, it's fake
It's a part of your game
Don't you start with me now
No, no, listen to me
Don't you fucking start with me
I'm telling you the truth now
This is all the game
Bullshit, all right
Bullshit
I know what happened to that guy
They shot that guy, Feingold, Fisher, they killed him
What did you see
Think about it
What'd you see
I saw them kill him
No, what'd you really really see, this whole time
Special effects, squibs
Squibs like in the movies
Nicholas
Nicholas, listen
I've got a real gun with real goddamned bullets..
Okay, okay
I'll put it down
Feingold, Mr. Fisher
He's on the other side of that door
He's an actor
You're trying to kill me
No one's trying to kill you, Nicholas
Please put that gun down
You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life
Nicholas, there was always a safety net
The taxi, there was a diver
My house,  they shot at us with blanks
It's not true
It is
It's what you hired us for
They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne
Nicholas
Please, goddamn it
Conrad
Conrad's there
It's your birthday party
You stop lying
Let me show you
Don't you move
He's got a gun
Get back from the door
You shot him
Someone..
Someone call an ambulance
He's dead
We thought you knew
How did you let this get so out of hand
He wouldn't listen to me
We went through this over and over
The mark is your responsibility
You never,  never let the mark take over
I'm sorry
He could have almost killed us
I had a walkietalkie
I used the walkietalkie
We're going to jail
We're all going to jail for the rest of our lives
Oh, God
Nicholas
We've got him
He's in the bag
We have him here
He came in right on target
Keep everyone back until we clear away the breakaway glass
Mr. Van Orton, don't open your eyes
It's just breakaway glass, but it can still cut you
Just gonna take a look at you
I'm gonna check your pulse
Just take it easy
That was quite a fall
Happy birthday, Nickie
What is this
It's your birthday present
I had to do something
You were becoming such an asshole
Ladies and gentlemen
My brother, Nicholas Van Orton
Amazing
I just wanted to tell you
Great job
This was the best ever
Thank God you jumped
Because if you didn't,  I was supposed to throw you off
Thanks
We have to head home
We just wanted to say goodbye
Rachel
Sweet dreams
Thanks, Mel, for coming
I'm sorry about your car
I..
I think I left it at the zoo
No problem
Happy birthday, Nicholas
I'll call you
I really will
Nicholas, I haven't a clue what this is all about
Your taste in champagne is excellent as always
It was a great entrance
Yes, and I want you to know that what happened on Sunday was...  Oh, no, no, please
I've never been happier in my whole life
I thank you
And my wife thanks you
Thank you for coming
Thank you, Sam
What's this
This is  the bill
The bill
Keep the pen
Thank you, both
You wanna split it
Oh, God, yes, please
I'll take you up on that
Oh, my God
Thank you, Connie
What happened to that  waitress
What was her name, uh...  Christine
She said something about catching a plane
I just saw her out front trying to hail a cab
Christine
I, um..
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
Thank you
I...  You know, I never did ask you your name, did I
No
It's  Claire
So you catching a plane or...  Yeah, we have a gig starting next week in Australia, so...  Gonna shear some more sheep
Just a walkon this time
Well, when you get back,  maybe, you know, we could have some dinner
You don't know anything about me
No, I don't
So you tell me
Well, what... Where you're from
Originally,  Oklahoma
Colorado
I've been doing this for way too long
You know,  would you like  to have coffee with me at the airport
What kind is it
I don't know
White
<i>And the frame?</i>   Dark
Postmark
<i>Same as last time.</i>  And no note
<i>No.</i>  <i>I'm so sorry, Henrik.</i>  Will you appeal
What is this
The media event of the year
Don't try to play it down, Mikael
It won't work
Don't try to play it up
That won't work either
Mikael, can we get a quote
Mikael, will you appeal
Yes
I'll appeal to you, Viggo
<i>Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist was able to play the victim...</i>  <i>...the brave journalist going up against the bad guy.</i>  <i>I don't know why malicious intent couldn't be proven.</i>  <i> When you call a guy a criminal  If you want to say these things</i>  <i>Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity.</i>  <i>There's really no greater disgrace for a journalist than libel.</i>  <i> Was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel.</i>  Can I get that sandwich there
And a black coffee
<i>In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed...</i>  <i>Wennerstrm, founder and president of the Wennerstrm Group...</i>  <i>...used state funds intended for industrial development in Poland...</i>  <i>...in an arms deal with the rightwing Ustase in Croatia.</i>  <i>I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist

Yeah
Where have you been
Walking
Thinking
Smoking
Yeah
Just one
TV4 called
I told them no statement...  ...until we've read the judgment in its entirety
Well, I have
Anyone else
Everyone who wants to see you humiliated
Been on the phone all morning
I'm as much to blame
You are
You wrote it
I read it
I ran it
Not the same
Our credibility isn't dead yet
Mine is
I'm tired
I'm gonna go home, crawl under the duvet for a week
I'll call Greger, tell him I'm not coming home
Thank you
It's possible we could wait forever
You called her and spoke to her
I'm afraid that doesn't mean much
<i>No one here particularly likes her.</i>  I find it's much better if she works from home
But you told her I wanted to meet with her
I've told her many times I prefer her not to meet clients
<i> You like her
Very much.</i>  <i>She's one of the best investigators I have, as you saw from her report.</i>   But
I'm concerned you won't like her
She's different
In what way
In every way
<i>Miss Salander is here.</i>  Lisbeth
Mr. Dirch Frode
How do you do
Something wrong with the report
No, it was quite thorough
But I'm also interested in what's not in it
There's nothing not in it
Your opinion of him isn't
I'm not paid to give my opinion
So you don't have one
He's clean, in my opinion
You mean he's hygienic
He's who he presents himself to be
In his business, that's an asset
Well, there's less in his asset column after his conviction today
True
He made a fool of himself
If it happened that way
Are you suggesting that he was set up
That was never part of my assignment
But you're right
He did make a fool of himself professionally
How much of a fool did he make of himself financially
The judgment will just about empty his savings
May I go
Moment
Your report is light in another area
His personal life
Anything you chose not to disclose
Nothing that warranted inclusion
Does that mean yes or no
I think what Miss Salander means, and I agree, is that everyone has a right...  ...to a certain amount of privacy, even if they're being investigated
Not in this case
I need to know anything about him..
...I might find unsavory, even if she doesn't
He's had a longstanding sexual relationship...  ...with his coeditor of the magazine
It wrecked his marriage but not hers
Sometimes he performs cunnilingus
Not often enough, in my opinion
No, you're right not to include that
I know
You needed a better attorney
You needed your sister
She offered
He declined
As she hoped
Never a good idea
Mixing family and business
I would've lost anyway
It wasn't about Mikael
It was about Wennerstrm sending a message...  ...to the press and the FSA, saying, "Don't ask questions.
Cheer up
Dad
Nilla, you don't have to worry about me
Mom's worried
About me
About the money
Good evening
Nilla
What are you doing
Nothing
Are you serious
I don't wanna talk about it since I know you won't approve
Of...
Nilla
Light of Life
Light of what
Hello
Herr Blomkvist
<i> Yeah
Forgive me for intruding on Christmas.</i>  <i>My name is Dirch Frode.</i>  I'm an attorney
I represent Henrik Vanger
Perhaps you've heard of him
Yeah, of course I have
<i>He'd love to talk to you about a private matter.</i>  This is an awkward moment
<i>Oh, I'm sorry
I'm about to sit down to a Christmas dinner myself.</i>  No, that's not exactly what I meant
You're referring to your recent legal problems
That has provided us with much amusement
I'm sorry
<i>Herr Vanger has little love for Herr Wennerstrm either.</i>   Have him call me
But he would love to speak to you...  ...in person, if possible
Up north
<i> In Hedestad
That's not gonna be possible.</i>  <i>Herr Blomkvist, he's far too old to go to Stockholm
Please.</i>  Be so kind as to consider
<i>Hedestad is lovely in the winter.</i>  I'll call you back on this number
Okay
Usually when I wake up in a cold bed it's at home
I'm sorry
What are you doing
I'm writing a press release
Saying
You're taking over as publisher, you're very sorry...  ...for any nuisance Mr. Wennerstrm was caused...  ...and I can't be reached for comment
Are you giving up
Stepping aside
This makes me sick
First time in Hedestad
And the last
Oh, don't say that
It's lovely in the spring
You said it would be lovely in the winter
Well, this is unseasonable
Well, I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm
Unless we get snowed in
I'm joking  You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish
Welcome
Come inside
It's warm
How do you do
So...  ...what do you know about me
You used to run one of the largest industrial firms in the country
"Used to.
That's correct
Oh, I didn't mean that
Should I stay
No
My grandfather forged the tracks...  ...that the 4:30 train will take you home on
We stitched this country together
We made the steel, milled the lumber that built modern Sweden
And what do you think our most profitable product now is
Fertilizer
I'm not obsessed by the declining health of the company
But I am with the settling of accounts
And the clock is ticking
I need your help
I'm Doing what
Officially, assisting with my memoirs
But what you'll really be doing...  ...is solving a mystery by doing what you do so well
Your recent legal mishap notwithstanding
You will be investigating thieves, misers, bullies...  ...the most detestable collection of people that you will ever meet
My family
Would you like to sit
I could possibly clear a place if necessary
Did you make it
Have you something for me
I am on welfare, I do not administer it
This is not enough
No, thank you
<i>This is Harriet.</i>  The granddaughter of my brother Richard
Richard was a Nazi of the first order...  ...joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17
Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word "freedom"
Oh, the 4:30
Yes, I know
Okay
Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940
Missed all the real excitement
But not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife, Margareta...  ...and their son, Gottfried
Now, Gottfried, Harriet's father...  ...was what they used to call a goodtime Charlie
They still call them that
Do they
Okay
He was a charmer, a ladies' man and a drunk
In other words, a born salesman
Which he did for the company...  ...traveling around and taking clients out to dinner
Well, somebody's gotta do it
That's right
Anyway, he died in 1965
Drowned, drunk, here on the island
His wife, Isabella, who had been pretty much useless as a parent before...  ...became even more so after his death...  ...which is when I began looking after the children
Martin, who runs Vanger Industries, now that I'm retired
That's right, I Googled him
And Harriet
She was bright, curious...  ...a winning combination in any person
And beautiful
Yeah
Something happened to her
Someone in the family murdered Harriet...  ...and for the past 40 years...  ...has been trying to drive me insane
<i>It was September 24th, 1966.</i>  A Saturday
Harriet was 16
My brothers...  <i>...and their wives and their children and grandchildren...</i>  <i>...were all gathered here...</i>  <i>...for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner.</i>  <i>It was also the day the yacht club held their autumn parade.</i>  <i>Harriet, with one or two school friends, went into town to see it.</i>  She returned a little after 2:00
<i>She came into the parlor
She asked if she could talk to me.</i>  I honestly don't remember what I was doing...  ...that I thought was more important...  <i>...but I told her to give me a few minutes.</i>  It was during those few minutes that something else occurred
<i>The accident had nothing to do with Harriet...</i>  ...and yet everything
<i>It was chaos as everybody put down what they were doing.</i>  <i>Police, ambulance, fire brigade...</i>  <i>...reporters, photographers, onlookers all quickly arrived from town...</i>  <i>...just as we on the island, the family, hurried to the bridge from our side.</i>  <i>The driver of the car...</i>  ...a man named Aronsson...  <i>...was pinned and severely injured.</i>  <i>We tried desperately to pry him loose with our hands...</i>  <i>...since metal tools might spark.</i>  <i>It was an hour after the crash that Harriet was in the kitchen.</i>  Anna herself saw her
<i>Well, we finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital.</i>  <i>Just as we from our side...</i>  <i>...slowly drifted back to the house.</i>  <i>The sun was down, the excitement over.</i>  <i>We sat down to dinner.</i>  <i>It was then that I noticed...</i>  <i>...Harriet wasn't there.</i>  <i>And she wasn't there the next morning.</i>  <i>Or the next.</i>  Or the next 40 years
<i>What was she going to tell me?</i>  Why didn't I make time for her
Why didn't I listen
And she couldn't have just run away
No
Not without being seen
The firemen stayed out all night...  <i>...on the bridge pumping up gasoline.</i>  <i>No one swam across or took a boat.</i>  All the boats were still tied up on this side Sunday
Believe me, I checked
She couldn't have just fallen and drowned
No
The currents aren't strong here
Anything that falls in the water turns up
Like her father
His body didn't drift more than 10 meters...  ...when he drowned the year before
Oh, no
Someone killed her
Someone on the island that day
Someone close enough to know...  ...what she used to give me each year on my birthday
Those are from her
And the rest, from her killer
Who knows about these
There's me, the police, the killer...  ...and now you
<i>After the police investigation evaporated...</i>  <i>...I kept at it, studying all the information there was.</i>  I have spent half my life examining the events of a single day
I understand your frustration...  ...but what you're asking me to do, it's a waste of money
But we haven't discussed your fee
We don't need to
Thank you
I can't find something you've been unable to find in 40 years
You don't know that
You have a very keen investigative mind
Here's what I propose:  You come stay on the island
I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use
You study the material I send you
You find something I've missed or you don't
What you're asking me to do is set aside my life and career for  Think of this as a welldeserved holiday  A way of avoiding all those people that you might want to avoid right now
As for compensation, I'll pay you double your salary...  ...for as many months as it takes
Quadruple it if you solve the mystery
Herr Vanger  I'm not done
I will throw in one more thing...  ...even though you're a terrible negotiator
It's something you want more than anything else...  ...and it can't be bought at any price
So let me give it to you
HansErik Wennerstrm
He began his career working for me...  ...and I have followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since
You were right about him
You just couldn't prove it
We're in the middle of the worst crisis ever, and you're writing a memoir
You fired me
I need something to do
You fired you
I need you here, not the North Pole
Mikael, you know what this is going to look like
Like I've been gutted
I'm running away
I am
Wennerstrm wants to see me wave a white flag, not a red flag
If it looks like there's a problem between us, it'll satisfy him
There is a problem between us
He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down
You're leaving me to fight him alone
It's four hours by train
It's not the North Pole
Hey, he)'  <i>Network busy
Please try again later.</i>  <i>Network busy
Please try again later.</i>  What
Some milk
<i>Network busy
Please try again later.</i>  Oh, yeah
These as well
You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter
His ward
He doesn't have a daughter
Please
<i>He's had severe cerebral hemorrhaging...</i>  <i>...either from the fall itself or from a stroke that led to the fall.</i>  <i>His blood pressure is still high.</i>  <i>I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness, but that's not assured.</i>  <i>And it's possible, even if he does...</i>  <i>...that there will be neurological damage.</i>  Oh, jeez
Hi
I'm Gunnar
The caretaker
Oh, hey, Gunnar
Come in
Okay
You want to put it in there
Okay
You're an author
Well, I'm doing a biography of Herr Vanger
I saw you on television
That's unfortunate
Bit of trouble, I guess
No jail time though
That's good
No
Cost you a lot of money though, yeah
There
The entire island is owned by my family
Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald...  ...another Nazi, if you can believe
Two in the family
Oh, yes, he's quite detestable, to put it nicely
But you'll probably never see him
He's a recluse
He was there that day
Indeed, he was
His daughter, Cecilia, lives over there
They don't speak
Does anybody speak to anybody on this island
Actually, Isabella, Harriet's mother, who lives there...  ...she speaks to Harald, which is one of the reasons I don't speak to her
Right
Cecilia's brother, Birger, lives over there
Who doesn't he speak to
You, probably
But you wouldn't want him to
He can be just as unpleasant as Harald
Quickly losing track of who's who here
How you'll wish it were always so
Soon you will know us all only too well
With my apologies
Now, out there, my grandnephew Martin's house, Harriet's brother
Who speaks to him
I speak to him
He runs the company now, as I think I told you
Someone's shooting his dinner
Gunnar, probably
Oh, yes, I met him earlier
He was 19 when Harriet disappeared
Well, he lives over there
And you live there
Sorry
Your house
Oh, yes
Yes, you're right
The man who hires the detective...  ...should always be kept on the suspects list
Her mother
But what about the search
Please
Please
I beg you
<i>The fact that I never found a body was not surprising.</i>  <i>You can't dig up an entire island.</i>  But neither could I find the motive
Was it spontaneous
Was it calculated
Did she know something someone wished she didn't
Was it about business
Business
Well, she was 16
And very bright
Henrik told me and many others he could easily see her...  ...running the company one day
She was with some friends that day at a parade
She told them she was feeling unwell
She left early
But they also told me she kept secrets from them too
The main thing I learned was that teenage girls are complicated
I have one
Then you know
I wanted to...  ...ask you about this
She received that from Henrik the Christmas before
I've studied it more times than I can say
I know every page of it
It's the last page I was curious about
As was I
It's a list of names, numbers and it must have some significance
All local phone numbers
The first belonged to a woman, Margot...  ...whose mother was Magda, who denied knowing Harriet
The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosmarie Larsson...  ...an elderly woman who died some years before
The other three were not connected in any way that I could find
I reminded you of things you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry
I can't forget
It's my Rebecka case
I don't know what that is
Every policeman has at least one unsolved case to obsess over
Back then we had an Officer Torstensson
Year after year, he kept going back to this Rebecka case
Taking out the files, studying them over and over
We were young
We laughed at him
And that was also a missinggirl case
No, no, no, that's not why I mention it
I'm talking about the soul of a policeman
<i>Poor old Torstensson never solved it.</i>  <i>And he never let it go.</i>  So how's Mr. Palmgren doing
I heard he had a stroke of some kind
It's terrible
Now, what exactly do you do at this security company
Make coffee, sort mail
But not fulltime
Not even parttime consistently
They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August
How much do you make there
Enough
How much is your rent
I Pay my rent
And when was the last time you were late
Never
You think that thing through your eyebrow makes you attractive
Here's the problem
There's a discrepancy between the obligation...  ...of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances
There's no discrepancy
It was clear I could manage my own finances
That is not clear to me
I'm not a child
You are not
But you were
And between then and now, you were committed...  ...to the locked ward of St. Stefan's where you continued...  ...to display violent aggression
And you failed to adapt to four foster homes...  ...were arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics...  ...again for assault, smashing a bottle into a man's face
And it's not even that long ago
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking that you have changed...  ...but when I'm looking at this...  ...not to mention the way you're looking at me now..
...I don't think you have
So the good old Mr. Palmgren days are over
Starting now, you will be given a monthly allowance
You'll provide me with receipts for your expenses
If the numbers don't balance, I assume the difference is going to drugs
I've taken care of myself since I was 10
The state has taken care of you
Miss Salander, please, look at me, this is important
Since your behavior is elaborately documented in here...  ...it will shock no one if I chose an alternative...  ...to the very lenient arrangement I have just outlined
Would you prefer institutionalization
Mikael
Yes
I'm Liv
Oh, hi
We're going to the same place
Hop in
Oh, good, thank you
I found him at death's door, halfway up the hill
I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape
It's a climb for anyone
I should've warned you
Come in
Thank you, Martin
Henrik says great things about you
No, no
Leave your shoes on
Martin
Smells wonderful
What are we drinking
What a place
Look at that view
I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Gteborg
When it was sold, I went with it
A dark day
I live in Hong Kong, but come back to Stockholm for family events
And I drive up to spend a couple of days with Martin
It's just the moose steak she wants
Who can blame her
It's wonderful
Something's left open
Do you like this wine...  ...or you want to try something else
No, no, it's fine
You're writing a book now, Martin said
Henrik's biography
I love Henrik
He's fascinating
Martin too
Together they are the old Sweden and the new
Yes, they are
You know about Harriet, right
You don't
Yes, I do
The family doesn't want to talk about it, but it can't be swept under the rug
What can't
Harriet
We can talk about it later
We can talk about it now
Liv knows everything about my crazy family
That's why she'll never marry me
That's one reason
I don't want to read about that in the book
Everything else is fine
Harriet certainly
You know, everything changed after that
Not just the family but the company as well
How so
We're not Ericsson or Nordea
But we're still the largest familyowned company in the country
At our height we had 40,000 employees
We have half of that now
And that downward slide began after my sister's death
It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit...  ...and his heart
You were here that day
I came in later...  ...after the accident on the bridge, with the 4:30 train
I know it well
A terrible day
And the days after, you know
Searching, not finding
Even worse
This event, Mikael, it has to have a big part in your book
I got a call from social welfare
I've been assigned a new guardian
Hi
Hello
I thought I'd come over and say hello
I'm Cecilia
Oh, yes
Please, come in
Can I get you some coffee
No, thank you
We are all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family
It's not about the family
It's about Henrik and the company
Like I said
It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone
Unlike the one that landed you in court
Unlike that one, yes
So you're not really here to find out what happened to Harriet
I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but, no, that's by no means my focus
Those boxes that Gunnar carted down here...  ...which are where, in the closet now
Those weren't Henrik's investigation
I wonder sometimes who's crazier, my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle
Since we're talking about her...  ...since you brought her up, what was she like
What was Harriet like
I'm sure Henrik has told you
He was my age back then
He couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager
You were the same age
My sister Anita was closer to her in age
She knew Harriet better than anyone
You should talk to her
I'd love to
Where is she
If I had to guess, London
You don't know where your sister lives
I haven't seen her in years
We never really got along
I'm getting used to that comment
She hates this place more than I do
She left
Moved to London, that was it
You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit
I'll track her down for you
If you do, and try talking to her about us...  ...don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck oh'
You're backed up, aren't you
Hard drive at home, yeah
Okay
That's good, because this one's done
<i>Have you ever had any sexually transmitted diseases?</i>  <i>And when was the last time that you were tested for HIV?</i>  <i>How many partners have you had in the last month?</i>  And how many of those were men
It's regulation, I have to ask these things
It's a health matter
Write what you want
And why do you need such an expensive computer
For work
Making coffee, sorting mail
I should have control of my money
And you will
Once you learn to be sociable, get along with people
Can you do that
Why don't we start with that now, huh
Why don't we start with me
You do something for me, I do something for you
That's what normal people do
I want you to have that computer
Feel that
That's gabardine
Unzip it
And...  And..
I like the reticence
It's almost convincing
<i>Anita Vanger.</i>   Through there
Thank you
Excuse me
I probably should have made an appointment
No, it's fine
Please have a seat
Thank you
Mikael
Mikael
How do you do
How do you do
So you're looking for investment counseling
Well, I would be if I had any money
I'm sorry, I don't understand
I'm writing a biography of your Uncle Henrik
That's why I'm here
I haven't seen him in over 20 years
Actually it's a lot more than that
Haven't seen my sister, haven't seen anyone in that family
Most of what I'm writing about predates that...  ...so your recollections are valid
I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question
Well, then let me narrow it down
I've gotten up to the 1960s...  ...to the event that, you know, changed everything in Henrik's life
Harriet
Everything that I know about that I told to whatever his name was
Morell
My recollections were a lot better then
I'm not really speaking about the event itself
I just want to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like
She was very messed up
Well, just like all us Vanger kids, really, but...  Crazy mother
Drunken father
At least her father wasn't a Nazi
Was he abusive
Mine
No, hers
Not that I ever saw, but you could tell that something was going on
Some days she'd be very withdrawn
And then the next minute she'd be putting on makeup...  ...and wearing the tightest sweater that she had to school
And then she'd be studying her Bible like a nun
No Vanger was ever religious
Can you imagine
She was obviously very unhappy
What do you think happened to her
Everyone knows what
You don't have any thoughts about who or why
All that I know is that I felt really sorry for her
I got away when I was 18 and I never went back
And she'd have done the same
But she never made it to 18
<i>Mr
Bjurman, please
It's Lisbeth Salander.</i>  <i>Hold for a moment, please.</i>  <i>Lisbeth, I haven't seen you Are you well?</i>  I'm fine
I'm sorry I missed our appointment, I had a lot of work
<i>Something the matter?</i>  No, no, nothing to be concerned about
Actually, I need another advance on my allowance
Can I come to your office tonight
<i>I don't work at night, Lisbeth.</i>  <i>Why don't you come to my house, huh
Do you have a pen?</i>  I don't need a pen
What's the address
<i>It's...</i>  <i> Hello
It's me.</i>  Lisbeth
Come on in
You like it
It's nice
It's home
What do you need money for this time
Food
How are you
I'm so glad you decided to come and visit
I just want my money
Well, let's see if we can help you out with that
Wait
Is there a problem
I just want to know...  ...am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat
You're so cute when you're surly
I forgot to ask you:  You like anal sex
<i>Faith is the assurance of things hoped for...</i>  <i>...the evidence of things not seen
Through faith we understand...</i>  <i>...that the world was created by the word of God.</i>   I'll drive you home
I can get home on my own
Are you sure
Is it any warmer inside
No
I apologize if you've been having financial problems...  ...at the magazine during Mikael's absence
We'll work through them
Are you sure
How long do you think you can hang on
Six months
That sounds about right
I used to be in the newspaper business
We owned six dailies back in the '50s
We still own one
<i> The Courier, here in town
Which I let my nephew, Birger, run...</i>  ...because he can't run anything else
So, what would you say to taking on a partner
Well, we've never had to consider it before
We value our independence very much
Independence in publishing is dependent on advertisers
However much you have, you retain
We don't care about content
Excuse me
Did I miss something
Talking about investing in the magazine
I gathered that
But why
Not out of greed, that's for sure
I feel badly that I've taken Mikael away from you at the worst possible time
But now I am convinced that this is the right thing to do
The moral thing
That's one reason
And...  And...
The enemies of my friends are my enemies
How long have you been discussing this with them
I haven't
They called yesterday and asked me to come up
Why didn't you tell me
You live in the woods
I deserve to be treated like an idiot
I wanted to hear what they had to say
You would've said no before they could
Well, I'm saying it now
It's a bad idea
You heard me tell them we had six months
I lied
We will be out of business in three
But you don't know this family like I do
They're crazy
We're not marrying into it
If we do this, that's exactly what we're doing
So you wanna say no, let's say no
Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing
Mikael
What
I'm leaving this godforsaken island in the morning
So
So are you coming to bed or not
How much do one of those cost
Around 3000
This is really gonna hurt
Your call
<i>Vanger Industries took a controlling interest in Millennium magazine...</i>  <i>...which, according to analysts, has been in financial trouble...</i>  <i>Millennium is an excellent magazine We think it's undervalued right now.</i>  <i>Which is good business for us.</i>  Well, there's another reason
I don't like bullies
Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrm
I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue his enemies into submission
<i>If Herr Wennerstrm would like to try it again...</i>  <i>...he will find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back.</i>  <i>I've always admired Henrik Vanger
He's a titan and a gentleman.</i>  <i>But he's also quite old now...</i>  <i>...which may explain how he could be taken in by a convicted liar.</i>  Threetwenty
Shit
<i>The current archive is on CDs.</i>  <i>The older stuff, still negatives.</i>  What general period are you interested in
September, 1966
Thank you
Is this about Harriet Vanger
You're too young to know about that
Everyone here grows up knowing about her
It's how we're taught about strangers
Lisbeth
I need to pay my rent
I need some money
Oh, come on in
I feel a bit badly how we left it last time
Me too
Good
You're alive
You recognize this
I had it with me last time
I set it here, remember
And this snap, you see it
It's not a snap
It's a wideangle fiberoptics lens
I thought it was going to be another blow job...  ...which is disgusting enough
But I misjudged just how sick you are
Okay
Here's what's going to happen
Pay attention
Look at me
Once you can sit again...  ...which could be a while, I admit, we're going to go to my bank...  ...and tell them that I alone have access to my money
Nod
After that you will never contact me again
Each month you will prepare a report of a meeting we will never have
In it, you'll describe how well I'm doing
How "sociable" I'm becoming
Then you will negotiate with the court...  ...to have my declaration of incompetence lifted
If you fail, this video will spread across the internet like a virus
Nod
And if anything should happen to me, if I get run over by a car...  ...if you run me over with a car, this will upload automatically
Nod that you understand
Gabardine
I'm taking the keys to this apartment because I'll be checking on you
If I find a girl in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not...  No, not the video
I'll kill you
Do you doubt anything I've said
Do you doubt what's in the reports that have followed me around all my life
What do they say
If you had to sum it up
They say I'm insane
No, it's okay, you can nod because it's true
I am insane
Nod
I know it's going to be hard for you to abide by my rules
The abstinence part most of all
So I'm going to make it easier for you
Lie still
I've never done this before
And there will be blood
Hi
Hi
What are you doing here
On my way to Skelleftea
I can only stay a couple of hours
What's in Skelleftea
Bible camp
Oh, yeah
I'm not dangerous
It's fine, Nilla
Whatever you want to do is fine
Everybody needs something
Just as long as it's not God
I didn't say that
I haven't been around enough to really know what's going on with you
And I apologize for that
But I'd never want you not to tell me something...  ...because you think I might not want to hear it
That's what I'm doing
<i>It should've been me visiting you.</i>   I'm sorry
It's okay
It was nice seeing you
Byebye   I'll see you
Yeah
Thanks
Oh, don't go too hard on the Catholics
The what
The article you're writing
Oh, I'm not writing an article about Catholics
The Bible quotes by your desk
<i>I love you.</i>  <i>A woman who is a medium or a sorcerer...</i>  <i>...shall be put to death by stoning.</i>  <i>If a dove is the sinner's offering...</i>  <i>...the priest shall wring off its head, cleave its wings...</i>  <i>...and burn it upon the altar.</i>   Hello
Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist
<i>Yes, hello
How are you?</i>  <i>Not still freezing in Hedestad, I hope, for your sake.</i>  You know that Rebecka case you mentioned
<i>Would you recall her last name?</i>  Of course I do
But what has that to do with anything
<i> Nothing, probably
Jacobsson
Rebecka Jacobsson.</i>  <i>And how was she killed?</i>  She was decapitated
<i>Her arms were cutoff and she was burned.</i>  <i>But all that happened in the 1940s.</i>  <i> What have you found
I have to call you back.</i>  <i>Why?</i>   Is it Henrik
We were talking
He rubbed his arm, then he collapsed
Think he's gonna be okay
I honestly don't know
You go
Talk to you later
I'm sorry
Evening
So how is he
Well, the good news is he survived
How he does now, we'll have to see
He's in intensive care
Right
May I have one of those
You want a sandwich
Small Scotch
Sure
Thank you
I hate to be indelicate, but Henrik promised me something...  ...when I agreed to do this
Wennerstrm
I need to know what he has on him
Now
In case..
In case he dies
Well, that is indelicate
And I apologize
I don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me
And he can't tell you in the condition he's in, so...  We also didn't discuss who I'd report to if something should happen to him
Oh, well, you'd report to me, of course
But we both know that nothing's going to come of this, don't we
No
No, we don't know that
What do you mean
I may have found something
You're joking
What have you found
The last time I reported on something without being absolutely sure..
...I lost my life savings
I need a research assistant
Can you authorize that
Yes
Do you have one in mind
I can find someone
I know an excellent one
She did the background check on you
The what
Well, you don't think we can hire just anyone...  ...without doing a background check
I want to read that
Herr Frode was kind enough to share your report with me
The investigator's name
That is her name, yes
See, I can't find any record of her, and I'm pretty good at that
Would it matter what her name is
If I wanted to speak to her, yes
It's against policy
You sure
Just like your sources
You understand
Okay
Here's a name for you
My sister
She's also my lawyer
She'll be contacting you
There are things in here that can only have come from one place
The reason you can find no record of her is because her records are sealed
She's a ward of the state
What's that gotta do with anything
She's had a rough life
Can we please not make it any rougher
Who is it
It's Mikael Blomkvist
Actually, I'm not really up yet
May I come in
Please
Hi
You and I need to talk
I've got us some breakf  I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had some company
Who do you think you are
I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do
Why don't you put some clothes on, get rid of your girlfriend
We need to talk
I'm sorry, you have to go
Okay
Do you need me to stay
No
Bye
Bye
Bye
Sorry
It's okay
I guess I must have alarmed you, turning up like that
If you touch me, I'll more than alarm you
That won't be necessary
Your report, very detailed
But for me, it wasn't very entertaining
It wasn't meant to be
When I write about people, I try to entertain the reader
Wennerstrm wasn't entertained much
Your boss, Armansky...  ...yeah, he tells me you only do jobs that interest you...  ...so I suppose I should be flattered
You gonna sit down
He also says that you're the one he goes to when the job is sensitive
That's the word he used, "sensitive.
I'm gonna use "illegal"...  ...because that's what it was when you hacked into my computer
No, I'm not gonna do anything about that
I could, but I won't
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tell you a story...  ...and if it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research further
And if not, I'll do the washing up and you'll never see me again
Here, you should eat that
What kind of research
Lisbeth Oh, can I call you Lisbeth
I want you to help me catch a killer of women
<i>I've got R.J.</i>  Rebecka Jacobsson
I've got absolutely no idea...  ...who the rest of these are or how they're connected...  ...to the death of a 16yearold girl, but they must be somehow
What we've gotta do is find out who they are, what happened to them...  ...and what these Leviticus verses have to do with anything
What are you doing
Getting started
You can keep talking if you want
Don't you need to look over these
I got it
Cat
How'd you get in
No one has asked me about Magda in over 40 years
Why would a lady like you want to know about an awful murder
It interests me
Does it
<i>Her husband was the first suspect.</i>  <i>The husband is always the first suspect and usually the last.</i>  But not this time
We moved on to a neighbor
Then a vagrant
Once you get to strangers, it's only a matter of time...  ...before you get to gypsies and you know you're never going to solve it
How exactly was she killed
Miss...
Salander
Miss Salander
I hope you don't mind me asking, but when did you last eat
I have a high metabolism
I can't put on weight
I'm asking because it is better to look at what I am about to show you...  ...on an empty stomach
<i>If a man's offering is a lamb, it shall be a female without blemish.</i>  <i>He should lay his hand upon its head...</i>  <i>...slaughter it, empty its blood on the base of the altar...</i>  <i>...and he shall be forgiven.</i>   How is he
He needs surgery...  ...but there's no DNR in place
So it's up to the family to decide...  ...should the occasion arise, whether to resuscitate or not
And they're not good at decisions
So how was it with Miss Salander
She said yes
Do you think I might be able to see him
He was asleep the last time I looked, but let me check
Thank you
Don't check
Tell him to pack his things and leave
Mother, please
Don't use that tone with me
Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik
We should put this to a vote
Don't be an idiot, Birger
We all know what Henrik wants
Can we just do that
Henrik is fighting for his life in there
This is the last thing he needs
Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger, there is no smoking in here
Go back to Stockholm
When we need a family chronicle written by a libelist...  ...we know who to call
All right
Thanks
This way, miss
<i>If a woman approaches any beast...</i>  <i>...and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast.</i>  <i>Their blood shall be upon them.</i>  <i>My family's impossible.</i>  That's why the company's such a mess
I apologize for my mother's behavior
I'm used to it
It has nothing to do with you
It's between her and Henrik
She lost it when my father died, and her drinking and her...  Got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her...  ...and left her excommunicated in the old house...  ...on the other side of the island
She hasn't forgiven him
You must stay
You're the last chance Henrik has at some kind of resolution
Put this to rest one way or another
I'll keep my mother away
But please, hurry
Of course
Lisbeth
I'll get that
It's okay
Martin Vanger
How do you do
Fine
It's a girlfriend, or...
Assistant
Thank you so much
Good night
Good night
Problems finding the place
Everyone in town knows who and where you are
That's comforting
Are you hungry
I can make you a sandwich
No
I used to have a motorbike, a Triumph
I know
The five cases from Harriet's list
And five more she missed
Three I'm sure of
Rebecka was the first, just as you thought
The second, M.H., is Mari Holmberg, a prostitute in Kalmar...  ...murdered in 1954, matching Leviticus 20:18
Right
"if a man lies with a woman having her sickness...  ...he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered...  ...the fountain of her blood.
Raped and stabbed, but cause of death was suffocation by sanitary napkin
Okay
R.L
Rakel Lunde, 1957
A cleaning woman and parttime palm reader
Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped
Head crushed with a rock
Leviticus 20:27
"A woman who is a medium or sorceress...  ...shall be put to death by stoning.
I usually like to smoke outside
Sara Witt, 1964
Daughter of a pastor
Tied to her bed
Raped
Charred in the fire that burned down her house
Leviticus 21:9
"The daughter of a priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot...  ...profanes her father and shall be burned with fire.
Magda Lovisa Sjberg, 1960
Found in a barn
Stabbed and raped with farm tools
The cow in the next stall had its throat slit
Its blood was splashed on her and hers on it
Leviticus 20:16
"If a woman lies with any beast...  ...you shall kill the woman and the beast
Their blood is upon them.
Lea Persson, 1962
Found by her sister in their pet shop
Raped, beaten
The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums
There was a parakeet inside her
Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960
A runaway
Raped, strangled
A burnt pigeon tied around her neck
Lena Andersson, 1967
A student
Raped, stabbed, decapitated   Okay
I'm not finished
We're looking for a serial murderer...  ...but what could that have to do with a teenager living on an island
She was looking for him too
<i>Rape
Torture
Fire.</i>  Animals
Religion
Am I missing anything
The names
They're all Biblical
The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary
Rebecka, Sara, all from the Old Testament
Which means they're all Jewish
One thing the Vangers have more than their fair share of, it's antiSemites
There's one right there
I can sleep on a couch
Okay
Right
Oh, yeah, there might be a cat somewhere
Good night
Night
Harriet's name isn't
Isn't what
Jewish
No
What are you doing
Reading your notes
They're encrypted
Please
Have some coffee
Okay
Then we're gonna have a very serious conversation...  ...about what's yours and what's mine
It's amazing what you figured out with the parade photos
Thank you
It's too bad you don't have hers
Whose
Her
Can I
Sorry
Yeah, all right
Close that
No
Not that
That's the one
Yep
Where the fuck's that
That's down there, isn't it
Okay
Oh, yeah, yeah
And...  What does that say there
"N" something "RSJ.
That's "Norsj," yeah
Then something Something "RIF.
"Carpentry.
Well, we need to find a carpenter
Fuck
The carpentry shop is gone
I don't even know if he worked there or not...  ...but if he did, maybe he used to come in here for hardware
I don't recognize him
Sorry
Well, I had to start somewhere
I'm no detective, but 1966, I would have started at a retirement home
This is Brannlund's kid
Do you know where I might find him
The son
Next to his father at the cemetery
He was killed in an accident on a construction site, years ago
But...  ...she might still be alive
His widow
Do you know where I might find her
<i>Please drive to highlighted route.</i>  In 1966, you were in Hedestad with your husband
Who took these
A local photographer
You were taking pictures too that day...  ...and I'd love to look at them if by some miracle you have them
It wouldn't be a miracle
We were on our honeymoon
But Why
This girl here
Here, you can see her better in the enlargement
See, that's you there
Just after this was taken...  ...after she'd seen something across the street, she was murdered
How awful
There you are
Thank you
Would you mind if I made a copy of this
No
I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky
So call him
Next time, fill out the proper paperwork
Which one are you
Going down
How's your sex life
I didn't care much for your last report
It felt perfunctory, like your heart wasn't in it
Let's see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next month's
Don't speak
I don't want to hear your voice, just nod
Start looking for a shrink you can bribe...  ...to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me
And stop visiting tattooremoval websites
Or I'll do it again...  ...right here
Is that dental floss
Yes
You're gonna sterilize that, right
Couldn't we just use tape or something
No
What
Thank you
Jesus
Drink
Okay
Just be careful
It's my eye
Don't move
You're not a doctor
Take off your wet clothes
What
Yeah
Thank you
Yeah, I think it's stopped bleeding
It still fucking hurts, though
Madness
I mean, madness
This is fucking madness
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay
Jesus, that hurts
Fuck
This is insane
I mean, these people  Somebody was shooting at me
I mean, it wasn't an accident
No one's shooting at you now
You know, I'm pretty sure this is a bad idea
Why
I'm old and we work together  You work with what'shername and that's worked out for you
Yeah, well, I do have some standards, believe it or not
You need to stop talking
Oh, shit
Do you want me to open a window
I like working with you
I like working with you too
It could have been a stray shot
Not by Gunnar
If he wanted to shoot him, he wouldn't be here
And then we have poachers
They shoot at anything that moves
Or he's right, Dirch
What if he is
This has to stop
Do you want to stop, Mikael
Look, I have police reports, photos...  ...Henrik's notes, my notes, Lisbeth's research
What I don't have is Vanger Industries' records
That's what I want
Why
Will you authorize it
What, the private corporate records
Well, how far back
Henrik said I could have access to everything
This is what I need
That's not what he meant
I'll sign a nondisclosure statement
Just a minute
I think Henrik would say yes
That's why he has me
To protect him from himself
It's insane
What have we got to hide
After 120 years of business, probably a lot
If this is what he needs to finish, he should have permission
What am I looking for
Any connections between Vanger Industries...  ...and the towns where the women were killed
And everything about Frode
Your father was taking pictures that day that no one has seen
I'd like to take a look at them
So ask him
I was wondering if you could do that
I don't speak to him
Could you make an exception in my case
Are you afraid to be in the same room with him
I'm not saying you shouldn't be
So you won't help me
Sorry
Please
Are you finished
I need to know where all factories...  ...offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966
You already have everything
No, I don't
Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships or suppliers
You'll have to do without
Mr. Frode said I have access...  ...to whatever I need
I need this  You have access to this floor
Call him
Thank you for seeing me
Come in
Tea
Please
Sven Olov Lindholm
Me
Handsome
Birger Furugard
Me
Per Engdahl
But your interest is in my more candid photographic work
Friends, relations, that kind of thing
Please
"Blom" or "Bloom"
Blomkvist
I'm not a recluse
I don't close my door to anybody
Thank you
They just don't visit
Well...  ...perhaps if you redecorated
Hide the past like they do
Under a thin, shiny veneer
Like an IKEA table
I am the most honest of all of them
The family
Sweden
Landscape
Some nice landscapes there
Who is this
The blurry one
I can't tell
Oh, that's Gottfried's boy
That's Martin
Yeah
Handsome but useless young man
Like his father
Like his father
We're closing
Nowhere near finished
I'm not authorized to stay late
I am
And I need access to everything, including anything that's locked
Call Frode
Leave the keys with the guard
Come on
Shit
Martin
Mikael
Hi there
Your evening stroll
Yes, that's right, I...   How are you
Good
I stopped by the hospital on my way home
Henrik asked me to ask you something
What was that
Come on in
I'll make you a drink
Hello, Martin
Shut the door
It's quite windy
What happened to you
When
Just now
I fell in the dark
You don't have a flashlight
I'll get you one
I just wasn't being careful, that's all
How's the investigation going
Nothing new to report
No
Dirch says the girl is really clever
Maybe she'll turn something up
Maybe
Thank you for that
So, what did he say
What
You said Henrik asked you to ask me something
Well, I just did
What
How's the investigation
Oh, yeah
That was his question
Do you hunt
We should go hunting together sometime
Sure
Nothing at all new to report
No
Nothing
I can see you're anxious
No
No, I mean to get home after the walk
Yeah, well, I suppose I am
To have dinner with your girlfriend
Assistant
We'll have better luck with a gun
I'm sorry
When we go hunting
A gun
Rather than a knife
I want to show you something
Bring your drink
Leave my knife
To the right
<i>Hi, leave a message
I'll call</i>  You know what's harder than shooting someone
Just missing him
That was a very good shot up at the cabin
It didn't work
I'm here
Mikael, it did work
You're here
Inside
You spilled your drink
Why didn't you just go home
May I
How did you do it
What did you find
We can talk or we can just get on with it
I found a photograph...  ...no one has seen
Of
You
In an Uppsala prep school blazer
What does that prove
You lied about where you were that day
Did I
Or rather, when
So what
People lie all the time
It also says that you and Lena Andersson were schoolmates
Lena  That was a long time ago
Where's this photo now
Is it with all the other crap on your desk
There's a copy on my laptop
There's another copy...  ...on a secure website
Secure website
That's a lie
How much does the girl know
I hope it's as much as you do
That'll make it fun
Where is she
Stockholm
She went this morning
That's a lie
She's at our offices looking at more old crap
I got a call from our archives manager
She was very perturbed with this girl Lisbeth
I like that name
Lisbeth
So when Lisbeth leaves, I will get a call from security...  ...so I can be at your cottage to greet her
I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me
Hey, he)'  So, what do you wanna know
You're a journalist, ask me questions
What do I do with the girls
That's a good question
Well, before, I do what we're doing:  Sit down, relax, have a drink
I like that part a lot
Having a chat when both of you know that one of you is going to die
And afterwards, I just get rid of them, far out at sea
Unlike my father, who left them scattered...  ...all over the place, like trophies
That's not very smart, if you ask me
Well, he was a loud and garish man
Frankly, he got what he deserved
You can't be a sloppy technician like that
You can't drink to excess like he did
This takes discipline
It's a science of a thousand details
The planning, the execution
It's the cleanup
I guess I don't have to tell you...  ...but you're going to create quite a mess here
Let me ask you something
Why don't people trust their instincts
They sense something is wrong...  ...someone is walking too close behind them
You knew something was wrong
But you came back into the house
Did I force you
Did I drag you in
No
All I had to do was offer you a drink
It's hard to believe that the fear of offending...  ...can be stronger than the fear of pain, but you know what
It is
And they always come willingly
And then they sit there
They know it's all over, just like you do
But somehow, they still think they have a chance
"Maybe if I say the right thing
Maybe if I'm polite
If I cry, if I beg.
And when I see the hope draining from their face...  ...like it is from yours right now..
...I can feel myself...  ...getting hard
But, you know, we're not that different, you and I
We both have urges
Satisfying mine...  ...requires more towels
It might amuse you to know...  ...that while you were upstairs having moose with me and Liv...  ...who, by the way, finds me very conventional..
...I had Irina down here in that cage
Who is Irina, you might ask
Just another girl
Just another immigrant whore
Who misses them
Your sister wasn't
What
Your sister Harriet wasn't just another girl
You found her
What happened to her
You killed her
You useless fucking detective
This too tight to talk
Good
I'm tired of talking to you
I've never had a man in here before
In fact, I've never touched a man...  ...except my father
That was our duty
Harriet's and mine
Hey
There's a gun
There's a gun on the television
May I kill him
Yeah
How come a 23yearold...  ...is a ward of the state
I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life
Since when have they said that
Since I was 12
What happened when you were 12
I'm sorry, that's none of my business
I tried to kill my father
Burned him alive
Got about 80 percent of him
I made some coffee
Who's that
It's Harriet
I found it in Martin's basement among his souvenirs
No, Martin didn't deny killing anyone
But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused
He got angry at me because I couldn't tell him what had happened to her
He didn't kill her
His father didn't do it
He was dead the year before
What if she did somehow manage to get away
I mean, if...  ...she is still alive...  ...then there's only one person in this family who'd know where she is
Fuck me
Fuck me
Fuck me
Your turn
Right
Here
Hi
Look, I'm sorry to bother you
What do you want
Has no one called you
About
Your cousin Martin
What about him
He died in a car accident...  ...last Thursday
There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad
I'm not interested in any memorial
Well, I understand
What do you understand
Well, that you don't care very much for your family
Look, I just thought you should know
Now I know
How'd it go
Okay, I think
She's on
And she's shopping
She's still playing solitaire
And she hasn't called anyone
No
We have her cell phone too
I was so sure she was gonna lead us to her
Put your hand back in my shirt
There's only one reason she hasn't called Harriet
She can't
Because Harriet is dead
I was just thinking that   Just one second
Okay
What were you going to say
I was just thinking, there could be one other possibility
Well, we could, absolutely
What is it now
Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook...  ...Harriet
So you sent the flowers
Yes, I did
We found in the Swedish Family Registry that Anita was married
But the family never knew, did they
No
So I'm guessing she then came here on her marriedname passport...  ...and you followed on her maidenname passport
No, actually, it was the other way around
She thought that it was safer if I traveled with Spencer myself
Well, what did he think about that
Nothing
Only that he loved her
She said, "if you love me, you'll do this and not ask why.
And he never did
And they both died 20 years ago
Car accident
You found that out too
Is that you
I was 14 the first time he raped me
Martin
No, my father
Martin only started after he had died
Well, why didn't you tell somebody
I did
My mother
Henrik would've done something
I almost told him
But I was afraid because of what I'd done
I...  You still don't understand, do you
A year after the first time...  ...and there were many times during that year...  ...my father got drunker than usual one night...  ...and he started bragging about the women he'd killed
He quoted from the Bible as he tore my clothes off
<i>He tied a belt around my neck.</i>  He wanted to kill me
I got out of the house
<i>I went down to the dock.</i>  He came staggering after me
I could never fight him off in a small space...  <i>...but out in the open...</i>  ...I was strong enough to deal with an old drunk
When it was over..
<i>...I looked up and Martin was standing there, staring at me.</i>  And all I'd accomplished was substitute one for another
<i>A couple of months later, Henrik sent Martin to school in Uppsala.</i>  And I thought that maybe, just maybe, the nightmare was finally over
<i>And then I saw him the day of the parade...</i>  <i>...across the street.</i>  <i>And I knew that it would never be over.</i>  So how did you escape
Anita
She...  She insisted that I leave everything behind
If I took anything the police might have suspected that I was still alive
<i>As everyone ate dinner, I was no more than 20 meters away from them.</i>  <i>I spent the night there
That's when the search started.</i>  <i>In the morning, she came to get me.</i>  <i>I'd grown up with that bridge as my link to home...</i>  <i>...but all I could think is...</i>  ...if I could just get away from them...  <i>...just get past the police...</i>  <i>...then I might be safe.</i>  <i>And I was.</i>  Until you showed up
You're safe now
How did you get away
Someone saved me too   How are you feeling
I'm fine
Thank you, Anna
I made you a promise...  ...whether you found anything or not
So, what do you have to tell me
What's this
Hello, Henrik
I barely remember Wennerstrm working here, much less being fired  How could you
It was such a long time ago...  ...which is kind of more to the point than the money he embezzled from you
You're referring to the statute of limitations...  ...but I had no idea this is what Henrik was holding out
If I had, I never would've let him bring you up here
He wasn't trying to deceive you
He knows you can't try somebody 35 years after the event
I like Henrik, but he knows that
A man's reputation means something
He believes that
He thought you could destroy Wennerstrm...  ...in the court of public opinion
The court of public opinion...  ...celebrates people's bad behavior
He's an elderly man
He promised me Wennerstrm's carcass on a plate
This isn't even the plate
I can't do anything with this
Yes, of course
What happened with Wennerstrm
How did he get you
I was stupid
I heard something
I got it from an anonymous source...  ...who I'm now sure was one of Wennerstrm's lackeys
It was fake
Which he easily proved in court
You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life...  ...was illegal and immoral
Would you feel the same about Wennerstrm
Go on
I did some work on my own on him...  ...before you hired me
I haven't looked at it all...  ...because you and HarrietfuckingVanger...  ...have kept me busy
But I may have something
You may have something
Maybe
They launder money from arms and drug sales...  ...and crime syndicates in Russia
And that money accounts for all but 5 percent of his holdings
The rest ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands
And how do you know this
This time you don't want to know
This time I do want to know
I have access to his computer
And his accountant's and lawyer's
And how do you have that
I could've gotten it from a source inside the company
You didn't
But that's what you'll say
And what will you say to me
Well, that depends if you really want to know
I do
Mikael, how did you get access
<i>Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist...</i>  <i>...who, this time last year was convicted of libel...</i>  <i>...in a Stockholm courtroom...</i>  <i>...doesn't seem to have learned from his mistakes.</i>  <i>Or maybe he has.</i>  <i>In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges...</i>  <i>...the company that sued him, the Wennerstrm Group...</i>  The shit hits the fan
<i>...Of criminal activities on a global scale.</i>  What happens now
Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta, which won't wash
The police will investigate, Fl will investigate
It'll go to court
Maybe he'll go to prison
You think
Probably not
These guys never do
What's wrong with you
It's embarrassing
Tell me
I need to borrow some money
Fifty thousand
I have a chance to make an investment
It's a smart, safe investment
I really don't think I've got 50,000
Yes, you do
You have 65,000 in your two accounts
I'm sorry that I know that
You'll get the money back, I promise
Okay
Okay
You want a coffee
<i>These allegations, like the last one from this socalled journalist...</i>  <i>...are as ridiculous as they are untrue.</i>  <i>I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again, and I'm looking forward to it.</i>  <i>What about his documentation?</i>  <i>Fabricated
All of it.</i>  <i>The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite as certain as Mr. Wennerstrm of that.</i>  <i>If a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist alleges proves to be true...</i>  <i>...not only will there be a securities investigation...</i>  <i>...but an organizedcrime inquiry as well.</i>  <i>Mr
Blomkvist names no sources.</i>  <i>And we can't force him to
But we can look for them.</i>  <i> Beginning where
Those closest to Mr. Wennerstrm.</i>  <i>Only someone in the inner circle of a corporation like this...</i>  <i>...has access to this kind of information.</i>  <i>Mr
Wennerstrm isn't available for comment...</i>  <i>...but I'm happy to answer questions.</i>  <i> Where is he
At home, I imagine</i>  <i>No, he's not
Has he left the country?</i>  <i>I don't think so.</i>   Okay
Thank you
Thank you
Welcome to the Dolder Grand, miss
May I have your passport, please
<i>With his failure to appear...</i>  <i>...before a Security Exchange Commission panel...</i>  <i>...a warrant has been issued for the Wennerstrm Group CEO.</i>  <i>I can confirm that he left Sweden...</i>  <i>...on a private jet that landed in Paris last week.</i>  <i>Whether he's still there, we don't know.</i>  <i>He can be anywhere by now.</i>  Thank you
I have accounts at Bank of Kroenenfeld, Cayman Islands
I'd like to transfer them and convert to bonds
Naturally, you have the clearing codes
Naturally
How many accounts will you transfer
Thirty
This will take some time
You will receive 4 percent commission
I will
Then it won't be a waste of it
<i>A Swedish tourist vacationing here in Barbados...</i>  <i>...says he knows where fugitive financier HansErik Wennerstrm is:</i>  <i>Here, in this Caribbean island's capital, Bridgetown.</i>  <i>Police released this photo and believe it is the disgraced billionaire.</i>  How many of these would you like to convert for deposit
All 50, into five accounts
Yes
That looks correct
<i>The man who is now being called Sweden's Charles Ponzi...</i>  <i>...may no longer have a country to call home...</i>  <i>...but does have enough money to buy one.</i>  <i>According to the International Banking Commission...</i>  <i>Wennerstrm, a week after the Millennium article appeared</i>  <i>...on newsstands, began emptying accounts...</i>  <i>...at Bank of Kroenenfeld in the Cayman Islands.</i>  <i>That money, approximately 2 billion euros...</i>  <i>...was then spread over a number of accounts...</i>  <i>...with the help of this confederate, seen here in Zurich.</i>   Hey
Hey
The money I borrowed
Already
Thank you
Thank you
No, I quit
It was a good investment
It was okay
What are you doing later
I'm seeing my daughter
Okay
You look nice
It's Christmas again
I'll see you soon
<i>Mr
Wennerstrm won the libel case..</i>  You got that call in the office
I miss our meetings
I'm sure you don't
Why would you
I was always such a headache for you
Never showing up with good news, only problems
I have good news now
I made a friend
I mean, one that you'd approve of
I'm happy
<i>A man who authorities here in Marbella have confirmed...</i>  <i>...is fugitive HansErik Wennerstrm, shot three times in the head...</i>  <i>...in what police are calling a classic gangland execution.</i>  <i>The investigation into Wennerstrm's ties...</i>  <i>...to crime organizations worldwide will now turn into speculation.</i>  <i>Which of them caught up with him before Swedish authorities could?</i>  <i>Wennerstrm spent the last days of his flamboyant life...</i>   It's nice
Your father
A friend
Must be a very good friend
We're late
Fashionably late.Did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China  than there are people of any kind living in the United States
That can't possibly be true
It is
What would account for that
Well, first, an awful lot of people live in China, but here's my question
How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people  who all got 1600 on their SATs
I didn't know they take SATs in China
They don't
I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about me
You got a 1600
Yes
I could sing in an a Capella group, but I can't sing
Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC
Or you could get into a final club
Or I get into a final club
You know, from a woman's perspective,  sometimes not singing in an a Capella group is a good thing
This is serious
On the other hand, I do like guys who row crew
Well, I can't do that
I was kidding
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test
Have you ever tried
I'm trying right now
To row crew
To get into a final club
To row crew
No
Are you, like, whatever, delusional
Maybe it's just sometimes you say two things at once
I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to be aiming at
But you've seen guys who row crew, right
No
Okay, well, they're bigger than me
They're worldclass athletes
And a second ago, you said you like guys who row crew  so I assumed you had met one
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys
Okay
Should we get something to eat
Would you like to talk about something else
No
It's just since the beginning of the conversation about finals club,  I think I may have missed a birthday
There are really more people in China with genius IQs than the entire population..
The Phoenix is the most diverse
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc
Which one
The Porcellian, the Porc
It's the best of the best
Which Roosevelt
Theodore
Is it true that they send a bus around to pick up girls  who want to party with the next Fed chairman
So you can see why it's so important to get in
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into
Why would you ask me that
I was just asking
None of them
That's the point
My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer  and Eduardo won't come close to getting in
The ability to make money doesn't impress anybody around here
Must be nice
He made $300,000 in a summer
He likes meteorology
You said it was oil futures
You can read the weather, you can predict the price of heating oil
I think you asked me that  because you think the final club that's easiest to get into  is the one where I'll have the best chance
I... What
You asked me which one was the easiest to get into  because you think that that's the one where I'll have the best chance
The one that's the easiest to get into would be the one  where anybody has the best chance
You didn't ask me which one was the best one,  you asked me which one was the easiest one
I was honestly just asking, okay
I was just asking to ask
Mark, I'm not speaking in code
Erica
You're obsessed with finals clubs
You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about it  who will prescribe you some sort of medication
You don't care if the side effects may include blindness
Final clubs
Not "finals clubs.
And there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated
Yes
There is
Well, you do
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code
I didn't mean to be cryptic
I'm just saying I need to do something substantial  in order to get the attention of the clubs
Why
Because they're exclusive
And fun, and they lead to a better life
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president  because he was a member of the Phoenix Club
He was a member of the Porcellian, and yes, he did
Well, why don't you just concentrate on being the best you you can be
Did you really just say that
I was kidding
Just because something's trite doesn't make it less true
I wanna try to be straightforward with you  and tell you I think you might want to be a little more supportive
If I get in, I will be taking you to the events and the gatherings,  and you'll be meeting a lot of people you wouldn't normally get to meet
You would do that for me
We're dating
Okay
Well, I wanna try and be straightforward with you  and let you know that we're not anymore
What do you mean
We're not dating anymore
I'm sorry
Is this a joke
No, it's not
You're breaking up with me
You're gonna introduce me to people  I wouldn't normally have the chance to meet
What the... What is that supposed to mean
Wait, settle down
What is it supposed to mean
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink right now  is 'cause you used to sleep with the door guy
"The door guy"
His name is Bobby
I have not slept with the door guy
The door guy is a friend of mine, and he's a perfectly good class of people
And what part of Long Island are you from, Wimbledon
Wait
Wait, wait
I'm going back to my dorm
Is this real
Yes
Then wait, I apologize, okay
I have to go study
Erica
Yes
I'm sorry, I mean it
I appreciate that, but I have to go study
Come on, you don't have to study
Let's just talk
I can't
Why
Because it is exhausting
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster
All I meant is that you're not likely to..
Currently..
I wasn't making a comment on your appearance
I was saying that you go to BU
I was stating a fact, that's all,  and if it seemed rude, then I apologize
I have to go study
You don't have to study
Why do you keep saying I don't have to study
'Cause you go to BU
Do you want to get some food
I am sorry you are not sufficiently impressed with my education
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat, so we're even
I think we should just be friends
I don't want friends
I was just being polite
I have no intention of being friends with you
I'm under some pressure right now from my OS class  and if we could just order some food, I think we should..
Okay, you are probably going to be a very successful computer person
But you're gonna go through life thinking that girls don't like you  because you're a nerd
And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that won't be true
It'll be because you're an asshole
Erica Albright's a bitch
Do you think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht,  or do you think it's because all BU girls are bitches
For the record, she may look like a 34C,  but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret
She's a 34B, as in barely anything there
False advertising
The truth is, she has a nice face
I need to do something to take my mind off her
Easy enough, except I need an idea
I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie
So what if it's not even 10:00 p.m. And it's a Tuesday night
Billy
The Kirkland facebook is open on my desktop,  and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics
Billy Olson's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of the pictures  next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter
Good call, Mr. Olson
Yeah, it's on
I'm not gonna do the farm animals,  but I like the idea of comparing two people together
It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel  since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit  than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness,  like they do on hotornot
Com
The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook,  so I'm going to have to get all the images  from the individual houses that people are in
Let the hacking begin
First up is Kirkland
They keep everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration
So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook
Kids' stuff
Next is Eliot
They're also open, but with no indexes on Apache
I can run an empty search  and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page
And I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me
Excellent
Moving right along
Excuse me
Everybody
You are at one of the oldest, one of the most exclusive clubs,  not just at Harvard, but in the world
And I want to welcome you all  to Phoenix Club's first party of the fall semester
Lowell has some security
They require a user name/password combo,  and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't have access to the main FAS user database,  so they have no way of detecting an intrusion
Adams has no security, but limits the number of results to 20 a page
All I need to do is break out the same script I used on Lowell and we're set
Quincy has no online facebook
What a sham
Nothing I can do about that
Dunster is intense
Not only is there no public directory, but there's no directory at all
You have to do searches,  and if your search returns more than 20 matches, nothing gets returned
And once you do get results, they don't link directly to the images
They link to a PHP that redirects or something
Weird
This may be difficult
I'll come back later
Hey, Shark Week's on
What
Great white, beautiful fish
Nice
Leverett is a little better
They still make you search,  but you can do an empty search and get links to pages with every student's picture
It's slightly obnoxious that they only let you view one picture at a time,  and there's no way I'm going to go to 500 pages to download pics one at a time
So it's definitely necessary to break out Emacs and modify that Perl script
Here you go
Done
Hey, what's going on
Perfect timing
Eduardo's here and he's going to have the key ingredient
Hey, Mark
Wardo
You and Erica split up
How did you know that
It's on your blog
Yeah
Are you all right
I need you
I'm here for you
No, I need the algorithm you use to rank chess players
Are you okay
We're ranking girls
You mean other students
Yeah
You think this is such a good idea
I need the algorithm
Mark..
I need the algorithm
Give each girl a base rating of 1400
At any given time Girl A has a rating Ra and Girl B has a rating Rb
When any two girls are matched up, there's an expectation of which will win  based on their current rating, right
Yeah
And those expectations are expressed this way
Let's write it
One on the left
The right
Yeah, still the right
It works
Who should we send it to first
Dwyer
Neal
Who are you gonna send it to
Just a couple of people
The question is,  who are they gonna send it to
Hey, guys, check this out
Someone go to the left
Dude, do left
Look at these girls
Right or left
Left is hot
Left
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Right or left
That's my roommate
Oh, my God
The girl on the left
This is pathetic
Right
Left
Left
Left
Oh, shit
Albright
He blogged about you
You don't wanna read it
Left
Latina
Erica
Is this yours
I stole it from a tranny
Get the hell out of here
Left
One on the right
Left
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down before we get into trouble
Hello
Wait, wait, wait, wait
What
At 4:00 in the morning
Well, there's a very unusual amount of traffic to the switch at Kirkland
You're saying it's unusual for 4:00 in the morning
No, this'd be unusual for halftime at the Super Bowl
All right
I gotta go in
What's going on
Harvard's network is about to crash
You don't think..
I do
Go see if it's everybody's
I can't connect
The network's down
Unless it's a coincidence, I think this is us
It's not a coincidence
Holy shit
So you were called in front of the Ad Board
That's not what happened
You weren't called in front of the Administrative Board
No, back
I mean back at the bar with Erica Albright
She said all that
Mark...  That I said that stuff to her
I was reading from the transcript of her deposition
Yeah, why would you even need to depose her
That's really for us to decide
You think if I know she can make me look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute
Can we do that
It's been almost three hours
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg  with the girl's testimony from the bar
I'm not embarrassed, she just made a lot of that up
She was under oath
Then I guess that would be the first time somebody's lied under oath
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours
Thousand
What
Twentytwo thousand
Wow
These guys are just freaking fast
Is there any way to make this a fair fight
Jump out and swim
I think we'd have to jump out and drown
Well, you could row forward and I could row backward
We're genetically identical
Science says we'd stay in one place
Just row the damn boat
You guys hear about this
What
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked the network from a laptop at Kirkland
Really
At 4:00 a.m.  How
He set up a website where you vote on the hotness of female undergrads
What were we doing that none of us heard about this
I don't know
A threehour lowrate technical row before breakfast
Full course load
Studying
Another three hours in the tank and then studying
I'm not sure how we missed it
How much activity was there on this thing
Twentytwo thousand page requests
Twentytwo thousand
Cam, this guy hacked the facebook of seven houses
He set up the whole website in one night, and he did it while he was drunk
Twentytwo thousand
Well, how do you know he was drunk
He was blogging simultaneously
You know what I think
Way ahead of you
This is our guy
Cameron Winklevoss
WlNKLEVOSS
"Cameron" spelled the usual way
Tyler Winklevoss
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my last name is the same as my brother's
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative Board hearing
You're being accused of intentionally breaching security,  violating copyrights,  violating individual privacy by creating the website www.facemash.com
You're also charged with being in violation of university policy,  on distribution of digitized images
Before we begin with our questioning, you're allowed to make a statement
Would you like to do so
I...  You know, I've already apologized in The Crimson to the ABHW,  to Fuerza Latina,  and to any women at Harvard who may have been insulted,  as I take it that they were
As for any charges stemming from the breach of security,  I believe I deserve some recognition from this board
I'm sorry
Yes
I don't understand
Which part
You deserve recognition
I believe I've pointed out some pretty gaping holes in your system
Excuse me, may I
Yes
Mr. Zuckerberg,  I'm in charge of security for all computers on the Harvard network,  and I can assure you of its sophistication
In fact, it was that level of sophistication that led us to you in less than four hours
Four hours
Yes, sir
That would be impressive,  except if you had known what you were looking for,  you would have seen it written on my dorm room window
So
Six months academic probation
Wow
Well, they had to make an example out of you
They had my blog
I shouldn't have written that thing about the farm animals
That was stupid
But I was kidding, for God's sakes
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor
I tried to stop you
I know
How do you do this thing where you manage to get all girls to hate us
And why do I let you
I know
You can't do that
Wardo, I said I know
Okay, let's look at a sample problem
Suppose we're given a computer with a 16bit virtual address  and a page size of 256 bytes
The system uses onelevel page tables that start at address hex 400
Maybe you want DMA on your 16bit system
Who knows
The first few pages are reserved for hardware flags, etc
Assume pagetable entries have eight status bits
The eight status bits would then be..
Anybody
And I see we have our first surrender
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg
Brighter men than you have tried and failed this class
One valid bit, one modified bit, one reference bit and five permission bits
That is correct
Does everybody see how he got there
Mark
You Mark Zuckerberg
Yeah
Cameron Winklevoss
Hi
Tyler Winklevoss
Are you guys related
That's good
Funny
We never heard that before
So, what can I do for you
Did I insult your girlfriends
No
You didn't
Actually, I don't know
Yeah, we never asked
We should do that
No
We have an idea we want to talk to you about
You got a minute
You guys look like you spend some time at the gym
We have to
Why
We row crew
Yeah, I've got a minute
Great
So, you ever been inside the Porcellian
No
You understand we can't take you past the bike room,  because you're not a member
I've heard
You want a sandwich or something
Okay
Mark, right
Yeah
Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner
Hi
We were really impressed with Facemash
When we checked you out, you also built CourseMatch
I don't know CourseMatch
You go online and see what courses your friends are taking
It's really smart, man
Mark
Yeah
We were talking about CourseMatch
It was kind of a nobrainer
But you invented something in high school, too, right
An app for an MP3 player that recognizes your taste in music
Anybody try to buy it
Microsoft
Wow
How much
Didn't sell it
Uploaded it for free
For free
Yeah
Why
Okay, well, we have something that we've been working on for a while  and we think it's great
It's called the Harvard Connection
You create your own page
Interests, bio, friends, pics
And then people can go online, see your bio, request to be your...  Yeah, how is that different from MySpace or Friendster
Harvard
Edu
Harvard
Edu is the most prestigious email address in the country, man
I mean, the whole site's kind of based on the idea that girls...  Not to put anything indelicately, but..
Girls wanna go with guys who go to Harvard
Divya and my brother don't have trouble putting things indelicately
The main difference between what we're talking about and MySpace or Friendster,  or any of those other social networking sites is...  Is exclusivity
Right
Right
Yeah
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark
I mean, we need a gifted programmer who's creative
And we know that you've been taking it in the shins
Women's groups are ready to declare a fatwa
But, you know, this could help rehabilitate your image
Wow
You would do that for me
We'd like to work with you
Our first programmer graduated and went to work for Google
Our second programmer just got overwhelmed with schoolwork
We would need you to build the site and write the code, and we'll provide all the..
I'm in
What
I'm in
Awesome
That's what you said
It was three or four years ago
I don't know what I said
When did you come to Eduardo
I don't understand that question
Do you remember answering in the affirmative
The affirmative
When did you come to Eduardo with the idea for Facebook
It was called The Facebook then
This doesn't need to be that difficult
I'm currently in the middle of two different lawsuits
Did you answer affirmatively  when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra  asked you to build Harvard Connection
Did you say yes
I said I'd help
When did you approach Mr. Saverin with the idea for The Facebook
I wouldn't say I approached him
Sy
You can answer the question
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi
What's that
The Jewish fraternity
It was Caribbean Night
It's not that guys like me are generally attracted to Asian girls
It's that Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me
I'm developing an algorithm to define the connection  between Jewish guys and Asian girls
I don't think it's that complicated
They're hot, they're smart,  they're not Jewish, and they can't dance
Hey, Mark's here
Mark
Be right back
I think I've come up with something
Hang on
I gotta tell you something that you're not gonna believe
What
I got punched by the Phoenix
Are you kidding
No
I mean, it's just the first of a fourstep process,  but they slid the invitation under my door tonight
I go to my first punch party tomorrow
So...  You got punched by the Phoenix
Yeah, but, you know, it was probably just a diversity thing
It was just a diversity thing
Just ride that horse until...  What did you wanna talk to me about
Mark
Yeah
You said you'd come up with something
Yeah, I think I've come up with something
Come outside and let's talk
It's 20 degrees outside
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,  which has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean
People came to Facemash in a stampede, right
Yeah
But it wasn't because they saw pictures of hot girls
You can go anywhere on the Internet and see pictures of hot girls
Yeah
It was because they saw pictures of girls that they knew
People want to go on the Internet and check out their friends,  so why not build a website that offers that
Friends, pictures, profiles, whatever you can visit
Browse around
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party
But I'm not talking about a dating site
I'm talking about taking the entire social experience of college and putting it online
I can't feel my legs
I know
I'm totally psyched about this, too
But, Wardo
Yeah
"It would be exclusive.
You would have to know the people on the site to get past your own page
Like getting punched
Now, that's good
Wardo, it's like a final club, except we're the president
I told him I thought it sounded great
It was a great idea
There was nothing to hack
People were gonna provide their own pictures, their own information
And people had the ability to invite, or not invite, their friends to join
See, in a world where social structure was everything,  that was the thing
It was a big project,  and he was going to have to write tens of thousands of lines of code,  so I wondered why he was coming to me and not his roommates,  Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes
They were programmers
We're gonna need a little startup cash to rent the servers and get it online
So that was why
Did he offer terms
Yes
We'll split it, 70/30
70 for me, 30 for you for putting up the $1,000  and for handling everything on the business end
You're CFO
And you said
I said, "Let's do it.
Okay
Did he add anything else
Yes
It probably was a diversity thing
But so what
Why do you think he said that
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting, but whose discovery is this
Sy, if you'll let me continue with my line of questioning
What are you suggesting
That I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched by the Phoenix  and began a plan to screw him out of a company   I hadn't even invented yet
Were you
Gretchen
Jealous of Eduardo
Stop typing
We're off the record
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,  and so you know that money isn't a big part of my life
But at the moment, I could buy Mount Auburn Street,  take the Phoenix Club and turn it into my pingpong room
I'll let you know how the party is
We recognize that you're a plaintiff in one suit involving Facebook,  and a witness in another
Yes, sir
At any time in the weeks prior to Mark's telling you his idea,  did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss,  Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection
Yes
He said they'd asked him to work on their site,  but that he looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time
He said even his most pathetic friends  knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys
"These guys," meaning my clients
Yes
He resented... Mark resented that your clients thought  that he needed to rehabilitate his image after Facemash
But Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything
With Facemash, he'd hacked into the Harvard computers,  he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board, he'd gotten a lot of notoriety
Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to do
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building The Facebook,  he was also communicating with the plaintiffs
Not at the time, I wasn't
But..
It really didn't have much to do with the Winklevosses' dating site
How would you know
You weren't even there
Ty
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building The Facebook,  he was leading the plaintiffs to believe he was building Harvard Connection
You're offering a conclusion not found in evidence
We are about to find it in evidence
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss
November 30th, 2003
"I read over all the stuff you sent me re: Harvard Connection
"And it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement
"So we can talk about it after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night.
From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron Winklevoss
December 1 st, 2003
"Sorry I was unreachable tonight
I just got about three of your missed calls
"I was working on a problem set for my systems class.
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
December 10, 2003
"This week has been pretty busy thus far with classes and work,  "so I think it's probably best to postpone the meeting.
"I'm also really busy tomorrow.
Okay, anybody else feel like there's something up with this guy
Tell him okay,  but we do have to make sure that we meet up before we all go off for break
I know, I know
Yeah, watch out
Hey, Mark
I need a dedicated Linux box running Apache with a MySQL back end
It's gonna cost a little more money
How much more
About 200 more
Do we need it
Gotta handle the traffic
Do it
I already did
Hey, guess what
I made the second cut
That's good
You should be proud of that right there
Don't worry if you don't make it any further
I'll get out of here
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss  and Divya Narendra
December 15th, 2003
"I have a CS problem set that I'm just getting started with  "and it should be about 15 hours of coding, so I'll be busy tomorrow night.
"I won't really be free to meet until next Wednesday afternoon.
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon
"I've basically been in the lab this whole time, and also I..."  "...won't be able to do Saturday, as I have to meet up with my parents.
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard, founder of Harvard University in 1638
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies
What are the three lies
Mr. Dowd
The three lies
First...  Shit
Take your pants off
I know
Mr. Saverin
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638
Two, Harvard was not founded by John Harvard
And three, that is not John Harvard
Who is it
It's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester
Keep your jacket on
Thirtynine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's initial meeting with my clients,  and he still hadn't completed work on Harvard Connection
But on January 11th, 2004,  Mr. Zuckerberg registered the domain name The Facebook  via Network Solutions
To the best of your knowledge, had he even begun work on Harvard Connection
Not to my knowledge
No
What in the world is this
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site  "to really draw the attention and gain the critical mass necessary  "to get a site like this to run"
"We'll speak soon"
This is the first time he mentioned any problem
Yes, it was
You sent 36 emails to Mr. Zuckerberg and received 16 emails in return,  and this was the first time he indicated he was not happy
That's correct
He had 42 days to study our system and get out ahead
Do you see any of your code on Facebook
Sy, could you...  Did I use any of your code
You stole our whole goddamn idea
Fellas
What
Match.com for Harvard guys
Can I continue with my deposition
You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,  you'd have invented Facebook
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder and watch you write us a check
No shit
Let's continue
February 4, 2004
Mark
There is a girl in your art history class
Her name is Stephanie Attis
Do you happen to know if she has a boyfriend
Have you ever seen her with anyone
And, if not, do you happen to know if she's looking to go out with anyone
Dustin
People don't walk around with a sign on them that says...  Mark
We were supposed to meet at 9:00
Have you slept yet
I have to add something
What
Shit, that looks good
That looks really good
It's clean and simple
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls.
But watch
What'd you write
"Relationship Status.
"Interested In.
This is what drives life at college
"Are you having sex or aren't you?
It's why people take certain classes and sit where they sit and do what they do
And at its center, you know, that's what The Facebook is gonna be about
People are gonna log on because after all the cake and watermelon,  there's a chance they're actually gonna...   Gonna get laid
...meet a girl
Yes
That is really good
And that was it
What do you mean
It's ready
It's ready
Right now
Yeah
That was it
And here's the masthead
You made a masthead
Yeah
"Eduardo Saverin, cofounder and CFO.
Yeah
You have no idea what that's gonna mean to my father
Sure I do
So when's it going live
Right now
Get your laptop out
What
Why do we need my laptop
Because you got emails for everybody at the Phoenix
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool with them that I spam their emails
This is not spam
No, I know it's not spam
If we send it to our friends, it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin
I haven't gotten in yet
These guys know people
And I need their emails
Sure
Good
Give me the mailing list
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu
These guys
Yeah, they're literary geniuses  because the world's most obvious Lewis Carroll reference is in..
They're not so bad
I'm just saying
Yeah, you're right
The site's live
You know, let's go get a drink and celebrate
I'm buying
Mark
Mark, are you praying
Whatever happened to Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
It's a Valentine's Day theme
They're playing love songs
Good point
'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin never wrote any love songs
Honey, you should put your laptop away
Seven different people spammed me the same link
KC
What is it
I don't know
But I'm really hoping it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,  'cause I can never get enough of that
No, it's not
Div
What
This isn't mine
Okay, what is wrong
It's fine
It's fine
It's fine
Hey
Not now
We need 20 minutes
Okay
I just wanted to let you know that Zuckerberg stole our website
Mark Zuckerberg
He stole our website
It's been live for more than 36 hours
Mr. Hotchkiss
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler and our business partner Divya
"Welcome to The Facebook
"The Facebook is an online directory that connects people  "through different social networks
"You must have a harvard
Edu address to register.
Yeah, I called earlier
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg
Yes, sir
He's actually quoted a couple times
I can read it to you
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal facebook within Harvard,' he says.
"He" meaning Mark
"'I think it's kind of silly that it would take the university  "'a couple of years to get around to it
"'I can do a classier job than they can and I did it in a week."
Tell him Divya Narendra called
I know, that's how he talks
Appreciate it
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,  "over 650 students had registered to use thefacebook
Com
"He said he anticipated that 900 students would have joined the site by this morning.
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650 students signed up for it on the first day
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't give free drugs to 650 people in one day
And this guy doesn't have three friends to rub together to make a fourth
All right
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss
We'll put all this together and we'll email it to you
Well, you won't be able to go on the website yourself
Because you don't have a Harvard...  You know what, it would just be easier for us to email it to you
I'm sure you're right
He's a good guy and he's very bright and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...  Wow
...what he did
All right, thank you very much
And, Dad...  All right, love you, too
This is a good guy
We don't know that he's not a good guy
We know he stole our idea
We know he lied to our faces for a month and a half
No, he never lied to our faces
Okay, he never saw our faces
Fine, he lied to our email accounts and he gave himself a 42day head start,  because he knows what apparently you don't,  which is that getting there first is everything
I'm a competitive racer, Div
I don't think you need to school me in the importance of getting there first
Thank you
That was your father's lawyer
It was his inhouse counsel
He's gonna look at all this and if he thinks it's appropriate  he'll send a ceaseanddesist letter
What's that gonna do
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer and sue him
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat the shit out of him with a hammer
We don't even have to do that
That's right
We could do that ourselves
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me
I'm with this guy
Well, whatever
I'm saying, let's calm down until we know what we're talking about
How much more information are you waiting for
We met with Mark three times, we exchanged 52 emails,  we can prove that he looked at the code
What is that on the bottom of the page
It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production.
On the home page
On every page
Shit, I need a second to let the classiness waft over me
Okay, look, we don't know...  Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said he hoped the privacy options  "would help restore his reputation  "following student outrage over facemash
Com.
That's exactly what we said to him
He's giving us the finger in The Crimson
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer to look this stuff over,  we can at least get something going in the paper so people know...   What
...that this is in dispute
We're not starting a knife fight in The Crimson
And we're not suing anybody
Why not
I don't understand, I don't understand
Why not
He's gonna say it's stupid
What, who, me
Say it
Why not
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard
This is Harvard, where you don't plant stories and you don't sue people
You thought he was gonna be the only one who thought that was stupid
During the time when you say you had this idea,  did you know Tyler and Cameron came from a family of means
"A family of means"
Did you know their father was wealthy
I'm not sure why you're asking me that
It's not important you be sure why I'm asking
It's not important to you
Sy
Did you know that they came from money
I had no idea whether they came from money or not
In one of your emails to Mr. Narendra,  you referenced Howard Winklevoss' consulting firm
If you say so
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose assets are in the hundreds of millions
You also knew Tyler and Cameron were members  of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian
They pointed that out
Excuse us for inviting you in
To the bike room
Please
So it's safe to say you were aware that my clients had money
Yes
Let me tell you why I'm asking
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000 for an Internet venture,  you didn't ask my clients for it
They had demonstrated an interest to you in that kind of thing
I went to my friend for the money because that's who I wanted to be partners with
Eduardo was the president of the Harvard Investors Association,  and he was also my best friend
Your best friend is suing you for $600 million
I didn't know that
Tell me more
Eduardo, what happened after the initial launch
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind addressing him as Mr. Saverin
Gretchen, they're best friends
Not anymore
Well, we already went through this on the... Never mind
Mr. Saverin, what happened after the initial launch
It exploded
Everybody on campus was using it
"Facebook me" was a common expression after two weeks
And Mark
And Mark was the biggest thing on a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,  15 Pulitzer Prize winners, two future Olympians, and a movie star
Who was the movie star
Does it matter
No
...at Out of Town News and picked up that copy of Popular Electronics magazine  with the MIT'S Altair kit on the cover
It was a beautiful day and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room
He brought that magazine up and he showed it to me and he said,  "Look, it's gonna happen without us
We've gotta start now.
And I said, "Okay
Let's get BASIC out there.
Now, most of you think you know the rest of the story, but you may not
The beginnings of this industry were very humble
That kit computer on the cover of that magazine had an 8080 processor in it
Unless you paid extra for a 1 K memory board, you got 256 bytes
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC wasn't just to run at 4 kbytes,  but I also had to leave room for the users to run their programs in 4 kbytes
Your friend
Is that Mark Zuckerberg
Yeah
He made The Facebook
Yeah
I mean, it's both of ours
We're...  Yeah, we..
Yes
Cool
I'm Christy Ling
This is Alice
Hi
Well, very nice to meet you
Facebook me when you get home
You know, maybe we can all go out and grab a drink
Certainly
Absolutely do that
She said, "Facebook me and we can all go for a drink later,"  which is stunningly great for two reasons
One, she said "facebook me," right
And then the other is, well, you know..
They wanna have drinks later
Yes, have you ever heard so many different good things  packed into one regularsized sentence
Excuse me, Mark
Yeah
I'm Stuart Singer
I'm in your OS lab
Sure
Awesome job with The Facebook
Awesome job
Thanks
I'm Bob
How you doing
You know, I could swear he was looking at you  when he said the next Bill Gates could be right in this room
I doubt it
And I showed up late
I don't even know who the speaker was
It was Bill Gates
Shit, that makes sense
All right
Thanks, guys
Are you a moron
Are you medically stupid
You can't tell Bill Gates is in front of you for an hour
I wasn't wearing my contacts
Can I get a Glock and kill you
It's time to monetize the thing
What were their names
Hear what I just said
When
I said it's time to monetize the site
What does that mean
It means it's time for the website to start generating revenue
No, I know what the word means
I'm asking how you wanna do it
Advertising
No
Well, we got 4,000 members
'Cause The Facebook is cool,  and if we start installing popups for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool
Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew, but at some point,  and I'm talking as the business end of the company, the site...  We don't even know what it is yet
We don't know what it is
We don't know what it can be
We don't know what it will be
We know that it is cool
That is a priceless asset I'm not giving up
So when will it be finished
It won't be finished
That's the point
The way fashion's never finished
What
Fashion
Fashion is never finished
You're talking about fashion
Really, you
I'm talking about the idea of it and I'm saying that it's never finished
Okay
But they manage to make money selling pants
Mark, what is this
What
This
It's called a ceaseanddesist letter
What were their names
Who
The girls
When did you get this
About 10 days ago
Right after we launched the site
Jesus Christ
Hey, the girls
What were their names
The Winklevoss twins are saying that you stole their idea
I find that to be a little more than mildly annoying
Oh, well, they find it to be intellectual property theft
Look...  Why didn't you show this to me
It was addressed to me
They're saying that we stole The Facebook from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses
I know what it says
Did we
Did we what
Don't screw around with me now
Look at me
The letter says we could face legal action
No, it says I could face legal action
This is from a lawyer, Mark
They must feel they have some grounds
The lawyer is their father's house counsel
Do they have grounds
The grounds are our thing is cool and popular,  and Harvard Connection is lame
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code, I promise
I didn't use anything
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair doesn't owe money  to everyone who ever has built a chair, okay
They came to me with an idea, I had a better one
Why didn't you show me this letter
I didn't think it was a big deal
Okay
So if there's something wrong, if there's ever anything wrong, you can tell me
I'm the guy that wants to help
This is our thing
Now, is there anything that you need to tell me
No
What are we doing about this
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services and he told me to write them back
And what did you say
"When we met in January, I expressed my doubts about the site
"Where it stood with graphics, how much programing was left  "that I had not anticipated.
"The lack of hardware we had to deal with site use,  "the lack of promotion that would go on to successfully launch the website.
This was the first time you raised any of those concerns, right
I'd raised concerns before
Bullshit
Not to us
Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting in January to which this letter is referring
Yeah
Let me rephrase this
You sent my client 16 emails
In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns
Is that a question
In the 16th email you raised concerns about the site's functionality
Were you leading them on for six weeks
No
Then why didn't you raise any of these concerns before
It's raining
I'm sorry
It just started raining
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention
No
Do you think I deserve it
What
Do you think I deserve your full attention
I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition  and I don't wanna perjure myself, so I have a legal obligation to say no
Okay
No
You don't think I deserve your attention
I think if your clients wanna sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall,  they have a right to give it a try,  but there's no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie
You have part of my attention
You have the minimum amount
The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook,  where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room,  including and especially your clients,  are intellectually or creatively capable of doing
Did I adequately answer your condescending question
Well, I have 12:45
Why don't we say that's lunch
Back at 2:30
So what were their names
Their names were Christy and Alice,  and they wanna have drinks tonight
You're not supposed to be in here
This is a men's room
Wow
Oh, my God
I don't care
Hey, man, sorry
A couple girls are freshening up in there
Sweet
We have groupies
I'll be right back
Mark, where you going
Mark
Erica
Hi
I saw you from over there
I didn't know you came to this club a lot
First time
Mine, too
Could I talk to you alone for a second
I think I'm good right here
I just..
I'd love to talk to you alone if we could just go someplace
Right here is fine
I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched
No
The Facebook
You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark
That's why I wanted to talk to you
On the Internet
That's why I came over
Comparing women to farm animals
I didn't end up doing that
It didn't stop you from writing it
As if every thought that tumbles through your head was so clever  it would be a crime for it not to be shared
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink,  and you published that Erica Albright was a bitch,  right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, my bra size,  and then rated women based on their hotness
Erica, is there a problem
No, there's no problem
You write your snide bullshit from a dark room  because that's what the angry do nowadays
I was nice to you
Don't torture me for it
If we could just go somewhere for a minute..
I don't wanna be rude to my friends
Okay
Good luck with your video game
Hey, that was great
That was the right thing to do
You apologized, right
We have to expand
Sure
Mark
Is he mad about something
Okay, we are expanding to Yale and Columbia
Dustin, I want you to share the coding work with me
Chris, you're gonna be in charge of publicity and outreach,  and you could start by getting a story in the BU student newspaper
It's The Bridge
They hate doing stories about Harvard
Somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free programing
Why do you want a story in the BU newspaper
Because I do
Now here's the arrangement
Eduardo is CFO and owns 30% of the company
Dustin is vice president and head of programing,  and his 5% of the company will come from my end
Chris is director of publicity,  and his compensation will depend on how much work he ends up doing
Any questions
Who are the girls
Sorry
They're Christy and Alice
Hi
Hi
Hello
Hi
Is there anything we can do
No, that's it
Yale and Columbia, let's go
And Stanford
What
Stanford
It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto
You don't want any lunch
No
You're welcome to some salad
No, thank you
This must be hard
Who are you
I'm Marylin Delpy
I introduced myself when we first..
I mean, what do you do
I'm a secondyear associate at the firm
My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase
What are you doing
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia
Bosnia
They don't have roads, but they have Facebook
You must really hate the Winklevosses
I don't hate anybody
The Winklevi aren't suing me for intellectual property theft
They are suing me because for the first time in their lives,  things didn't work out the way they were supposed to for them
He's expanding
What
He's expanding to Yale, Columbia and Stanford
It's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow
Really
Yep
Well, looks like that ceaseanddesist letter really scared the shit out of him, huh
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief and get the site taken down now
Every minute the site is up, Harvard Connection becomes less valuable
I want an injunction
I want damages
I want punitive relief
And I want him dead
Yeah, I want those things, too
Then why aren't we doing anything about it
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard
No, it's because you're not thinking how it's gonna look
How's it gonna look
Like my brother and I are in skeleton costumes  chasing the Karate Kid around a high school gym
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law
When he goes to Connecticut, New York and California,  he'll have violated federal law
And, by the way, he's in violation of Harvard law
There's no such thing as Harvard law
Wait
Yeah, there is
Harvard Student Handbook
Every freshman is issued one of these, and somewhere in this book it says...  You can't steal from another student
This is what we needed
We're going to Summers
Well, you can't get a meeting with Larry Summers
My brother and I, we pay tuition at this school
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school
We've won trophies for this school
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics for this school
I want a meeting with the goddamn president of this school
Why Stanford
Why do you think
I'm sorry
I'm late for biochem
Okay
You don't know my name, do you
Is it Stanford
I should just kick your ass
How do you go to a party and you meet someone...  Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy
You're from Orinda
Your father's in commercial real estate and your mother's 10 years sober
What's my major
Trombone
Really
I remember something about a trombone
French
Your major's French
And yours
Mine
I don't have one
You haven't declared
I don't go to school
You're kidding
No
Well, where did you go to school
William Taft Elementary, for a little while
Seriously
You're not like 15 years old or anything, are you
No
Wait, you're not like 15, are you
No
So, what do you do
I'm an entrepreneur
You're unemployed
I wouldn't say that
What would you say
That I'm an entrepreneur
Well, then, what was your latest preneur
Well, I founded an Internet company that let folks download and share music for free
Kind of like Napster
Exactly like Napster
What do you mean
I founded Napster
Sean Parker founded Napster
Nice to meet you
You're Sean Parker
You see, the shoe's on the other..
Foot
Table, which has turned
I just slept with Sean Parker
You just slept on Sean Parker
You're a zillionaire
Not technically
What are you
Broke
There's not a lot of money in free music,  even less when you're being sued by everyone who's ever been to the Grammys
This is blowing my mind
I appreciate that
I gotta hop in the shower and get ready for class
Biochem, even though you're a French major whose name is Amy
You passed
I'm a hard worker
There's juice or anything else you can find
Help yourself
You mind if I check my email
Yeah, go ahead
Amy
Jesus
Amy
Can you come out here
Yeah
Just a second
There's a snake in here, Amy
What
Where
There isn't a snake, but I need to ask you something
Are you kidding me
I could've been killed
How
By running too fast and getting twisted in the curtain
What do you need to ask me
Yeah, I went to check my email and there's a website open on your computer
Yeah, after you passed out last night I went on The Facebook for a little bit
What's that
The Facebook
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now
It's really awesome, except it's freakishly addictive
Seriously, I'm on the thing like five times a day
Mind if I send myself an email
Yeah, is everything okay
Everything's great
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg
I've never been in this building before
This building's 100 years older than the country it's in, so do be careful
We're sitting in chairs
Yes
Very good
You can go in now
That's their own stupidity
I should've been there
Well, darkness is the absence of light,  and the stupidity in that instance was the absence of me
Catherine, I've got students in my office now
Students
Undergrads
I don't know
From the looks of it, they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise
All right, byebye
Good morning
Good morning, sir
I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler
And you're here because..
Either of you can answer
I'm sorry, sir, I thought you were reading the letter
I've read the letter
Well, we came up with an idea for a website called Harvard Connection...  We've since changed the name to ConnectU
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea..
I understand
And I'm asking what you want me to do about it
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman,  under the heading "Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community,"  it says the college expects all students to be honest and forthcoming  in their dealings with members in this community
Students are required to respect public and private ownership,  and instances of theft, misappropriation or...   Anne
Yes, sir
Punch me in the face
Go ahead
...or unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action,  including the requirement to withdraw from the college
And you memorized that instead of doing what
What my brother and I came here today to ask of you, respectfully, of course...  Sir, it's against university rules to steal from another student, plain and simple
And you've spoken to your House Master
Yes, sir
And the House Master made a recommendation to the Ad Board,  but the Ad Board won't see us
Have you tried dealing with the other student directly
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our emails or phone calls  for the last two weeks
He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland,  and the closest I've come to dealing with him facetoface  is when I saw him on the quad and chased him through Harvard Square
You chased him
I saw him and I know he saw me
I went after him and then he disappeared
I don't see this as a university issue
Of course this is a university issue
There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both
You enter into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what you just said makes no sense to me at all
I'm devastated by that
What my brother means is, if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room  and stole our computer, that would be a university issue
I really don't know
This office doesn't handle petty larceny
This isn't petty larceny
This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars
Millions
Yes
You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you
Sir, I honestly don't think you're in any position to make that call
I was the US Treasury Secretary
I'm in some position to make that call
Letting our imaginations run away with us  is exactly what we were told to do in your freshman address
Well, then I would suggest that you let your imaginations  run away with you on a new project
You would
Yes
Everyone at Harvard's inventing something
Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job
So I'll suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project
I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point
Please, arrive at the point
You don't have to be an intellectual property expert  to understand the difference between right and wrong
And you're saying that I don't
Of course I'm not saying that, sir
I'm saying that
Really
Sir
Anne, how did they get this appointment
Colleagues of their father
Let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,  since you're on the subject of right and wrong
This action, this meeting, the two of you being here is wrong
It's not worthy of Harvard
It's not what Harvard saw in you
You don't get special treatment
We never asked...  Just start another project
Like we're making a diorama for a science fair
If you have a problem with that, Mr. Winklevoss...  We never asked for special treatment
...the courts are always at your disposal
Is there anything else I can do for you
You can take the Harvard Student Handbook and shove it...  Ty
Thank you very much for your time, sir
Whoops
Broke your 335yearold doorknob
Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York
Yes
What was the purpose of the trip
Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings with potential advertisers
Who paid for the trip
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account I had set up a few months earlier
At this point, your $1,000 was the only money that had been put into the company
Yes
How did you feel the meetings went
They went terribly
Why
Mark was asleep
I was not asleep
Can I rephrase my answer
I wish he'd been asleep
So we're in 29 schools now, with over 75,000 members
People who go on The Facebook  tend to stay on longer than almost any other website
Now, here's the most impressive statistic
91% of people who try it once will come back
Now, if you'll allow me..
Excuse me one second
What sound is he making
Is that like a tsk
It wasn't a tsk
It was...  Like a glottal stop
Almost a gag reflex
Guys, what is this
There was one more meeting scheduled for the New York trip
Yes, it was a dinner
It was set up through my girlfriend at the time
Would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting
Yes
Very
Look, they're not gonna card us
They might
I mean, look around
It'll be embarrassing
Tell him they're not gonna card us
They're not gonna card us
Mark...  Are you gonna talk about ads again
Unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford,  the purpose of a business is to make a profit
It isn't a business yet
That's tough for me, 'cause my... Never mind
He's 25 minutes late
He founded Napster when he was 19
He can be late
He's not a god
Then what is he
He's 25 minutes late
I think Wardo's jealous
I honestly wasn't jealous
I was nervous
Why
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had done a search and I'd asked around
And he struck me as kind of a...  A wild card
Why
He crashed out of two pretty big Internet companies in spectacular fashion,  he's had a reputation with drugs..
He also founded the companies
We don't need him
He's here
No, no, take your time
And he does own a watch
Stop it
I'm Sean Parker
How do you do
You must be Eduardo
And Christy
And Mark
Great to meet you
Great to meet you
You guys don't have anything in front of you
No
Tori
We were waiting
Hey, baby boy
Can you bring out some things
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit
Tuna tartare
And the lobster claws, that'll get us started
Christy, what do you like to drink
An appletini
Great
Four of those
From that point on, it was a Seanathon
The question was, "What did you talk about?
He took us through his episode with Napster
I didn't wanna spend my 20s as a professional defendant
Who knew
The music industry doesn't have a sense of humor
We tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties,  but I guess to them that was a little like selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy
But you made a name for yourself
And you are dry
Tori
No, no, I'm good
And then he went on to his second business venture,  which was an online Rolodex that he got thrown out of by Case Equity
And I wanted to do it nice this time
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes, but nobody wants to take orders from a kid
So let me tell you what happens to a 20yearold at the top of a hot dotcom
I'm not a psychiatrist, but..
I'm glad we've got that on the record
You're not a psychiatrist, but what
A psychiatrist would say that he was paranoid
They'll hire private detectives who'll follow you day and night
You're a target for highpriced escorts
I can't prove it, but I know they tap my phones
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up, you've done already
Private behavior is a relic of a time gone by
And if somehow, someway, you've managed to live your life like the Dalai Lama,  they'll make shit up
Because they don't want you, they want your idea
And they want you to say "thank you" while you..
Excuse me
...wipe your chin and walk away
That's what happened to you
And delusional
Yes
But there'll be payback at Case
I brought down the record companies with Napster  and Case'll suffer for their sins, too
Sorry, you didn't bring down the record companies
They won
In court
Yeah
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo
And he told story after story about life in Silicon Valley,  and parties at Stanford and down in LA, and friends who'd become millionaires..
But mostly how Mark had to..
He had to come to California
And then he got around to The Facebook
So, tell me about your progress
Well, we're in 29 schools now
We got over 75,000 members
Tell me about the strategy you're using
Okay
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,  but Baylor already had a social network on campus
So instead of going right after them,  we made a list of every school within 100 miles...  You put The Facebook on those campuses first
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw their friends on our site and we were in
It's called the Little Bighorn
That's smart, Mark
Thanks, that was mine
Easy
Hey, you know what
Settle an argument for us
I say it's time to start making money from The Facebook,  but Mark doesn't want advertising
Who's right
Well..
Neither of you yet
The Facebook is cool, that's what it's got going for it
Yeah
You don't wanna ruin it with ads because ads aren't cool
Exactly
It's like you're throwing the greatest party on campus  and someone's saying it's gotta be over by 11:00
That's exactly right
You don't even know what the thing is yet
Exactly
How big it can get, how far it can go
This is no time to take your chips down
A million dollars isn't cool
You know what's cool
You
"A billion dollars.
And that shut everybody up
And that's where you're headed
A billiondollar valuation
Unless you take bad advice, in which case you may as well have come up with  a chain of very successful yogurt shops
When you go fishing, you can catch a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish
You ever walk into a guy's den and see a picture of him standing next to 14 trout
No, he's holding a 3,000pound marlin
Yep
That's a good analogy
Okay
But we all know marlins don't really weigh 3,000 pounds, right
Have you seen the big ones up close
No, but I don't think the guy's holding a marlin the size of a Range Rover
That would be a really big fish and a very strong guy
You think we might be getting away from the point
I don't have a dog in this fight
I'm just a fan who came to say hi
He owned Mark after that dinner
He picked up the check, he told Mark they'd talk again soon,  and he was gone
But not before he made his biggest contribution to the company
Drop the "The.
Just "Facebook.
It's cleaner
Shit
Goodbye, sweetie
Yeah
That's gotta be some kind of land speed record for talking
You wanna end the party at 11:00
I'm trying to pay for the party
There won't be a party unless it's cool
So, what do you think
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The.
I meant to catching the marlin instead of the 14 trout
Doesn't that sound good
If you're a trout
I'm going to enter this into the record
Incorporation papers for Facebook, an LLC registered in Florida
Why Florida
It's where my family lives
And ask the respondent to stipulate that the articles of incorporation  state the ownership as follows: 65% for Mark Zuckerberg,  30% for Eduardo Saverin and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz
Yeah, we stipulate
And that was April 13th, 2004
You can mark it
You have anything here
Yes
Thank you
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything  that might be considered legitimate grounds for termination
No
You never did anything to embarrass the company or even seriously jeopardize it
No
No
No
You were accused of animal cruelty
Wait
You weren't
This is not happening
I have here an article from The Crimson...  Jesus Christ
I can't have this, Wardo
Come on, man
This is bullshit
This is another club playing a prank
I'd gotten into the Phoenix
I'd been accepted, and as part of my initiation I had to,  for one week, carry with me at all times and take care of a chicken
They identify you as one of the founders of Facebook
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."  I'm not the expert, but being connected to torturing animals  is probably bad for business
I did not torture the chicken
I don't torture chickens
Are you crazy
No, and settle down, please
I have here an article from The Crimson..
This is scathing
956
I was having dinner in the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,  and I had the chicken with me,  because I had to have the chicken with me at all times
This was college
Somebody's gonna have to answer for this
969
And the dining hall was serving chicken for dinner,  and I had to feed my chicken, so I...  Well, I took little pieces of chicken and I gave it to the chicken
Someone must have seen me, because the next thing I knew  I was being accused of forced cannibalism
I didn't know you couldn't do that
I dealt with the various animal rights groups,  I dealt with the associate dean of the college
This was all resolved
988
Someone from the Porc or the Fly must have reported it
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses
All right, let's just forget about it
This is absurd
I'm being accused of animal cruelty
It's better to be accused of necrophilia
It is better to be accused of necrophilia
Now I have to explain this to my father
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody
What is happening on that
I have my final coming up for Postwar and Contemporary Art  and I haven't been to class
I'm supposed to write about these four paintings
That's a Facebook page
Yeah
I opened it under an alias
I posted the paintings and asked people to comment
Every once in a while, I hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating on his final exam
I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen
And why not
Because I'm not suing him for cheating on his final exam
That's not what friends do
Well, you just told us he was cheating
Oops
You told your lawyers I was torturing animals
No, he didn't tell us about it at all
Our litigators are capable of finding a Crimson article
In fact, when we raised the subject with him, he defended you
Oops
993
We are so close
Yeah, that reminds me, we're gonna need more money, Wardo
Yeah, no, I agree
More servers, more help
I'm interviewing two interns to come to Palo Alto  and we're gonna have to pay them something
Sorry, what
I already found a house for rent  on a street two blocks from the Stanford campus
It is perfect and it's got a pool
When did you decide to go to California for the summer
You mean when did I actually decide
Was it somewhere in the middle of the Sean Parker Variety Hour
He was right, California's the place we've gotta be
What, you're Jed Clampett
I didn't know you guys got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius
What is your problem with Sean
He doesn't bring anything to the table
He doesn't have money
Dustin's a better programmer
He's got connections to VCs
We don't need VCs, we need advertisers
And I have connections to VCs
No real players
And as somebody who's just really embarrassed the company in a bad way..
It was the Winklevosses, Mark
Hang on
Hit "Refresh.
150,004
150,000 members, Wardo
Congratulations, dude
Congratulations
You don't think it was strange that he was followed by private detectives
Who came up with nothing
Enough to get him out of the company
The drugs, the girls
We don't know that any of that's true
You can read about it
I can read about you torturing birds
Since when..
Okay, don't fish eat other fish
The marlins and the trout
What's he talking about
I'm interviewing interns at 10:00 tomorrow night in the CS lab
Get on board with this, man
You know, I don't really know what else to say
You can do one more
One more
Wardo
Yo
Mark
What's going on
They have 10 minutes to get root access to a Python web server,  expose its SSL encryption,  and then intercept all traffic over its secure port
They're hacking
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator
But here's the beauty
You know I didn't understand anything you just said, right
I do know that
So what's the beauty
Every tenth line of code written, they have to drink a shot
Hacking's supposed to be stealth, so every time the server detects an intrusion,  the candidate responsible has to drink a shot
I also have a program running that has a popup window  appear simultaneously on all five computers
The last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot
Plus, every three minutes they all have to drink a shot
Three minutes
Drink one now
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job will they need to be able to do drunk
You're right
A more relevant test might be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week
That was mean
Here
What is this
I opened a new account and put $18,000 in it
Will that get you through the summer
Here
Mark
Right here
Welcome to Facebook
$18,000
Yes
In addition to the $1,000 you'd already put up
Yes
A total of $19,000 now
Yes
Hang on
I'm just checking your math on that
Yes, I got the same thing
May I continue
After expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company  and moving it to California for the summer,  why did you put $18,000 in an account for his use
I figured we were partners
I wanted to be a team player
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on the site  while I was generating advertiser interest in New York
But mostly I figured, how much could possibly go wrong in three months
Go, go, go, go, go
I didn't die
I know
I made it
You did
Okay, ready
That was like an 8
That was like a 2
It was better than that
Yeah
I'm okay
You sure
Yeah
Yikes
That's the doorbell
I didn't know we had a doorbell
Andrew, get the door
No, he's wired in
That's gonna cut into your security deposit
Andrew
Not now
Good boy
Sean
Mark
Do you live here
Yeah
Do you
We were right across the street
We saw the chimney...   Is anybody hurt
No
You live across the street
I'm Sharon
This is my... Sharon
She lives across the street
I was helping her move out, we saw the chimney...  We had a zip line to the pool
You came to California
Yeah
You made the right choice
Here you go
Sharon
I'm so sorry
No problem
I didn't know you were gonna..
Here you go
No, no, no
Wait
This house and this team are great
It's exactly what it should be
I'm Sean Parker
Oh, he's wired in
That's what I'm talking about
Where's Eduardo
He got an internship in New York
Eduardo didn't come out
I was crashing there for a little bit while I'm taking care of some things,  but she's done for the summer so she's back at her parents' place
The homeless rock star of Palo Alto
All right
What's your plan for the summer
Mark
I'm sorry
I was looking at the architecture
I asked what your plan for the...  A hundred schools by the end of the summer
We're gonna go to the restroom
Okay
Yeah, I'll go with you
Your date looks so familiar to me
She looks familiar to a lot of people
What do you mean
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond wants to buy his wife some lingerie,  but he's too embarrassed to shop for it in a department store
He comes up with an idea for a highend place  that doesn't make you feel like a pervert
He gets a $40,000 bank loan, borrows another 40,000 from his inlaws,  opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret
Makes a half million dollars his first year
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores, and after five years, he sells the company  to Leslie Wexner and The Limited for $4 million
Happy ending, right
Except two years later, the company's worth $500 million,  and Roy Raymond jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife a pair of thighhighs, you know
Was that a parable
My date's a Victoria's Secret model
That's why she looks familiar to you
God
Don't be impressed by all this
I read your blog
You know, no, that was for web cretins
You know why I started Napster
The girl I loved in high school was with the cocaptain of the varsity lacrosse team,  and I wanted to take her from him
So I decided to come up with the next big thing
I didn't know that
Napster wasn't a failure
I changed the music industry for better and for always
It may not have been good business, but it pissed a lot of people off
And isn't that what your Facemash was about
They're scared of me, pal, and they're gonna be scared of you
What the VCs want is to say,  "Good idea, kid, the grownups will take it from here.
But not this time
This is our time
This time, you're gonna hand them a business card that says,  "I'm CEO, bitch.
That's what I want for you
So where the hell is Eduardo
He's in New York
Sucking up to ad execs
He's got an...  An internship
The company's here
A billiondollar company's here
Do you live and breathe Facebook
Yes
I know you do
Wardo wants to be a businessman and for all I know he's gonna be a good one,  but he shouldn't be in New York kissing Madison Avenue's ass
This is a onceinageneration, "holy shit" idea
And the water under the Golden Gate is freezing cold
Look at my face and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about
Do you ever think about that girl
What girl
The girl from high school with the lacrosse thing
No
If you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth, we need shots
A hundred schools by the end of the summer
Yeah
Tell you what
Gesture of good faith
While you're getting into 100 schools, I'll put you on two continents
Two..
If you don't have a place to crash,  I think you should definitely come and live with us
Let's line up some shots
Excuse me
Yes, sir
You can take this away and bring back the 1942
Absolutely, Mr. Parker
Attention... Go
At the barrier, Hollandia is leading Harvard University by one length
Approaching the grandstands,  Hollandia maintains a lead of threequarters of a length
Come on
Whatever
Mr. Winklevoss
Tyler
Tremendous race
Thank you
And this is my brother, Cameron
Excellent
Sir
His Royal Highness Prince Albert
Your Highness, this is Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss
Of course
Brilliant race
I've never seen a race that close
Yes, Your Highness
My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of the premier rowers of his day
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years and I'd never seen a race that close
Have you
Have you seen a race that close
No, Your Highness
Mileandahalf races are more commonly won by a boat length or two
Yes, that's absolutely right
Brutally close
May I introduce my teammates
I'm sorry
You'll have to excuse us
On to the Dutch
Sorry you flew all the way out here to see that
Wouldn't have missed it, brother
How was the royalty
I just wanted him to tell me a couple more times how close the race was
Just brutal, brutally close
Brutally excruciating
Jesus
The guy is the prince of a country the size of Nantucket
Relax, it's fine
Boys
Divya
Dad
Mr. Winklevoss
That was a tough beat
I'm sorry that you and Mom had to fly out here to see that
No, don't ever apologize to me for losing a race like that
Don't ever apologize to anyone for losing a race like that
Boys
Mr. Kenwright
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright, head of the host family for this week
Pleasure to meet you
Good to meet you
I've just had a phone chat with my daughter
She told me that she and her friends are already talking about the race,  which they've just seen via their computers
A new website called Facebook
Do you have this in America
I'm gonna find your mother
Have I said something wrong
Your daughter doesn't go to school in the States
No, no
Cambridge
Majoring in French literature, though I wasn't aware there was such a thing
And they have Facebook at Cambridge
And apparently Oxford and the London School of Economics
That's where her friends are
That's awesome
Good race, boys
Take the bitter with the better, eh
I'm gonna go watch the race film
If this is online, I wanna see it
Stop it
Stop it, Cam
Knock it off
I don't mind that we lost to the Dutch today by less than a second
That was a good race, and that was a fair race
And they'll see us again
What I mind, and what you should mind,  is showing up on Monday for a race that was run on Sunday
We tried talking to him ourselves, we tried writing a letter,  we tried the Ad Board, and we tried talking to the president of the university
Now, I am asking you for the last time,  let's take the considerable resources at our disposal and sue him in federal court
Come on
I need a real drink
Screw it
Let's gut the frigging nerd
That's what I'm talking about
No, no, no, no, no
But check it out, I saw him today
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham, my Case Equity guy
Hang on
Are you guys using Spikes or Ghost Missiles
We don't know, we're just shooting at each other
Use Sweet Kamikazes
Like we know what that is
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera and he saw me, too
I know he did
Don't
Don't sweat it
I'm on a landline
Bong hit
Does anybody hear that banging
You don't hear anything
You're writing code
Dude, somebody's at the door
It's not a dish best served cold
It's best served immediately and relentlessly
I'm gonna call you back
What's up
Mark was supposed to pick me up at the airport an hour ago
I've been calling his cell
He was on a 36hour coding tear, so he took a nap for a couple of hours
What happened here
Not happened
Happening
The next big thing
Wardo
Hey, man
Back to work
Okay
The more bad I get at this, the more wasted I get
I mean the more wasted that I get...  We understand
How old are they, Sean
It's not polite to ask
Sean, how old are they
You think you know me, right
I've read enough
You know how much I've read about you
Nothing
Wardo
Hey, man
I waited an hour for you at the airport
What time is it
It's midnight
Or 3:00 a.m
In New York, where I just came from
You gotta see some of the new stuff we got
Hey, Dustin
Show him the Wall
I'm just calling it the Wall
Forget the Wall, tell him about the meeting I've got set up
You know Peter Thiel
Nope
No reason you should
He just runs a $2billion hedge fund called Clarium Capital
Why's he setting up meetings
Thiel might wanna make an angel investment
I don't care if he's an actual angel
Why is he setting up business meetings
You've had a long flight
No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,  then a long wait at the passenger loading and unloading zone at SFO,  and in between there was a long flight
I'm the business end of this company
And he is a houseguest living here rent free  on a very generous grant from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation
I heard about your bigticket ad buys
Gary's Tuxedos
Hey, man...  Harvard Bartending Course
You're just a small step away from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it
You wanna talk to me alone for a minute
Sure
Bong hit
I'm so high
No, you're not
So how's it going
How's the internship
How's Christy
How's the internship
Yeah
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship
We talked about this on the phone
I quit on my first day
I do remember you saying that
So how is Christy
Christy's crazy
Is that fun
No
I mean, she's actually psychotic
She's insanely jealous, she's irrational, and I'm frightened of her
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend
I do not want that guy representing himself as part of this company
You gotta move out here, Wardo, this is where it's all happening
Did you hear what I just said
The connections, the energy...  Mark, you got..
I'm afraid if you don't come out here, you're gonna get left behind
I want..
I need you out here
Please don't tell him I said that
What did you just say
It's moving faster than any of us ever imagined it would
It's moving fast
What did you mean
And Sean thinks we have...  Sean is not part of this company
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,  and we're in 160 schools, including five in Europe
I'm aware of that
Mark, I am the CFO
We need more servers than I ever expected we'd need
We need more programmers and we need more money,  and he set up the Thiel meeting
He set up meetings all over town
He set up other meetings
Yes
Without me knowing anything about it
You're in New York
I'm in New York riding subways 14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers
And how's it going so far
What did you mean, "get left behind"
Hi
Can I help you
I'd like to freeze this bank account  and cancel all existing checks and lines of credit
May I see some ID, please
Yeah, sure, sorry
Sean, he'll be right with you
No problem
You know this is where they filmed Towering Inferno
That's comforting
Hey, guys
Come on back
She offer you some waters
Oh, yeah
We're cool
Sean, how are you
Come on in
You must be Mark
Hi
We took a look at everything, and congratulations
We're gonna start you off with a $500,000 investment
Maurice is gonna talk to you about some corporate restructuring
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware  and come up with a stock structure that allows for new investors
Now, let me ask you something
Who's Eduardo Saverin
Jesus Christ
When did you get back
You scared me
I need you to knock
When did you get back
I got back this afternoon
And when were you gonna call me
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip and I was tired...  Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts
Did you know I sent 47 texts
I did, and I thought that was incredibly normal behavior
Are you mocking me
I brought you a present
Why does your Status say "single" on your Facebook page
What
Why does your Relationship Status say "single" on your Facebook page
Well, I was single when I set up the page
And you just never bothered to change it
What
I don't know how
Do I look stupid to you
No, calm down
You're asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook  doesn't know how to change his Relationship Status on Facebook
It's embarrassing, so you should take it as a sign of trust that I would tell you that
Go to hell
Take it easy
No, you didn't change it so you could screw those Silicon Valley sluts  every time you go out to see Mark
Not even remotely true, and I can promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts  don't care what anyone's Relationship Status is on Facebook
Please, open your present
Your phone does work
It's Mark
Okay, this is gonna be tricky
Open your present
It's a silk scarf
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf
This'll be your first
Yeah
You froze our account
I did
You froze the account
I had to get your attention, Mark
Do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company
Do you realize that your actions could have destroyed  everything I've been working on
We have been working on
Without money, the site can't function
Let me tell you the difference between Facebook and everybody else
We don't crash ever
If the servers are down for even a day, our entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed
Look...  Users are fickle
Friendster has proved that
Even a few people leaving would reverberate through the entire user base
The users are interconnected
That is the whole point
College kids are online because their friends are online  and if one domino goes, the other dominos go
Don't you get that
I am not going back to the Caribbean Night at AEPi
Holy shit
What is wrong with you
Did you like being nobody
Did you like being a joke
Do you wanna go back to that
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on
That was the act of a child, not a businessman,  and it certainly was not the act of a friend
You know how embarrassing it was for me to try to cash a check today
I am not going back to that life
Maybe you were frustrated
Yeah
Maybe you were angry
I was
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,  because, Wardo, I've got some good news
I'm sorry
I was angry, and maybe it was childish, but I had to get your attention
Wardo, I said I've got some good news
What is it
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment of half a million dollars
What
Half a million dollars
And he's setting us up in an office
They wanna reincorporate the company
They wanna meet you
They need your signature on some documents,  so you gotta get your ass on the first flight back to San Francisco
I need my CFO
I'm on my way
Wardo
Yeah
We did it
Wardo
You're going back there already
Yes
And also, I'm breaking up with you
Somebody stop her
Four documents
The first two are common stock purchase agreements,  allowing you to buy stock in the newly reincorporated Facebook,  as opposed to the old shares, which are now worthless
The third is an exchange agreement  allowing you to exchange the old shares for new shares,  and then finally a voter holding agreement
How many shares of stock will I own
1,328,334
Jesus Christ
That represents a 34.4% ownership share
Why the increase from the original 30%
'Cause you may need to dilute it to award shares to new investors
I love working with business majors
I'm telling you
Economics
Right
You should know that Mark has already taken his percentage from 60 down to 51
Well, Mark doesn't care about money and he needs to be protected
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%
Sean Parker, 6.47%
I can live with that
And Peter Thiel, 7%
Would you like to use my pen
Eduardo
Eduardo
Can you please repeat the question
No, it was an outrageously leading question the first time around,  and now you want us to hear it twice
Yes
Would you read it back, please
Well, go ahead
"Counsel: 'And when you signed these documents,  "'were you aware that you were signing your own death certificate?"
No
It was insanely stupid of me not to have my own lawyers look over all the..
In all honesty, I thought they were my lawyers
I was your only friend
You had one friend
My father won't even look at me
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say anything to you after you signed the papers
There was a lot of handshaking, a lot of congratulations
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be  coming back to school for at least a semester,  so we were saying goodbye for a while
And then before I left he said..
But you gotta come back
Somewhere around the end of November or early December
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party when we hit a million members
It's gonna be out of control
You gotta come back for it
A million members
Yeah
Remember the algorithm on the window at Kirkland
Yeah
Yeah, I'll be here
You sure about this
You're 20 minutes late
You're gonna walk in there and say you overslept  and didn't have time to get dressed
They're gonna pitch you
Case Equity is going to pitch you
They're gonna beg you to take their money
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod, you're gonna nod,  and then you're gonna say, "Which one of you is Roth?
No, not Roth
Manningham
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?
And he'll say, "I am.
And then you say, "Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you."
Walk out
Okay
In late November, I got the email from Mark  telling me to come out for the millionthmember party
What else did the email say
It said that we had to have a business meeting
That Mark and Sean had played some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,  and that Manningham was so impressed  that he was now making an investment offer that was hard to turn down
So I went to California, and I went straight to the new offices
I didn't know whether to dress for the party or for the business meeting,  so I kind of dressed for both
But it didn't matter
Why not
Because I wasn't called out there for either one
What were you called out there for
An ambush
Mr. Saverin
Hey
Right over here
Hey, man
How are you
Good
How are you
Good, good, good, good, good
Good to see you
At first I thought he was joking
Giving me more contracts to sign
But then I started reading
Wait, what is this
Well, as you know, we had some new investors that have come in
What is this
Mr. Saverin
Mark
Mark
He's wired in
Sorry
He's wired in
Is he
Yes
How about now
Are you still wired in
Call security
You issued 24 million new shares of stock
You were told that if new investors came along...  How much were your shares diluted
How much were his
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership share diluted down to
It wasn't
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share diluted down to
It wasn't
What was Sean Parker's ownership share diluted down to
It wasn't
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share diluted down to
It wasn't
And what was your ownership share diluted down to
.03%   You signed the papers
You set me up
You're gonna blame me because you were the business head of the company,  and you made a bad business deal with your own company
It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook
It won't be like you're not a part of Facebook
You're not a part of Facebook
My name's on the masthead
You might wanna check again
This because I froze the account
You think we'd let you parade around in your ridiculous suits,  pretending you were running this company
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's
Along with my hoodie and my fuckyou flipflops, you pretentious douchebag
Security's here
You'll be leaving now
I'm not signing those papers
We will get the signature
Tell me this isn't about me getting into the Phoenix
You... You did it
I knew you did it
You planted that story about the chicken
I didn't plant that story
What's he talking about
You had me accused of animal cruelty
Seriously
What the hell's the chicken
And I'll bet what you hated the most  is that they identified me as a cofounder of Facebook
Which I am
You better lawyer up, asshole
'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%
I'm coming back for everything
Get him out of here
It's okay, I'm going
Hang on
Almost forgot
Here's your $19,000
I wouldn't cash it, though
I drew it on the account you froze
I like standing next to you, Sean
It makes me look so tough
Well...  That's it, that's our show for tonight, people
And look, I wanna see everyone here geared up for a party
We're gonna walk into that club like it's the Macy's Parade
Mackey, put it up on the big screen
We've gotta almost be there
You all right
Yeah
You were kind of rough on him
That's life in the NFL
You know you didn't have to be that rough on him
Listen, I put him...  Sean
You didn't have to be that rough on him
He almost killed it
I'll send flowers
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma
Ashleigh's a sister
Ashleigh
The intern
Yeah
I know who she is
Are you guys...  Ashleigh
Me
No
Well, a little bit
Why
No
Nothing, I just..
Excuse me
Mark
We were just talking about you
Just that you're doing a really good job
Thanks
I appreciate that
These came in for you
Put them on my desk
What's the package
Nothing
Mackey
Yes, sir
Refresh
Sweet
And you're not a hugger
I know
One million
Who's got champagne
Huh
I've got champagne
The next transformative development, a picturesharing application
A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life
It is the true digitalization of real life
You can use a CD
You can do it off of me
You don't just go to a party anymore
You go to a party with a digital camera, and then your friends relive the party online
And tagging
The idea...   Would this be easier without the bra
It's worth finding out
All right, shut the music down
The party's over
Everybody, go home
I've spent hours watching what people do when they log on
How they check their friends' status updates
Wait
That's weird
Why did the music stop
Check to see which one of their friends  changed their profiles, changed their photos..
Seriously, what happened to the music
We lived on farms and then we lived in cities,  and now we're going to live on the Internet
Sean, stop
I think something's going on downstairs
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please
It's time for you to go home
The party is over
Then it's all good
It's the cops
What
Shit
Shit
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit
Okay, it's okay
Be cool
Good to see you, Officer
What can I do for you
What's going on
Was the music too loud
We were having a celebration
Miss, I need you to button your blouse
I can tell them to turn the music down
That's not mine
Okay, we're gonna need identification
Keep your hands where we can see them
Oh, my God
You got anything else in your pockets I should know about
No, sir
No
Don't be stupid, now
I don't, I don't
What's this
That's an EpiPen
And this
That's my inhaler
How old are you
Twentyone
Twentyone
I'm 21
Lying only makes it worse
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied
Hello
Listen, something's happened
Shit
No, it's all right
It's gonna be all right
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything
I mean, I've got allergies
Interns
It was just a party
This is gonna be news, Sean
It's gonna be online any second
I know
You know with an intern...  No, it's cool
I have it under control
I will get it under control
I will call someone and see what the next move is
But this is gonna be news now
You don't think Wardo was involved, do you
I mean, do you think...  No
Or Manningham
One of them
Somebody
Somebody sent the coke in there, because it got in there
You believe me
God, this is gonna be fine
Right
Go home, Sean
Mark
Mark
We're done for the day
Yeah
Yeah, I was just sitting here
What happened to Sean
He still owns 7% of the company
All you had all day was that salad
Do you wanna get something to eat
I can't
I'm not a bad guy
I know that
When there's emotional testimony, I assume 85% of it is exaggeration
And the other 15
Perjury
Creation myths need a devil
What happens now
Sy and the others are having a steak on University Avenue
Then they'll come back up to the office,  and start working on a settlement agreement to present to you
They're gonna settle
Oh, yeah
And you're gonna have to pay a little extra
Why
So that these guys sign a nondisclosure agreement
They say one unflattering word about you in public, you own their wife and kids
I invented Facebook
I'm talking about a jury
I specialize in voir dire, jury selection
What a jury sees when they look at a defendant
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...  Likeability
I've been licensed to practice law for all of 20 months,  and I could get a jury to believe  that you planted the story about Eduardo and the chicken
Watch what else
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party that night
You think I'm the one that called the police
Doesn't matter
I asked the question, now everybody's thinking about it
You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes
Farm animals
Yeah
I was drunk and angry and stupid
And blogging...  And blogging
Pay them
In the scheme of things,  it's a speeding ticket
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed and used the computer for a minute
I can't imagine it would be a problem
Thanks
I appreciate your help today
You're not an asshole, Mark
You're just trying so hard to be
 Baby, your a rich man  "Baby, You're A Rich Man by The BEATLES"  Where have you been
I've been waiting since 7:00
Get in
I had to find fireworks
Let me drive
Get in
I haven't eaten in 24 hours
Are you coming or not
It's too crowded
I thought you were starving
Let's go someplace quiet
Okay
What are we doing
Sitting
Listening to music
Talking
<i> You seem weird
Is everything okay
Yeah, everything's fine.</i>  It's July
How many shirts are you wearing
I'm cold
You're cold on the Fourth of July
Fuck off and die
What
"Fuck off and die"
Shut up
Was that car at the drivein
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's
Do you want me to tell him to leave
Stay in the car
Was that your husband
No
<i>Who was that, Darlene?</i>  Don't worry about it
Don't tell me not to worry
Who was it
It's nothing
<i>Oh, shit.</i>  Let's go

Why
It was minty
You can't do that
It's not good for you

Why am I not going on the bus
Because we're late

That's a crime
Have you seen her
Wouldn't kid you
It may be the beginning of a crime wave
You need to see this
Go get the publisher
<i>"Dear Editor,</i>  "This is the murderer  "of the two teenagers last Christmas at Lake Herman  "and the girl on the Fourth of July near the golf course in Vallejo
<i>"To prove I killed them,</i>  "I shall state some facts which only I and the police know
<i>"Christmas, brand name of ammo, SuperX.</i>  "Ten shots were fired
"The boy was on his back with his feet to the car
"The girl... "  <i>Would you read that, please?</i>  <i>"The girl was on her right side, feet to the west.</i>  "Fourth of July
<i>"One, girl was wearing patterned slacks.</i>  "The boy was also shot in the knee

He wants his code in the afternoon edition
<i>If the Examiner doesn't have the balls to run it, we scoop the Bay.</i>  <i>Al, this man is talking about shooting 12 people.</i>  And not running this might make him do that
<i>If we run it, we might be setting a very dangerous precedent.</i>  <i>Oh, come on, now, it's newsworthy.</i>  <i>Well, giving some sick bastard a soapbox,</i>  what does that say to people
Back up
Is this Vallejo story true
Do we know that

I cover crime in Vallejo
<i>Yeah, I cover crime in Vallejo

Thank you
Sergeant Mulanax
<i>Sergeant, Paul Avery from the San Francisco Chronicle.</i>  I just wanted to check  if you had an unsolved firearmrelated homicide  on Christmas and maybe one on July fourth
Shit
<i>You guys got one, too?</i>  <i>Confirmed
VPD, they confirmed the shootings.</i>  <i>Al's on the phone with the Examiner.</i>  They got the same letter with a different code

<i> Paul
Yes, Templeton.</i>  <i> Editorial, now
Very well.</i>  Another letter
More of the same
Details about the murders
He taped a flashlight to the gun
That's how he hit them in the dark
And he gave himself a name
You know this used to be the town of Montecello
<i>But at some point,</i>  the county decided that the land would work better as a lake
So they flooded it
But there's an entire...  Hidden city under the water
<i>We were here last spring, remember?</i>  <i>Oh, yeah.</i>  Somebody else is here
It is a public park
I think he's watching us
<i>Well, we're very goodlooking.</i>  Where'd he go
He went behind that tree
All right
So he's taking a leak
He's coming towards us
<i>Oh, my God, he has a gun.</i>  Don't move
I want your money and your car keys
Okay
<i>We're not gonna do anything, okay?</i>  We're gonna cooperate
Just tell me what you want us to do
Here
You're welcome to everything I have
If there's anything else I could do for you...  Maybe I could write you a check
<i>Okay, I could give you my phone number.</i>  <i>You know, I might be able to help you.</i>  Even more than you might think
He's a sociology major
<i>Prelaw, actually.</i>  <i>Oh, keys.</i>  <i>You know, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly where I put my keys.</i>  They might be on the blanket
Is it okay if..
Here's the keys
Don't get up
I want her to tie you up
Okay
<i>You know, if he comes any closer, I might be able to get that gun.</i>   Don't get any ideas
I'm not
I killed a guard escaping from prison in Montana
<i>I'm not doing anything, okay?</i>  I'm not afraid to kill again
Look away
What was the name of that prison
<i>Hey, you said it was in Montana, right?</i>  I'm taking your car
I'm going to Mexico
We didn't complain when you tied our hands
<i>Okay, you have everything that I have.</i>  We have done everything that you've asked
It's okay
It's okay
<i>She tied you loose, didn't she?</i>  Get on your stomach so I can tie your feet
Okay
It gets really cold out here at night
We could freeze

It's okay
This is all gonna be okay

What's the story with the kid
He seems a little touched or medicated or...  <i> Graysmith
Yeah, what is it?</i>  He's a fucking boy scout
<i>He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink, he doesn't curse.</i>   And he's back

<i> What do you mean, like teriyaki
No, like the urchin.</i>  <i> Raw fish
I'm eating here, Bill.</i>  <i> I always wanted to try it
So, why don't you?</i>  Haven't got around to it
<i>Evening, gents
What a lovely night for a botched robbery.</i>  <i>Yeah, third this week
Must be end of summer rush.</i>  <i>I got foot patrols going through the park, dogs are on the way.</i>  The victim's name is Paul Stine
Dousette pronounced him at 10:10
Suspect fired one shot to the back of the head
Driver's wallet and car keys are missing
How'd you know his name
<i>Leroy, there, came down from Yellow Cab to ID him.</i>  <i>Neighborhood's pretty highend for this kind of thing,</i>  so I already set up transpo for the cab
Coroner's here
Any witnesses
Kids who called it in saw the suspect from that window
Did they hear a shot
No
<i>They first saw him in the front seat,</i>  thought he was a drunk fighting with the driver
<i>Oldest kid ran downstairs to get a better look from the dining room,</i>  <i>described him as a white male, glasses,</i>  <i>crewcut, stocky, and wearing a dark jacket.</i>  <i>Wait, I thought someone said he was black.</i>  That's the description that went out to radio cars
<i> We already corrected it
Oh, well, that's good.</i>   You guys need anything else
No
Get out of here
Thanks
Happy Birthday
<i> Wait, it's your birthday
Yep.</i>   That's great
Happy birthday
Thanks
<i> Body or scene
It's your birthday, I'll take the body.</i>  <i>Dave, looks like he wiped the cab down pretty good.</i>   We got some blood over here
Prints
Could very well be
We'll dust it at the Hall
<i>The odd thing is, we also got gloves.</i>   Suspect's
There's blood on them
<i> Hey, Pete
Yeah, Dave.</i>  <i>You through over there, can I get in there?</i>  <i>Yeah, I'm all set.</i>   Who rolled him
Stewarts
I got a single 9mm casing
<i>Yeah, Luger.</i>  Nothing from the crowd
<i>Okay
I'm your shooter, Negro male adult,</i>  <i>who also happens to be a stocky, crewcut Caucasian.</i>  I flag a cab
I give him this address
Did I give him this address
Who's got the fare book
Right here
Washington and Maple
That's one block east
<i>Lighting's the same over here,</i>  so maybe I see someone walking their dog
You don't want any witnesses so you tell him to go down a block
He pulls over
I wait for him to put it in park because I'm smart  and I don't want him hitting the accelerator  when I shoot him
May I
<i>He stops, puts it in park, boom.</i>  <i>I shoot him on the right side, he slumps right?</i>  Maybe you've got your hand on his collar when you shoot
<i>All right
So, either way,</i>  I just dumped a quart of blood in the front seat
<i> So, why do you get in the front seat
For the money.</i>  But he's dead
<i>You could just reach over the seat, pull out his wallet.</i>  You don't have to go anywhere near the blood
<i>So, why'd he get in the front seat?</i>   I'm an idiot
But you're not an idiot
You waited for him to put it in park
<i> Right
Thank you
Yeah, sure.</i>   Can I see that
Yeah
I am an idiot
I just killed a man for $8.25
It's his third fare of the night
Does anyone have any animal crackers
Animal crackers
They're in the car
I'm saving those for later
Fine
<i> Are you a reporter
No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, SFPD.</i>  <i>Sir, I was wondering if I'd be able to talk to your children,</i>  one at a time and preferably alone
They just saw a man murdered
I understand
It looked like they were drunk and fighting
<i>Yeah, and he had a rag.</i>  He came around the side of the car and he was wiping stuff
Did you get a chance to see his face
I did
<i>Well, sort of.</i>  Did you remember what he looked like
Normal
Yeah
"Normal?
<i>"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  <i>"I am the murderer of the taxi driver</i>  "over by Washington Street and Maple Street last night
<i>"To prove this, here is a bloodstained piece of his shirt.</i>  "I am the same man who did in the people in the North Bay Area
"The S.F
Police could have caught me last night  "if they had searched the park properly  "instead of holding road races with their motorcicles. 
Gentlemen
Dave
Paul
Where's the shirt
<i>Right there, boss.</i>  There's your rag the kids talked about
So he got in the front seat to tear off a piece of the shirt
<i> Is this on the record
Well, what do you think?</i>  He confirms the Vallejo and Napa killings
Gets worse
<i>Robert, do you have a deadline?</i>  <i>What does he mean, it gets worse?</i>  Read the last part
"School children make nice targets
"I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning
"Just shoot out the front tire  "and then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out. 
<i>Jesus Christ, who's got school buses
Department of Transportation?</i>   School board
All right
I'm gonna need elimination prints from your staff
Has anyone here didn't touch this letter
<i>On my way back to my desk
They have phones, if you want.</i>  We need to get matches on blood and fabric
<i>I'll call Napa and Vallejo,</i>  get the letters up to Sherwood in Sacramento
<i>Dave, just one thing
Is it true they got a print off the cab?</i>  <i>Yeah, we got a partial in blood.</i>  <i> But that is not for publication
Hey, hey, come on.</i>  <i>Hey, it's me.</i>  Did he say they got a print
Partial
Whoa
<i>Dude, he wears his gun like Bullitt.</i>  <i>No, McQueen got that from Toschi.</i>  Does he think that Zodiac's gonna send another code
'Cause I think Zodiac's gonna send another code
<i>Jesus Harold Christ on rubber crutches, Bobby.</i>  What are you doing
<i>You're doing that thing, the thing we discussed,</i>  the thing that I don't like
Starts with an "L."  <i> Oh, looming
Yeah.</i>  <i>In cooperation with SFPD, we will run the Zodiac letter</i>  without including the threat on school children
We don't want to start a citywide panic  so I'm asking all of you to please keep this confidential
Just go about your daily business
Thank you
<i>I packed you your carrots and your soda and peanut butter, okay?</i>  <i> Dad, you don't have to wait with me
I know.</i>  <i>You know what
You know what
I'm gonna drive him today, okay?</i>  Come on
What's that
Similarities in the lowercase "r's. 
And that
It is you waiting in the hall if you speak again
I have to concentrate
Sorry
"Sorry" counts as speaking
There are similarities in the lowercase "r's. 
We have to release the bus threat
It'll screw us
We're already screwed
We just went from "Routine Cabbie Shooting"  to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids. 
<i>The Zodiac Killer has come to San Francisco.</i>  <i>Confirmation tonight,</i>  <i>from the San Francisco Police Department</i>  <i>that in his latest haunting letter,</i>  <i>which takes credit for the murder of cab driver Paul Stine,</i>  <i>the Zodiac has threatened to, "Wipe out a school bus</i>  <i>"and pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out
"</i>  <i>If you think you might know who the Zodiac is,</i>  <i>you can call the San Francisco Police Department's newest tip line.</i>  Press conference is at 4:00
We got to give them something
<i>We're coordinating with the school board,</i>  and we expect a break in the case very soon
What do we really got
We're swamped
When they can't get anyone on the tip line  they call the switchboard and keep getting put through
You got any hard suspects
About 90 an hour
I'm up to around 500
<i>Well, can't you narrow it down?</i>  <i>I would love to, if I could get out of this...</i>  <i> Homicide, please hold
Yeah, hold, please.</i>  We're gonna need to tell them we got the entire force on this
How many men can you give me
<i>Well, right now, it's you and Bill and Monday's a school day.</i>  <i>Yeah, I know, Chief
I have three daughters of my own.</i>  <i>Yeah, I know
Where's Armstrong?</i>  He's on the phone with Vallejo
<i>We're playing catch up, Jack.</i>  <i>I'd like to set up a meeting with your survivor, Michael Mageau.</i>  I can't
He skipped town
The only guy who's seen Zodiac without a mask is missing
When he was still in the hospital we could show him lineups all day long
<i>As soon as he got out, he split.</i>  <i>Really
Why?</i>  I don't think he wanted to have anything to do with this
<i>Can you send us everything that you have?</i>  <i>Well, the road goes both ways.</i>  <i>Now, we need that print you lifted from the cab</i>  <i>and we should have been in on the handwriting.</i>  I apologize
Things have been moving fast
<i>Who should I talk to in Napa so we can coordinate?</i>  Talk to Ken Narlow
We really should have been in on the handwriting
<i>I apologize
Things have been moving fast.</i>  <i>Listen, we're gonna need your scene photos.</i>  Can't help you
<i>Ken, I don't want to get into a jurisdictional thing here.</i>  <i>No, no, no, no, no
We didn't have a crime scene.</i>  The ranger that found the kids literally swept everything into a picnic blanket
<i>All we have are the Wing Walker prints.</i>  The what
Boot prints to and from the crime scene  <i>were made by size 10andahalf Wing Walkers,</i>  militarystyle boots sold only at military PXs  designed to walk on the wings of planes
<i>And you can't buy at a PX without a military ID,</i>  so our suspect could be military
Did you guys narrow your list off of this
<i> Yeah
Did Vallejo?</i>  I don't know
I don't work in Vallejo
I work here
Great
I'm gonna need photos of those boot prints
<i>Sure, if you send me the handwriting.</i>  I thought Questioned Documents already did
<i>Nope
Vallejo's got them, not us.</i>  All right
I'll have Questioned Documents..
Forget it
I'll telefax it to you
We don't have telefax yet
<i> Okay, I'll put it in the mail
We'll mail ours, too.</i>  And call Mulanax in Vallejo
Maybe he can get you a mimeo
Right
Why don't you just get a photo off the original plaster cast
<i>We'd have to wait, because they don't have a fax.</i>  <i>We don't have a fax, either.</i>  <i>Look, I'm just trying to get us coordinated.</i>  Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office
Why would I call Solano
<i>Because the two kids that got killed last Christmas were Solano's.</i>  I thought they were Vallejo
<i>No, they were over the county line</i>  <i>so you're gonna need to coordinate with them, too.</i>  Okay
Bill
Can I have a word with you
Where did you see this guy
We got the call to circle the scene and look for a Negro male adult
Where was he
On Jackson
Heading east
About the middle of the block
And this is three minutes after the shooting
And this is three minutes after the shooting
Give or take
Yeah
And you were heading east or west
We were going west
<i>All right, so you're on Jackson going west.</i>  So the cab was one block cattycorner southwest
Correct
Did you slow down
Of course we slowed down
All right
<i>Listen, Dispatch said it was a Negro male.</i>  That was corrected
<i>No, but at the time they hadn't changed it.</i>  This guy was white
<i>Right, not in a hurry
Kind of lumbering along like...</i>  <i>Lumbering
What do you mean, "lumbering"?</i>   Shuffling
Stocky
Had a crew cut
<i>Yeah, that's all correct.</i>  <i>Listen, it was dark.</i>  The guy was wearing a dark jacket
There's no way..
He would have been covered in blood
Did you stop him
Did you talk to him
Yes
No
No
You need to get with a sketch artist
We have to put out a new composite right away
<i>Five persons have been murdered in the San Francisco area,</i>  <i>and in each case the killer...</i>  <i>"I shall wipe out a school bus some morning... "</i>  <i>San Francisco police...</i>  <i>...to see the Stones in concert this Sunday.</i>  <i>The new letters from the Zodiac Killer were sent to</i>  <i>the City room of the San Francisco Chronicle.</i>  <i>One of the letters was...</i>  Looming
No looming
Have you considered the water theory
What
<i>Geographically, every attack takes place near a body of water</i>   or a waterbased name
This is your water theory
Lake Berryessa
Blue Rock Springs
Lake Herman
Washington and Cherry
You think
No
<i>I'm reading this book,</i>  <i>Homicide Investigation by Lemoyne Snyder...</i>  <i> "Leymone. 
... and he says you look for patterns,</i>   so I'm looking for patterns
No
You can't think of this case in normal police terms
Why not
You got four crime scenes
<i>Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa, and here.</i>  Not a single usable print at the first three or in any of the letters
How does our master criminal come to the city and leave a bloody latent
<i>I mean, assuming the gloves are his,</i>  he shoots the cabbie and then takes them off
<i>So it's not his print?</i>  <i>Maybe, maybe not
You're missing the point.</i>   The point is the first attack...  David Faraday and Betty Jensen
They both die
<i>From there on out, he only manages to kill the girls.</i>   Not for lack of trying
Not for lack of trying
<i>Mageau lives, Ferrin dies
Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.</i>  He gets so caught up with the women he forgets to finish off the men
<i>Plus, they're all couples and all on lover's lanes.</i>   Paul Stine is not
Exactly
<i>Single, male cab driver on Washington and Cherry doesn't fit.</i>  Doesn't fit
<i>So, why does Zodiac kill him?</i>  He's breaking the pattern
Yeah
<i>Someone claiming to be Zodiac called Oakland PD a halfhour ago.</i>  <i>He says he's gonna call in on Jim Dunbar's morning show in three hours.</i>  On television
<i>He wants Melvin Belli on to counsel him.</i>  All right
All right
Let's go wake up Melvin
Animal crackers
Glove box
Are these windows bulletproof
<i>Yes, Melvin
You don't have to lie down back there.</i>  <i>This man is a marksman,</i>  could snuff me out at a moment's notice
Are you sure you're up for this
<i>Don't you worry about me, Inspector
I'll be fine when the lights are on.</i>  This man has asked for my help
The man you're worrying about snuffing you out
<i>What are these, cookies?</i>  <i>Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?</i>   Shit
KGO must have tipped other stations
<i>Get him talking
Convince him to meet you somewhere.</i>  <i>If you see an opportunity,</i>  we want you to suggest Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown
You'll be tracing the call
Pacific Telephone says you need to keep him on the line for 15 minutes
<i>We can do that, can't we, Jim?</i>  Fifteen seconds
Clear the set
<i>Here you go, you drunken reprobate.</i>  <i>We interrupt our regular program to bring you this news bulletin.</i>  <i>Welcome to this special edition of our show</i>  <i>in which we are joined by attorney Melvin Belli</i>  <i>who the Zodiac Killer personally requested to appear.</i>  <i>Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.</i>  <i> Good morning, Melvin
Good morning, Jim.</i>  <i>So, the phone lines are open
Mr. Belli is here.</i>  <i>Here to help, Jim.</i>  <i>Yes
Here to help.</i>  <i>And we ask the public not to call in, so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.</i>  <i>I saw your Star Trek, by the way
It was excellent.</i>  A shame about the show
Good people
<i>You know, I've often thought of becoming an actor fulltime.</i>  What was your character's name
<i> Gorgon
Gorgon
That's right.</i>  Roll the tape
Get the tape
<i>Jim, we have a call
We're going live.</i>  Hello
Hello
This is Melvin Belli
Who am I speaking with
<i>This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  Is there something I can call you that's a little less ominous
<i>Sam.</i>  Sam
<i>Is there somewhere we can meet, Sam, and talk about this?</i>  <i>Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel.</i>  <i>Without anyone else or I'll jump...</i>  Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel
<i> Sam
Yes?</i>  Do you think you need medical care
<i>Medical, not mental.</i>  Do you have health problems
<i>I'm sick
I have headaches.</i>  Headaches
<i>I have headaches, too,</i>  but a chiropractor stopped them a week ago
<i>I think I can help you, Sam.</i>  Sam
He knows they're tracing his calls
<i>Sam, we'd like you to know that we are not tracing these calls.</i>  <i>It's a long, difficult process and ineffective with these short calls.</i>  Sam
We're not tracing these calls
You have my word
<i>Okay.</i>  <i>Sam, you need to tell me what your problem is.</i>  <i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber.</i>  <i>I have headaches
I kill, I don't get them.</i>  That is fucked up
<i>You want to live, don't you
Well, this is your passport.</i>  <i>How long have you been having these headaches?</i>  <i>Since I killed a kid.</i>  <i> Do you have blackouts
Yes.</i>  <i> Do you have fits
No
I just have headaches.</i>  Did you attempt to call one other time  when F. Lee Bailey was with us two or three weeks ago
<i>Yes.</i>  And why did you want to talk to Mr. Bailey
<i>Why do you wanna talk to me, Sam?</i>  <i> I don't want to be hurt
Why is he calling?</i>  <i> Hey, just a second, buddy
I don't wanna go to the gas chamber.</i>  <i>You won't get hurt if you talk to me.</i>  And you're not going to the gas chamber
I wouldn't think they would ask for capital punishment
<i>We should ask the District Attorney.</i>  <i>Do you want me to do that, Sam?</i>  <i>Do you want me to talk to the District Attorney?</i>  <i>What was that, Sam?</i>  <i>I did not say anything.</i>  <i>We heard a scream.</i>  <i>That was my headache.</i>  You sound like you're in a great deal of pain
<i>My head aches
I'm so sick.</i>  <i>I'm gonna kill them.</i>  <i> Oh, okay
I'm gonna kill those kids!</i>  Fantastic
<i>Sam?</i>  <i> Let's meet and talk
Just us
Okay.</i>  <i>How about Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown?</i>  <i>No.</i>  <i>In front of the Daly City St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30.</i>  I'll see you there
<i>Take care of yourself, Sam.</i>  <i>My, my, my.</i>  You fellows certainly know how to put on a secret meeting
<i>You know, the problem is,</i>  <i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber
I have headaches.</i>  <i>I kill, I don't get them.</i>  <i>No, it's not him.</i>  It's the voice
The voice is too high
It's too young
<i>All right
Thanks for coming down, Bryan.</i>  <i>Do you have blackouts?</i>  That's okay
I got it
They pulled off the trace
Our Daly City noshow called from a mental institution
Oakland PD's operator is sure  the man she talked to had a deeper voice
Calmer
Might have actually been him
"So I shall change my way of collecting slaves
"I shall no longer announce to anyone when I commit my murders
<i>"They shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger</i>  <i>"and a few fake accidents, et cetera.</i>  "The police shall never catch me  "because I have been too clever for them
"I look like the description passed out only when I do my thing
"The rest of the time I look entirely different
"I shall not tell you what my disguise consists of when I kill
<i>"As of yet I have left no fingerprints behind me,</i>  "contrary to what the police say
"I wear transparent fingertips
"All it is is two coats of airplane cement coated on my fingertips
<i>"I enjoy needling the blue pigs
Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.</i>  "You were using fire trucks to mask the sound of your cruising prowl cars
<i>"Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up</i>  "to have your nose rubbed in your booboos
<i>"If you cops think I am going to take on a bus the way I stated I was,</i>  "you deserve to have holes in your heads. 
And you need to look at this
<i>"Take one bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer,</i>  <i>"one gallon of stove oil,</i>  "and dump a few bags of gravel on top... "   Okay
It's a bomb
Okay
We gotta call the Army and see if this  science experiment could actually work
Another cipher
When did these arrive
They arrived this morning
Are you planning to publish
Robert
We should have a drink
Thank you
<i>So, tell me about yourself.</i>   You married
Divorced
Two kids
What do you do for fun
I love to read
I enjoy books
Those are the same things
Why you been going through my trash
I'll come back to that
How did you know he was gonna send another code
I just guessed
Just guessed
The first one seemed too easy
<i>All right, this can no longer be ignored.</i>   What is that you're drinking
It's an Aqua Velva
You wouldn't make fun of it if you tried it
But who actually cracked the code
A married couple who like puzzles
So what's that tell us about the Zodiac
He's no expert
Right
It's just a simple substitution code  like the one that we used to do as boy scouts
<i>"A" is one, "B" is two.</i>  <i>We weren't all boy scouts, Robert.</i>  <i>Well, it's not that hard
You just got to know where to start.</i>  In the first cipher...  You actually carry that around with you
Why
No reason
What's the most common double consonant in the English language
Consonant
The double "L."  Double "L."  <i>And what's the one word that we know that he'll use in here, at least once?</i>  <i> "Kill. 
Right, "kill
"</i>  <i>So the Hardens start looking for double symbols,</i>  <i>which they find here, here, and here.</i>  Each with the same two symbols preceding them
So now they've got a repeating fourletter word  ending with two symbols that they assume stand for "L."  And since they think the whole word is "kill" then...  <i>Then you got your "K," you got your "I," and you're on your way.</i>  But how do you go from "A" is one and "B" is two  to figuring out this whole code
<i>Well, same way I did
You go to the library.</i>  <i>In this book,</i>  the author presents a very simple substitution code in the preface
Eight of the 26 symbols that he suggests are found in this cipher
<i>Yeah, but there are nonletter symbols</i>  because there's all these medieval ones
<i>I thought they looked medieval, too.</i>  But then I found a code written in the Middle Ages
Guess what it's called
The Zodiac Alphabet
Jesus
What do you want out of this
What
What's your angle
This is good business for everyone but you
How do you mean "business"
Hey
Come to bed
I'll be up in a minute
I need to make a phone call
<i> Hello
Bill?</i>  There's not many basements in California
<i>"Basement for future use
"</i>  That's right
<i>I'll have Vallejo and Napa check with their city planners.</i>  <i> Get some sleep
Yeah, sure.</i>  <i>"Dear Melvin, this is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  <i>"I wish you a happy Christmas.</i>  <i>"The one thing I ask of you is this
Please help me.</i>  "I cannot reach out for help because this thing in me won't let me. 
Thank you
"I am finding it extremely difficult to hold it in check  "and I am afraid I will lose control again  "and take my ninth and possibly tenth victim. 
<i>Melvin, he's reaching out to you.</i>  Absolutely
<i>Inspectors, he sent this letter directly to my residence.</i>  <i>It is a cry for help, intended as a private communiqu.</i>  <i>Which is why you contacted the Chronicle.</i>  The people have a right to know
Toddy
When did the letter arrive
In the middle of last week
I was away on safari
What did you gentlemen do for Christmas
You're looking at it
You must see Africa
Cradle of civilization
Fascinating people
Beautiful
Savage
Back to the killer who wrote to you
Yes
Of course
It is my belief that he only penned this letter  because he couldn't get through to me on the Dunbar show or here
He tried to contact you here
Several times
<i>I was out, but he spoke with my housekeeper.</i>  Didn't leave a number
He's kind of crafty like that
Do you mind if I speak to her
Not at all
But the real story is the letter
I'll be back
Yeah
She's right this way
<i>Inspector Toschi, it is my belief this is a window into this man's soul.</i>  Killing is his compulsion
<i>Even though he tries to ignore it, it drives him.</i>  It's in his blood
Could be
Or maybe he just likes the attention
<i>I didn't mean to scare you, but your right rear wheel is loose.</i>  Really
<i>If you like, I could tighten the lugs up for you.</i>  If you don't mind
<i>Well, you can't be too careful.</i>   All done
Thank you
No problem
Have a good night
It's okay
Are you okay
<i>Yeah
Yeah, we're fine.</i>  Must have been worse than I thought
I can give you a lift to a service station
Okay
It's okay
Come on
I didn't know you had a baby
<i>Oh, is that okay?</i>  The more the merrier
You shouldn't smoke
It's a bad habit
I think we just passed a filling station
It was closed
Do you always go around helping people in the night
<i>When I'm done with them, they don't need much help.</i>  It's okay
<i>Before I kill you,</i>  I'm gonna throw your baby out the window
No
Help
Please
No
She was on the side of the road
She flagged me down
What happened to her
She said she jumped from a car
I found her like this
<i> What is it
Please, he said...</i>   It'll be okay
Tried to kill me
My baby
Where's her baby
She didn't have one when I stopped
Where's your baby
Jesus
You hid it
In case he came back
<i>"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  <i>"By the way, have you cracked the last cipher I sent you?</i>  <i>"I'm mildly curious as to how much money you have on my head now.</i>  <i>"I hope you do not think I was the one who wiped out that blue meanie</i>  <i>"with a bomb at the cop station,</i>  <i>"even though I talked about killing children with one
"</i>  <i>"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  <i>"I'd like to see some nice Zodiac buttons wandering around town.</i>  <i>"Everyone else has these buttons</i>  <i>"like peace, black power, and Melvin eats blubber, et cetera.</i>  <i>"It would cheer me up considerably</i>  <i>"if I saw a lot of people wearing my button.</i>  <i> "Please no nasty ones. 
"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  <i>"I shot a man sitting in a parked car with a
38.</i>  <i>"Zodiac 12, SFPD zero
"</i>  <i>"The map coupled with this code will tell you where the bomb is set.</i>  <i>"You have until next fall to dig it up
"</i>  <i>"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  <i>"I'm rather unhappy because you people</i>  <i>"will not wear some nice Zodiac buttons.</i>  <i>"So, I now have a little list, starting with the woman and her baby</i>  "that I gave a rather interesting ride  <i>"for a couple of hours one evening, a few months back,</i>  "that ended in my burning her car where I found them. 
We're really not gonna run any more of his letters
The new policy
Our brothers in blue want us to hold back  and see how he reacts
<i>Four letters in three months,</i>  and this is the first mention of Kathleen Johns
That's very weird
That's because he's full of shit
What do you mean
You don't know
Welcome
Please put your stuff down
You're going down five rows and left
<i>Looking for the Modesto Bee from March.</i>  I'm going to stand here and attempt not to vomit
Left
Left
What am I looking for
Kathleen Johns
<i>Also probably you wanna pull the Chron from...</i>  <i>You know, never mind
I'll see to that.</i>  <i>Okay, look at this letter again
The part about Kathleen Johns.</i>  Tell me what facts he gives
A woman and her baby abducted
Fact
<i> The car on fire
Okay, now,</i>  <i>look at the article from the Bee.</i>  Seen it yet
Everything in the letter already appeared in the article
And he's done it before
<i>Officer Richard Radetich, shot sitting in his car.</i>  Zodiac claimed that he shot someone in their car
Couple days after this article came out
The police already had somebody in custody
<i>Zodiac didn't do it, but took credit for it anyway</i>  because he's in it for the press
He even stole his symbol
What
Yeah
Shit
<i>If I show you something, you promise not to tell anyone?</i>   Who would I tell
Okay
Totally solid point
Okay
That's the only place that word and that symbol  ever appeared together before the letters
The guy stole his logo off a watch
How can somebody who's killed 13 people do...  <i>He claims he's killed 13 people,</i>  but which ones can we actually confirm
<i>There's three in Vallejo, one in Berryessa, the cabbie
That's it.</i>  <i>Bobby, you almost look disappointed.</i>  Chief's pulling everybody off buses
Business as usual
Something'll shake loose
Not a peep in four months
First he won't shut up and now...  Maybe we drove him underground
Maybe he's gone
<i>311 at 582 Haight, cross at Biltmore
There's a male...</i>  <i> Happy birthday, Bill
Thanks.</i>  Does it ever bother you that people call you Shorty
Does it bother you that people call you a retard
Nobody calls me that
Right
<i>As governor, I pledge to use all my influence</i>  <i>to make sure that Darlene Ferrin's killer is brought to justice.</i>  <i>I believe some clues were overlooked in the murder of Darlene Ferrin.</i>  <i> I believe her murder was premeditated
Who is that?</i>  <i>Florence Douglas, mayor of Vallejo
She's running for governor.</i>  <i>I believe that the police department either did not have the money, the time</i>  <i>or, yes, the inclination...</i>  <i>Sayonara, police endorsement
Good work, Flo.</i>  <i>Does anyone ever call me names, or...</i>  You mean like retard
Yeah
No
<i>Shit
Fuck
Oh, my God
Jesus.</i>  Tell me that's not a piece of bloody shirt
Fuck
Holy fucking crap
<i>"I feel it in my bones, you ache to know my name</i>  "and so I'll clue you in
<i>"But then, why spoil the game
Happy Halloween
"</i>  <i>Paul, you did call him a latent homosexual</i>  in at least one of your articles
Dave
I want a gun
A gun
You're in Herb Caen
"Paul Avery's investigation has won him the accolade  <i>"of a message from the Zodiac warning, 'You are doomed
'</i>  <i>"As a result, several crime newsmen are wearing lapel buttons reading,</i>  "'I am not Paul Avery. "
You should sell these
You could do well
<i>It's been a windfall, since they published the threat on my life.</i>  I got the leads coming out of the woodwork
There's one guy down in Riverside
I'm gonna drive down and see him tonight
<i> You wanna tag along
No, I have a date.</i>   Really
Who is this guy
He wishes to remain anonymous
I wish to remain infamous
So we're going to get along great
Hi
Good evening
Hi
I'm looking for a Melanie
Yes
It's the young lady sitting by herself
Thank you
You must be Melanie
Which would make you Robert
It would
Glynnis told me lots about you
<i> And you have wine, great
I do.</i>  Great
How late am I
<i>Just a few minutes, really
I just got here myself.</i>  Traffic's bumper to bumper
I was at the gun range
<i> Glynnis said you were a cartoonist
Oh, yeah.</i>  <i>Well, what're you doing at a gun range?</i>  Reading
Get some more... You need some more napkins
<i>So, you work with Glynnis.</i>  <i> For her, actually
For her?</i>  <i>Oh, well...</i>  My children are terrified of Glynnis
<i>Me, too.</i>  <i>So, the gun range?</i>  We're..
I'm working on... Do you know the Zodiac
Yeah
I'm working with...   Do you know who Paul Avery is
Sounds kind of familiar
He's the writer that the Zodiac threatened
<i>Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV.</i>  <i>Well, I work near him and he's going down tonight</i>  to track an anonymous tipster down in Riverside
Where is Riverside
It's near L.A.  <i>Oh, wow
I don't think Paul knows that it's that far away.</i>  Sounds kind of dangerous
Yeah
How do you mean
<i>Well, you said it was an anonymous tip, right?</i>  Yeah
<i>So it could be an ambush
I mean, it could be the Zodiac.</i>  Don't you think it's kind of stupid
<i>Yeah, yeah
Well, Paul has a gun.</i>  <i>So, do you know what's good here?</i>  I've never been here before
<i>The pasta, spaghetti?</i>  Are you ready to order yet
<i>Yeah, I'll have the penne vodka
But could you do it in a cream sauce?</i>  Of course
Maybe give us another minute
Do you have any change
<i>Oh, wait, no wait, hold on.</i>  Nope
That's a penny
Do you have to make a phone call
<i>Yeah, you know, when you were saying that the Zodiac...</i>  <i>You know, when you said it was dangerous, I just thought</i>  <i> that it is dangerous, and it's...  Stupid?</i>  Stupid
And I just thought that  I should call his wife and just see if she's heard from him
I have some change
<i>Okay
Well, she said she'd call when she heard from him.</i>   Good
Yeah
<i>Melanie, I should really go home and wait for the call.</i>  Is this some sleazy plan to get me to go home with you
What
No
I'll get the food to go
Hello
Hi
I'm supposed to meet somebody here
Anything
You don't have to stay
Are you kidding
This is the most interesting date I've ever had
<i> Paul
Robert?</i>   Yes
You sitting down
Yes
You sitting down
<i>Yes.</i>  You're not gonna believe this
Dave
<i>In a bizarre twist, the hunted has become hunter.</i>  <i>San Francisco Chronicle reporter and Zodiac target Paul Avery</i>  <i>claims to have uncovered new information</i>  <i>regarding the only unsolved homicide in Riverside County's history,</i>  <i>a 1966 Southern California murder,</i>  <i>that Avery now believes was the Zodiac's first victim.</i>  What
He didn't call you about this
Hang on
<i>The Riverside killer wrote to the press letters</i>  <i>that I then took personally to the Office of Questioned Documents.</i>  <i>And what did this expert tell you?</i>  <i>What I knew in my gut, Ron.</i>  <i>The handwriting matches Zodiac's.</i>  How'd he get the evidence out of Riverside
<i>He took it to Sherwood without telling us, the son of a bitch.</i>  You know how bad this looks
<i>Hey, how do we know that this lead is real?</i>  It's very real
You know how I know
Because I saw it on TV
Excuse me
Dave
Hi
<i>Dave, you know Mel Nicolai
He's working the case for Justice.</i>  <i>Good to see you, Mel.</i>  <i>All due respect, can someone explain to me</i>  why I'm reading about breaks in this case  <i>in the Chronicle instead of getting calls from you?</i>  We got screwed
<i>Dave, come on.</i>  You do get your name in the paper a lot
People talk
<i>I don't ever talk about an open investigation, period
Okay, Ken?</i>  Dave
Hey
Hi
Paul Avery
Can I catch a ride with you gents when we get there
<i>Not a good idea, Paul.</i>  He's gonna make me take a cab when we're going to the same place
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for choosing PSA.</i>  <i> Fair enough
Fair enough
Please take your seats at this time.</i>  <i>Remember, smoking is in the last six aisles only.</i>  <i>Enjoy your flight.</i>   Cross
Hi
Yeah
<i> Detective David Toschi, SFPD
How are you doing?</i>  Great
Thanks for having us down today
Not at all
I hear you have some files for us
I'll show you mine
You show me yours
Frisco huh
That's right
San Francisco
Ken Narlow from Napa
Ken
<i> Mel Nicolai, Justice
Mel.</i>  Here's what we know
Cheri Jo Bates attended Riverside Community College
<i>She studies in the library the night of October 30th, 1966.</i>  <i>She leaves with an unidentified male at closing, 9:00 p. m.</i>  <i>Her body's found the next morning in a parking lot, stabbed to death.</i>  Her car is disabled
<i>Someone cut the coil in the distributor, the battery died.</i>  <i>The someone comes back, offers to help.</i>   Like Kathleen Johns
Who
<i>A woman outside of Modesto, might be a Zodiac victim.</i>  Might
Might be
I have her comp right here in this file
Okay
<i>A typewritten confession was sent to the Riverside Press Enterprise</i>  <i>on November 29th, a month after Bates's murder.</i>  They ran it
"I'm not sick
I am insane
But that will not stop the game
"This letter should be published for all to read. 
He wants to be published
He calls it a game
<i>I mean, this could be our boy.</i>  <i>Six months later, the police, the girl's father, and the paper,</i>  they all received these
<i>Double postage, just like Zodiac.</i>  These are what Sherwood Morrill matched to the Zodiac letters
These and the desktop
Don
This was found a couple of months later by a janitor in RCC storage
Sherwood got a handwriting match off wood
Who etches in their own handwriting
<i>To be honest with you,</i>  <i>our letters and your letters, I don't see it.</i>  How did Paul Avery get his hands on the exemplars
I gave them to him
We talked on the phone the other day for about an hour
And I told him you were gonna be here
You told him we were meeting
Yeah
I also told him we don't think this is Zodiac
<i>Okay, wait a minute.</i>   You don't think this is Zodiac
We got a guy we like for it
<i>We don't have enough to pin it on him yet,</i>  but we're pretty sure it's him
<i>If you don't think this is Zodiac, then why give anything to Avery?</i>  I'm trying to cooperate
<i>Oh, that's how you cooperate
By giving information to reporters?</i>  <i>Look, I don't know about the handwriting,</i>  <i>but Sherwood says it's a match, right?</i>  <i>So, let's just say that your guy did Cheri Jo.</i>  He types the confession
<i>Zodiac reads it in the paper, and he writes a letter taking credit for it.</i>  <i>Now, that's something he's done before.</i>  <i>Look, now you have everything we have.</i>  <i>But, in my opinion, you guys came south for nothing.</i>  <i>FUBAR, gentlemen, FUBAR.</i>  I don't care what he says
This still could be Z
The problem is the entire state already thinks it is
<i>Well, there's your press agent
Talk to him about it.</i>  I come in peace
I don't want any trouble
<i>I really don't want to talk to you right now, Paul
Not now.</i>  <i> Just trying to do my job
Oh, really
Well, now I can't do mine.</i>  <i>We're already screwed with the amount of tips we got on this thing,</i>  and you just freaked out the entire state
<i>I have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ looking at me sideways</i>  and Riverside's telling me I'm on a snipe hunt
<i>Jesus
Hey, Cheri Jo Bates was a gift
I gave that to you.</i>  You and Armstrong never would have found her
This may not be Zodiac
Does that matter to you
What if it is
Does it matter that Riverside may not  be able to make a case against their suspect because of you
<i>Tell it to Sherwood
I'm out here, beating the bushes,</i>  trying to draw him out
We're in this together
<i>No, we're not in anything together, Paul,</i>  because I'm not interested in upping my circulation
<i>Oh, boy
He wrote me
He threatened my life.</i>  <i>Hey, Bullitt!</i>  <i>Been a yearandahalf, you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?</i>   Go fuck yourself
Happily
<i>You should have called me, Paul.</i>  Thank you
<i> Did you see this
Unfortunately, yes.</i>  Here comes every lunatic in California
I'm the Zodiac
And how did you kill your victims
<i>With a gun
No, with a hammer.</i>  All I'm authorized to tell you  is that he's still under government employment
And who authorized you to tell me this
That's all I'm authorized to say
<i>Only a little rat bastard like Andre</i>  could have done something like cut off all the victims' hands
Zodiac didn't cut off any of the victims' hands
<i> Are you sure
Yes, sir.</i>  Travis and I worked here side by side for 10 years
His foot gets crushed in an accident and the killings begin
Coincidence
I don't know
<i>You're a cop, man
Do the math.</i>  Have you considered the killer might be Paul Avery
Frequently
<i>He was drinking Coors, getting a load on.</i>  Starts talking about hunting people
Like that book
Says how you can put a light at the end of a gun  to use as a sight in the dark
He said that
Yeah
<i>So I asked him, "How would you get away with it
"</i>  <i>And he said, "It would be easy</i>  "'cause there'd be no real motive to the thing. 
Then he said he'd write letters to the police  and call himself Zodiac to mess with them
Leigh liked messing with people
You're positive he said "Zodiac"
Yeah
I thought it was a stupid name
So I told him
<i>He got up all upset and said, "I don't care what you think.</i>  "I've thought about it a long time and that's the name I'm gonna use. 
Did you feel like he'd been thinking about it a long time
He was raw about losing his job at the school
He talked about shooting out the tires of a school bus  and picking off the little darlings
He actually used those words
That's what made me remember
<i>Afterwards, I told my wife I didn't wanna see him again.</i>  And I haven't since
<i>Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.</i>  I know he's been up to that lake a bunch of times
Lake Berryessa
Did you ever go with him
Couple times
We went fishing by Putah Creek near there
Tell him when you put it together
<i>About a year ago, in the paper, there was a story about the Zodiac.</i>  And it all comes back
I tried to call the local cops
They blew him off
Thought he was a nut
And you're sure the conversation you had about Zodiac  <i>took place on January 1st, 1968?</i>  It couldn't have been any later
I started a new job in L.A. On January 20th
I had to move
<i> This is my problem
This guy...  Arthur Leigh Allen?</i>  <i>This guy, Leigh, just lays out his entire evil plan</i>  to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day
<i>I don't know
He's angry, he's been drinking,</i>  been thinking about it for a while
I can buy that
So why didn't Cheney contact us sooner
I checked
He did
First recorded contact with the police department about Allen  <i>was in Pomona
January 10th, 1970.</i>  He just got lost in the shuffle
Did Cheney have anything against Allen
Did Allen screw his wife or anything
We're gonna do a full background check
<i>But I got to tell you, I like this guy.</i>  <i>So, let's pull some handwriting samples.</i>  Hi
I talked to Sherwood
He got the samples
What are you having
BLT
<i>So, the check stubs are a wash
There's not enough handwriting.</i>  <i>The application's got more, but it doesn't look like Z's,</i>  <i>so he can't rule him in
But he can't rule him out, either.</i>  <i> Well, that's vague
He needs more samples.</i>  <i>Also, our guy is a pervert.</i>  <i>When Mel got the application from Valley Springs,</i>  they told him that Allen had been fired for touching kids
Touching
Polite euphemism
So what do you want to do
Make some phone calls
Are you done with the fries
Go ahead
<i>Did you and Mr. Cheney have a chance</i>  <i>to look at the copies of the Zodiac letters we sent you?</i>  Yeah
Some of this stuff is pretty creepy
<i> Yeah, we know that
I mean, creepy like Leigh.</i>  He misspells words like that
He thinks it's funny
What about the handwriting
<i>I don't know
Don't you have experts for that stuff?</i>  Our man at Questioned Documents says it's inconclusive
Maybe he did it with his other hand
<i>The letters are a little too neat</i>  <i>for someone to have written with the wrong hand.</i>  <i>But not for Leigh, right.</i>  <i> What do you mean
He's ambidextrous.</i>  <i>He can write with either hand
Didn't you guys know that?</i>  <i>In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.</i>  <i>Job applications, letters to friends, et cetera.</i>  But he writes the Zodiac letters with his right hand  producing a different handwriting that he can't be linked to
<i>We got to see this guy, Chief.</i>   Where is he
Vallejo
<i>He works at Union Oil in Pinole
His brother's up there, too.</i>  See them both
Make sure you call Mulanax
It is his backyard
<i>Oh, right, because that worked so well for us in Riverside.</i>  <i>Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.</i>  <i>You can talk to him in here
Coke machine's busted, by the way.</i>  I'll go get him for you
So how do you guys wanna do this
<i>Well, Bill talked to the informants
He leads, we follow?</i>  It's okay by me
<i>Mr
Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.</i>  This is Inspector Dave Toschi and Sergeant Jack Mulanax
We're investigating the Zodiac murders in San Francisco and Vallejo
<i>Please, sit down.</i>  The informant notified us that you made certain statements  11 months prior to the first Zodiac murder
<i>If they're true, they're quite incriminating.</i>  Do you recall having any such conversation
No
Have you ever read  or heard anything about the Zodiac
When it was first in the paper
But I didn't follow it after those first reports
Why not
Too morbid
I..
I told all this to the other officer
Which other officer
From Vallejo
Do you remember his name
<i>No, but it was right after the murder at the lake.</i>  And what did you tell this officer
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point that weekend to skin dive
That I was alone but I met a couple there
I have their names at home if you want them
<i>That would be great, Arthur.</i>   Leigh
What
Leigh
Nobody calls me Arthur
<i>Also, that day when I came home, my neighbor saw me.</i>  It was around 4:00
But I forgot to tell the other officer that
Neighbor's name
Bill White
He died a week or so afterwards
Heart attack
So I didn't think to call to follow up
<i>The knives I had in my car with the blood on them,</i>  that blood came from a chicken that I killed for dinner
What
I had knives in my car that weekend
Maybe Bill saw them and called the other officer on me
<i>Well, we'll be checking in on that.</i>  <i>Well, let me ask you something else.</i>  Were you ever in Southern California at any time in 1966
Is this about the Riverside killing
Yes
<i>Well, I guess I was there around that time.</i>  I used to go down there a lot
I like the auto races
Informant says that you're ambidextrous
<i>No, that's untrue.</i>  You can't write with both hands
<i>My teachers tried to make me when I was a kid, but I couldn't.</i>  I'm lefthanded
He also said that you made statements about killing school children
That is...  That is horrible
That is... That's a horrible thing to say
<i>So, you weren't angry about being fired from Valley Springs</i>  for touching your students
I'm not the Zodiac
<i>And if I was, I certainly wouldn't tell you.</i>  That's a nice watch
Thank you
May I see it
May I see it
Where'd you get it
It was a Christmas gift from my mother two years ago
That's very sweet
<i>So, tell me something, Arthur.</i>  You don't remember anyone  you might have had a conversation with regarding the Zodiac
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker at Vallejo Recreation
But I couldn't be positive
I used to work there when...  <i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>  What
<i>The Most Dangerous Game
That's why you're here, isn't it?</i>  It was my favorite book in high school
It's about this man who waits for people to get shipwrecked on this island
<i>Because he was tired of hunting animals,</i>  he hunted the people for the challenge
And man is the most dangerous animal of all
That's the whole point of the story
Great book
<i>Or, at least, that's what I told Phil.</i>  May I go
Sure
Thanks for your time
I'm willing to help in any way possible
I look forward to the day  when police officers are no longer referred to as pigs
Thanks
We'll be in touch
So does anyone think this suspect warrants further investigation
These are copies of some of the Zodiac letters that were sent
We'd like you to take a look at them
You think my brother's the Zodiac
<i>Well, we're looking at him.</i>  Are you going to arrest him
<i>Mrs
Allen, we don't arrest people just because we're interested in them.</i>  <i>Well, Leigh's always been troubled.</i>  Is it true about the children
Unfortunately
We don't see him much anymore since we found out
What are your feelings about Don Cheney
Don Cheney
My old roommate
Was he the one who contacted you
That's confidential
<i>Well, Don's a very reliable guy.</i>  <i>If he were to tell you something, I'd believe it to be true.</i>   This one
What about it
<i>Here, where he spells "Christmas" with two "S's
"</i>  We got a Christmas card from Leigh a couple years ago
He spelled it the exact same way
Christmass
Would you still have that
I can look for it
Thank you
That'd be great
Is there anything else we can do to help
<i>The brother said he would search Leigh's apartment</i>  next time he went out of town
That gets you around a warrant
For the time being
<i>If we do find something, Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo,</i>  and we could search the place properly
Now I got a chance to talk to the cop  who interviewed Leigh Allen two days after the Berryessa murders
<i>Doesn't remember how he got onto him,</i>  but didn't think he looked like a killer so he didn't like him for Z
But you do
I wish I could've taken the guy in there
<i>Take it slow, Dave
Try and find more stuff for Sherwood.</i>  A match'll get us farther on the warrants
Avery's on two
Tell him to screw
You want me to communicate that verbatim or can I spice it up a little
<i>Christ, kid.</i>  Yeah
<i> Paul, I've been thinking...  Oh, God save us all.</i>  The letter to Melvin Belli  was sent exactly one year after the Lake Herman Road murder
And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father  was sent exactly six months after her death
She was killed a day before Halloween
Yeah
And you received a Halloween card...  <i>You know, these are all fascinating pieces of news, Robert,</i>  it's a bit early in the day
<i>Paul, it's 11:00 and we missed Editorial.</i>  <i> I'm sorry
I didn't mean to wake you up
No, no, no.</i>  <i> I just thought that...  No, no, no.</i>  This suspect is not your Zodiac
This sample matches the canceled checks and the application
Perfectly
<i>So we've just retested the left hand
I mean, we know he's ambidextrous.</i>  <i>In 38 years, I've never seen anyone that ambidextrous.</i>  Both hands would have commonalities
I'm sorry
Just not gonna work
<i> Homicide, Toschi
Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.</i>  Hey
Mulanax
Yeah
<i>We struck out with the judge.</i>  <i>He won't sign off on a warrant for Allen's house.</i>   Why not
Said it wasn't enough
<i>Now, unless we bring him a handwriting match or some evidence that...</i>  How are we gonna get evidence if we can't toss the house
<i>I don't know.</i>  <i> I truly am sorry
No, no
Thank you, Jack.</i>  What do you wanna do
Don't know what I can do without Vallejo
We need Allen's right hand
We can't get it without a warrant
Are there other guys you should be looking at
<i>Only, what?</i>  Twentythree hundred
<i>Okay, then.</i>  <i>Okay, then.</i>  <i>Paul, you wrote the Justice Department</i>  asking to be put in charge of the Zodiac investigation
I merely suggested...  On our letterhead
...that those with intimate knowledge of the case  create an information clearinghouse  to promote an exchange and free flow of ideas
<i> And that you run it
Well, who better than me?</i>  The marked man
<i>Paul, if you want to work here, I need three things.</i>  <i>One, stop boozing.</i>  <i>Two, stop doing whatever else it is you're doing.</i>  <i>And three, cut this nonsense out.</i>  <i>Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time</i>  <i>you feel my excellent work is no longer in step with this trashy provincial rag,</i>  I'll more than happily...  More than happily decamp for greener pastures
<i>Paul, I mean it!</i>   Paul
Yep
What was that
An editorial ttette
Wanna grab a drink
It's 10:00 in the morning
Late breakfast
<i> Early lunch, or...  Paul.</i>  Are you okay
No
Thank you for asking
Shorty
Let's go out for one
<i>Paul, where are you going?</i>  <i>So, you moved off my brotherinlaw?</i>  We couldn't get a warrant
Last year we arranged for Leigh to get help from a social worker
He only went twice
We saw him recently for the first time in nine months
My motherinlaw brought him by to see the new baby
<i>After he left, I went to see that social worker.</i>  <i>He couldn't talk about a former patient, so I just asked him straight out</i>  if he thought Leigh was capable of killing people
Because of patient confidentiality..
The man said yes
Why hadn't you seen him in nine months
He's going to school in Santa Rosa
Santa Rosa
Where is he living
In his trailer
In Santa Rosa
Sonoma County
We wouldn't have to go through the Vallejo DA
<i>It's been 11 months since you talked to this guy,</i>  and now you wanna search his trailer
<i>If we find something, great.</i>  <i>If not, we get his prints and handwriting samples from both hands.</i>  I thought Sherwood shut you down
What if I can get a second opinion
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes
He trained me at this
<i>Terry, all I need to know is if the suspect is ambidextrous.</i>  Could he possibly have written those letters with his other hand
Between you and me
Because there are differing schools of thought on this
<i>Get the samples of his other hand
If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.</i>  <i>That's the current thinking, according to Terry Pascoe.</i>  <i>Meanwhile, I spoke to a psychologist who'd be willing to testify</i>  that someone who undergoes a personality change like Zodiac  <i>would manifest it physically, altering his handwriting.</i>  Which is why Sherwood couldn't get a match from Allen's samples
<i>We got Terry Pascoe, this psychology guy,</i>  coupled with Cheney..
It could be enough for a warrant
Get Cheney on the record
"And that he would call himself Zodiac. 
Yes
<i>And you're willing to swear to this, under oath, in Superior Court?</i>  Without any hesitation
<i>Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney
Thank you very much for your time.</i>  Thank you
Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen
<i>Lives in Sunset Trailer Court in Santa Rosa, California.</i>  Physical description
<i>Allen is similar in height, weight and build</i>  to a man seen at Lake Berryessa on the day of the stabbings
<i>I understand he doesn't look much like the San Francisco composite.</i>  <i>True
Height and weight are sketchy,</i>  but lumbering Caucasian with a crew cut is right on
We never had much confidence in the composite from the kids
The patrolman who saw Zodiac that night  said he didn't look much like the sketch
Military boot prints
Allen was in the Navy
Wears a size 10andahalf
Same size as the prints found at Berryessa
<i>What about gun?</i>  Cheney says Allen owns several firearms
We'll list them in the warrant
<i> And the ciphers
Could be code training in the Navy,</i>  and people have seen Allen with ciphers in the past
<i>Really
Who?</i>  That would be his sisterinlaw and a man named Phil Tucker  that he worked with at a public pool in Vallejo
And Phil Tucker told us about a conversation that he had with Allen  about how to attach a flashlight to the barrel of a gun
That gives us two sources on the ciphers and two on the flashlight
<i>What about his threats on children?</i>  Suspect worked for elementary schools  <i>and was fired for molestation in March, April '68.</i>  <i> Could give him motive
At the very least, it's home turf.</i>  <i>He'd have knowledge of bus routes,</i>  which the two major threats centered around
<i>What about the bomb?</i>  Allen works as a chemist
Take him through the geography
Vallejo murders
Allen lives in Vallejo with his mother in her basement
Berryessa murder
On the day that the two kids were stabbed  his neighbor saw bloody knives in his truck  which he claimed were used to kill a chicken
<i>Does he have any alibis?</i>  <i>He claimed he did, but he's been unable to produce the names</i>  of the couple he supposedly met on the day of Berryessa
The bottom line is that Allen can't alibi up on anything
<i>Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.</i>  <i> You want to tell me about the name
What name?</i>  Zodiac
Allen wears a watch that bears both the word and crosshair symbol
And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney  a year and a half before it appeared in any letter
<i> John...  That's pretty good, guys.</i>  <i> We think so, too
Let's take it to a judge.</i>  Mr. Allen
This is the Santa Rosa Police Department
We have a warrant to search your residence
Hello
I'll check with the neighbors
Close the door
<i>Close the door, there's rodents running around.</i>  Neighbor said he tore out of here about a halfhour ago
You think somebody tipped him
We're not leaving till he comes back
I'll check the back
Jesus
What
Squirrels
<i>Piece of work, this guy.</i>  <i>Not one, but two blue windbreakers.</i>   Like the Stine scene
We'll have those checked for blood
And a pair of black gloves
<i>Men's seven, just like the ones we found in the cab.</i>  <i>Well, he's got the same size shoes and gloves as Z.</i>  Probably just a coincidence
<i>Dave, I got a gun
Check that
Two guns.</i>  <i>They're both
22s
One automatic, one revolver.</i>  <i>Well, that's interesting.</i>  Because he happens to have an M1 rifle here in the closet
For little darlings bouncing off buses
Someone's here
<i>Hello, Arthur
Remember us?</i>  No
On the handwriting
<i>Ballistics, no match
Prints, no match
Writing, no match.</i>  <i>On both hands, right?</i>  Because we got handwriting from both his hands
And neither hand matches
Forget Sherwood
Let's get another opinion
<i>Fellas, he's not your guy.</i>  Damn it
Hey
What do you want
Time off
A hug
Do you know what the worst part of this is
I can't tell if I wanted it to be Allen so bad  <i>because I actually thought it was him, or I just want all this to be over.</i>  It's because you thought it was him
<i>And I did, too.</i>  You know what
Take some time off
Spend some time with your wife and the kids
Go to Candlestick
See a movie
<i>"To the city of San Francisco, I will enjoy killing one person every day</i>  <i>"until you pay me $100,000.</i>  <i>"If you agree, say so tomorrow morning</i>  <i>"in the personal column San Francisco Chronicle,</i>  <i>"and I will set up meeting.</i>  <i>"If I do not hear from you,</i>  <i>"it will be my next pleasure to kill a Catholic priest or a...</i>  <i>"... Scorpio
"</i>  <i>Who's out of their minds?</i>  I've got to get out of here
<i>Where the hell does he expect me to find $100,000?</i>  <i>You're not thinking of paying him, are you, Mr. Mayor?</i>  <i>The city of San Francisco does not pay criminals not to commit a crime.</i>  The killer gets shot in the chest
That's how it ends
Do I know you
<i>I'm Robert Graysmith
I work at the Chronicle with Paul Avery.</i>  Dave Toschi
Nice to meet you
Dave
That Harry Callahan did a hell of a job with your case
<i>Yeah
No need for due process, right?</i>  <i> What do you do at the Chronicle
I'm a cartoonist.</i>  That's nice
You're gonna catch him

<i> Nice to meet you

Guy who used to work here was a great reporter
<i>Oh, yeah
Oh, I'm sure he was.</i>  <i>I mean, it's a honor to leave the Chronicle</i>  <i>and go work for the Sacramento Bee.</i>  <i>Dare to dream, right, Robert?</i>  <i> Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you, too.</i>  I'm just right down there at the Art department  <i> if you need anything, Duffy
Yeah.</i>  <i> You sure you don't want the car, Bill
It's your turn.</i>  <i> You sure you don't want the car, Bill
It's your turn.</i>  You could just drop me off at my place and take the car
You should keep the car
Yeah
I'm not coming in tomorrow
Why
What's up
I'm done
I put in for a transfer
Where
Looking at Fraud
I can't be on call anymore
I wanna see these kids grow up
<i>Hey, good for you, Bill.</i>   You'll be okay
Yeah
I'll be fine
<i>Hey,</i>  <i>I'm not leaving you holding the bag on anything, am I?</i>  No
Okay
<i>Hey, you know what?</i>  <i>Maybe you'll have a chance to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff.</i>  Yeah
I'm not Paul Avery
<i>The boys need to be tucked in, please, and the baby needs changing.</i>   I'll flip you for it
You wish
Nobody has more Zodiac crap than you do
<i> Are you kidding me
Hi, Paul.</i>  Permission to come aboard
It's right there
<i>Anyway, you got shoes on
This is perfect right here.</i>   That's the one
Okay
<i> See that
Mesmerizing
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>  My own kids would kill me for one of those
How are you
Fantastic
<i>I mean, admittedly,</i>  <i>the Bee ain't exactly the Chron, but fuck it, right?</i>  <i>Do you want a drink
I don't have anything blue, but I got...</i>  Don't worry about that
Don't worry about it
It's no bother at all
Nobody comes by from the old days
Cheers
To your health and mine
Mostly mine
<i>So,</i>  what's new
I've been thinking
Yeah
Somebody should write a book
<i>Somebody should write a fucking book, that's for sure.</i>   About what
About Zodiac
It's not new
<i>I've been thinking that if you put all the information together,</i>  maybe you could jog something loose
And then I was thinking that nobody knows the case better than you
Yeah
That's true
<i>You know all the players, and you have all the files.</i>  Lost them
You lost them
Or I tossed them
I don't know
I moved onto a boat
<i>You know that we work in the daily business, right?</i>  <i>As in, today.</i>  What do you think we were doing back then
Do you know that more people die in the East Bay commute  every three months than that idiot ever killed
<i>He offed a few citizens,</i>  <i>he wrote a few letters, and he faded into a footnote.</i>  Not that I haven't been sitting here idly  waiting for you to drop by and reinvigorate my sense of purpose
It was four years ago
Let it fucking go
You're wrong
It was important
<i>Then, what did you ever do about it?</i>  <i>If it was so fucking important, what did you ever do?</i>  <i>You hovered over my desk, you stole from wastebaskets.</i>  Am I being unkind
<i>Oh, that's right, I forgot
You went to the library.</i>  I'm sorry I bothered you
<i> Hey, hi
Hi.</i>   Where you been
The library
Thank you
<i> Inspector Toschi
Yeah
One moment, please.</i>   Hi
Hi
We met at the movies once
It must have been magical
<i>I'm Robert Graysmith
I work at the Chronicle.</i>  I was wondering if I could buy you lunch
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch
<i>Sure, why not?</i>  <i>So, you're a friend of Paul Avery's?</i>  He's actually the reason I'm here
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac
<i>Well, I appreciate the interest, but we don't discuss open cases.</i>  <i>Oh, well, what's going on with it, day to day?</i>  We're actively pursuing all leads
<i>And you're the only one on it, right?</i>  <i>Mr
Graysmith,</i>  Zodiac hasn't written in three years
You know how many murders we've had in San Francisco since then
No
Over 200
That's a lot of dead people and grieving families that need our help
<i>So, nobody cares.</i>  Excuse me
I care
Okay
Can I show you something
I've been doing research on the first cipher
Everything an amateur would need to create it  can be found in these books
<i>Now, I started thinking that if you can track these books,</i>  then maybe you can track the man
<i>So, I remember you thought that Zodiac was military,</i>  so I went to every base library and I got a list of every person  who's ever checked out these books and that's when I found this
Missing
It means they were stolen
<i>So, almost every book on ciphers was stolen from the Presidio Library?</i>  And the Oakland Army Terminal Library
Somebody didn't want a record of ever having checked out these books
Who are you again
I just wanna help
I can't allow you to help
I can't discuss the case with you
<i>I can't give you information, and I certainly couldn't tell you</i>  to go see Ken Narlow in Napa
N ARLOW
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith, but we don't cooperate with writers.</i>  <i>Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.</i>   And Dave Toschi sent you
Yes
Why
Maybe he...  Maybe he thought that I could do some good
<i> What are you, some kind of boy scout
Eagle Scout, actually, first class.</i>  <i>Well, if you wanna do this, don't let me stop you.</i>  <i>Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.</i>  I understand what you're trying to do
But this is an open police investigation
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's
And he said that you might be able to help
<i>I mean, the case is dead
Zodiac's long gone.</i>  <i>He's yesterday's news, right?</i>  That's what they say
<i>So, what's the harm?</i>  <i>No pens, no paper.</i>  <i>Anything that you see that's relevant, you got to remember in your head.</i>  Okay
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>   Which one
All of them
And there's more in the next room
They're all marked with these numbers
243146
<i>You don't smoke, do you?</i>  Once
In high school
What's this
Thank you
<i>Man, you really creeped us out.</i>  <i>"Nine millimeter.</i>  <i>"Said nothing and began firing
"</i>  "Most Dangerous Game
<i>"Do not eliminate this suspect because of handwriting.</i>  <i>"Not because of handwriting.</i>  <i>"Darlene's sister, Linda.</i>  "It was all just deep breathing
George
"It was a strange man
George
Strange man. 
Thank you so much
<i>Oh, briefcase
Oh, thanks.</i>  <i> Hey, Jack
Hey, Bawart.</i>   Who's that
That's Graysmith
Some cartoonist
Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac
<i>Well, good for him.</i>  <i> Thank you for meeting me, Inspector
No
We're not meeting, Robert.</i>  We're just two guys who happen to be sitting  on the same bench at the same time
I've got five minutes
I've got to get back to the Hall
<i>Okay
As far as you know, did anyone ever get in touch</i>  with Mike Mageau during your investigation   and show him suspect photos
Why
<i>Well, he's the only surviving victim who ever saw Zodiac without a mask.</i>  <i>No, I mean, why are you asking me?</i>  <i>Mageau and Darlene, that's Vallejo's case.</i>  Paul Stine is mine
You've got four minutes now
Darlene Ferrin was being followed
<i>Now, I know Mulanax says that they already found this guy,</i>  a George Waters
But he also said that she had a lot of admirers  who would come to the restaurant where she worked
She was popular
Very
Yeah
So...  <i>She and her husband, they move into their new house,</i>  and one night they throw this painting party
And what's a painting party
It's a party where people come and help you paint
Sounds like a terrible party
<i>Well, supposedly, somebody who's not Waters shows up.</i>  And Darlene is terrified of him
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac
<i>And if Zodiac knew Darlene, then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.</i>  Maybe
But Mageau's gone
<i>So if you wanna connect Darlene to Zodiac,</i>  you're gonna have to find another way
I have another way
Phone calls the night of Darlene's murder
<i> Yeah, Zodiac called the police
No, Dave, there were four other calls.</i>  <i>There were two to Darlene's house, one to Darlene's brotherinlaw,</i>  and one to Darlene's fatherinlaw
Just heavy breathing
<i>They started around 1:30 a. M.,</i>  and this was before anyone in the family knew that Darlene had been shot
This was in the Vallejo files
Yeah
God damn it
<i>It's got to be more than just a coincidence, right?</i>  <i>I mean, somebody doesn't just randomly prank phone call a victim's entire family</i>  90 minutes after they were shot
<i>So, either Zodiac shoots a random couple,</i>  then he recognizes Darlene...  Or Darlene was shot on purpose
<i>Either way, Zodiac had to have known Darlene.</i>  <i>That's good, Robert.</i>  <i>So, I can't find Mageau, so maybe I can find Darlene's sister.</i>  And maybe she can tell me who this mystery man is
Try that
I've got to go
She's very cute
<i>You know,</i>  it's interesting that you should mention Zodiac calling people at home
He did that in San Francisco once
What
Who did he call
I can't tell you
That's privileged information
But maybe Melvin Belli could
Melvin Belli
How do I get to Melvin Belli
<i> He should be along soon
Oh, that's all right.</i>  <i>I've really..
I've only been waiting two hours, so...</i>  He's usually not this late
<i>Oh, cookies
Thank you
These look great.</i>   You are here on business
I'm writing a book about the Zodiac
I remember that
I spoke to him
<i> You mean to Mr. Belli about the case
No, to the Zodiac when he called.</i>  He said he had to kill because it was his birthday
He said it..
Wait
He said it was his birthday
Yes
You want something to drink
<i> When was this
Oh, so many years ago.</i>  Mr. Belli was away for Christmas
Gone for a week
<i>The Zodiac called, wanting to talk to him.</i>  <i>I said, "He is not here
"</i>  <i>He said, "I have to kill
Today is my birthday
"</i>  And then he hangs up
Then the letter arrived
<i>So, the call came before the letter of December 20th.</i>  Mr. Belli was gone for a week
He came back on Christmas
Not a good day to work
<i>So, he left on the 18th.</i>  Is that helpful
She said it was his birthday
<i>Well, you'd have to confirm that, now wouldn't you?</i>  How
<i>Well, I never spoke to her, but maybe my partner did.</i>  <i> How do I get a hold of him
You don't
Bill wanted out of this.</i>  <i>As far as I'm concerned, he should stay out.</i>  How do I confirm it
<i>Well, if my partner did talk to someone from Justice,</i>  <i>then they would've had to put that in a report.</i>  <i>That's standard procedure.</i>  <i> Okay
Mel Nicolai.</i>  <i> Thank you
Goodbye.</i>  I just need to confirm a date
Mr. Graysmith..
I've narrowed it down  <i>between the 18th and the 20th of December, and I just need...</i>  <i>Okay, I'll play
Let's say this phone call did take place.</i>  Let's say it really was Zodiac
Why would he volunteer the day he was born
<i>Plus, nobody died on December 18th,</i>  <i>just like nobody died over the weekend when he was gonna kill a dozen people,</i>  or when he was gonna shoot school kids or blow up buses
<i>He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.</i>  What if he made a mistake
What if he wasn't lying
What if it was him on the phone
<i>He didn't expect to pick it up, a nice person to pick up.</i>  What if
What if
What if
<i>Look, off the record, Bill Armstrong checked this out.</i>  We took this very seriously
None of the suspects had the same birthday as this phantom caller
Bill Armstrong
Can I give you a piece of advice
You're looking in the wrong place
<i>Handwriting, fingerprints, that's what this whole thing's about.</i>  Stick to the evidence
Hi
Hey
How was your day
Long
Who's Sherwood Morrill
He's a handwriting expert in Sacramento
He called
He said he can meet you tomorrow morning at 7:00
<i>Oh, great.</i>   So you're taking off work
Just an hour
Sacramento's two hours away
Really
Yes
What's this
<i>Oh, that's that article.</i>  "Robert Graysmith has quietly been shopping his book about the Zodiac. 
Yeah
It talks all about you researching Zodiac
<i>Well, that's what the article's about.</i>  I'm not so sure that's something we want people to know about
Why
Are you embarrassed
<i>Robert, what's the one thing we know about Zodiac?</i>  <i>He reads the Chronicle.</i>  <i>Yeah, but he's never gonna read Herb Caen.</i>  <i> Hello
Mr. Graysmith?</i>  <i>The Robert Graysmith mentioned in the paper today?</i>  <i> Yeah
I can tell you who the Zodiac is.</i>  Who is this
<i>The Zodiac Killer is obsessed with movies.</i>  <i>He recorded his murders on film.</i>  <i>I tried to tell the police, but they wouldn't follow through on it.</i>  <i>There's a man you need to find
His name is Bob Vaughn.</i>  <i> Pen, pen
V AUGHN.</i>  <i>He's a friend of the Zodiac's.</i>  <i>Mr
Vaughn does not know his friend is a killer,</i>  <i>and he is storing some film canisters for him.</i>  <i>In these canisters is the evidence.</i>  <i>Okay, yeah, friend
Who is this friend?</i>  <i>You have quite enough to get started.</i>  <i>Oh, please.</i>  <i>The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.</i>  Your toast is burning
We choose at some point in our lives how to physically construct each letter
We choose at some point in our lives how to physically construct each letter
<i>Once we lock that into our brains,</i>  <i>our handwriting may change over the years,</i>  but the moves themselves remain unaltered
Understand
Yes
Except Zodiac's doesn't
Specifically with his "K."  <i>In his first letters, he executed the "K" with two strokes.</i>  <i>Later letters, he did them with three.</i>   Why
We don't know
<i>Excuse me, I've got to spray this.</i>  How many suspects were cleared through handwriting
All of them
Also the print in the cab
No match was ever found
Is there any way that someone could beat a handwriting test
No
<i>Whoever the Zodiac is, he's not someone I cleared.</i>  <i>About a month ago, a man showed up on my doorstep very distraught.</i>  His name was Wallace Penny
He said he knew who the Zodiac was
Gave me a name
Rick
Rick somebody
Rick Marshall
Yeah
<i>I think that the man who you talked to called me, too.</i>  <i>After he left, then I checked my files.</i>  I never cleared a Rick Marshall
Hello
Hello
Who is this
It's a wrong number
Does the name Rick Marshall mean anything to you
What are you after
What do you got
<i>Hypothetically, you just named my favorite suspect in the whole case.</i>  This is off the record
<i>Couple years back, I was trying to get Marshall's prints.</i>  I handed him a photo
<i>He looks at it
He's about to give it back and he stops and he says,</i>  <i>"My goodness, I got fingerprints all over this
"</i>  And he wipes them off
Why didn't you test him for handwriting
<i>Because when they finally did run his prints,</i>  they cleared him against the one in Stine's cab
<i> So, then, it's not him
Maybe yes, maybe no.</i>  No
What do you mean
Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene
<i>If he had the foresight to bring gloves with him,</i>  how the hell's he gonna accidentally leave a print behind
But it was in the victim's blood
<i>Could have been one of the bystanders,</i>  <i>or a cop just reaches out, boom, false print.</i>  <i>Yeah, but that print disqualified 2,500 suspects.</i>  Which is why we also used handwriting
But not for Rick Marshall
SFPD saw a handwritten sign in the window of his house
<i>Decided it looked nothing like the Z letters, so they just moved on.</i>  How do they know that Rick Marshall wrote the sign
My thoughts exactly
Rick Marshall was a Navy man
He received code training
He was also a projectionist at a silent film theater
<i>Well, then, how do I get copies of Rick Marshall's handwriting?</i>  <i>Three ways
One, get a warrant, which you can't.</i>  <i>Two, get him to volunteer, which he won't.</i>  <i>Yeah, and three?</i>  Get creative
<i>I don't know what to tell you
You get it, I'll analyze it.</i>  <i>Beyond that, you're on your own.</i>  <i>Okay, what about the guy who came to see you,</i>  the one who called me
<i>You mean Wallace Penny?</i>  Yeah
Did he leave a number
<i> Hello
Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.</i>  <i>How did you find me?</i>  I need a sample of Rick Marshall's handwriting
<i>I told you
Vaughn is who...</i>  <i>Mr
Penny, if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac,</i>  I need a sample of his handwriting to confirm it
Can you help me or not
<i>Rick used to draw movie posters for the theater Vaughn worked at.</i>  <i> I'll send one down
Thank you.</i>  <i> I'll need to see more samples
Yeah, but is it...</i>  It's as close as I've ever seen
We have to tread lightly here
We're talking about implicating this man as the Zodiac
I can get more
I'll just find Vaughn and I'll track down Linda
<i>I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister.</i>  <i>I've been to the DMV, and I talked to her parents,</i>  <i>but still, nobody knows where to find her.</i>  <i>Mr
Graysmith, most of the writing matches the exemplar.</i>  <i>In a way, though, it's the part that doesn't match that scares me the most.</i>  <i> What do you mean
Well, on the poster,</i>  <i>the one letter that absolutely, positively does not match</i>  is the letter "K."  <i>You wouldn't happen to have any animal crackers in there, would you?</i>  <i>Unit Five
Toschi needs to call in on a landline.</i>  <i> Dispatch
Hey
Dave Toschi.</i>  <i>I'll connect you.</i>  <i> Dave
Yeah
What's up?</i>  <i>Jennings here from the Chronicle.</i>  It came in this morning and you need to see it right now
See what
<i>The new Zodiac letter
And it mentions you.</i>  <i>Okay, okay.</i>  <i>Shit
All right, come on.</i>  Hall of Justice
<i>Now
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!</i>  Dave
Do you have it with you
"This is the Zodiac speaking
I'm back with you
<i>"Tell Herb Caen I am here, I have always been here.</i>  <i>"That city pig Toschi is good, but I am smarter and better.</i>  <i>"He will get tired, then leave me alone.</i>  "I'm waiting for a good movie about me

"I'm now in control of all things. 
These guys are from Internal Affairs
We need to talk
<i>Good evening
Our top story tonight,</i>  <i>Good evening
Our top story tonight,</i>  <i>the San Francisco Police Department has confirmed</i>  <i>that the man who calls himself the Zodiac</i>  <i>and terrorized the Bay Area has broken his silence of 51 months.</i>  <i>In a letter claiming, "I am back with you,"</i>  <i>the Zodiac makes no overt threats against the citizenry,</i>  <i>and muses that his life and times would make the best movie script yet.</i>  These carrots are perfect
<i>The terse 66 word message also manages...</i>  Just go
<i>...to mention San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen</i>  <i>and the Department's own David Toschi by name.</i>  <i> May I be excused
Are they targets?</i>  <i>Fine, but you have to come back</i>  and finish at least half of what's on that plate
<i>More team coverage on the cipher slayer's return...</i>   Okay
Okay
<i>...begins as Alan Freeman has more.</i>  <i>Thank you, Eric.</i>  <i>San Francisco Chronicle columnist Armistead Maupin says</i>  <i>that he thinks not only is this new letter a forgery,</i>  <i>but it was written by the very man</i>  <i>trusted to hunt down this killer, David Toschi.</i>  <i>Maupin, a very wellrespected author, has gone on record saying</i>  <i>that he believes Toschi wrote the letter to drum up publicity for himself.</i>  Maupin used David as a character in his column
David got a kick out of it  and so he wrote a couple of anonymous letters  asking for the character to be brought back
<i>It was like writing fan mail to himself
That's all.</i>  <i>But David did not write that letter.</i>  <i>No, I'm sure that he didn't
And I'm sure that this will all blow over.</i>  <i>Blow over?</i>  They kicked him out of Homicide
They made him give his handwriting like some common criminal
<i> May I talk to him
No.</i>  <i>Okay, can you just ask him</i>  if he ever investigated a man named Rick Marshall
Is that all you can think about
<i>Mr
Graysmith, Maupin works at your paper
We trust...</i>  <i>This girl, she wants music lessons?</i>  Dave
Dave
I'll catch up to you
You stop calling my house
Do you understand me
I just need your help to find Linda
<i> Jesus
Look, two seconds.</i>  <i>Look, we've been running handwriting samples.</i>   Who's we
Sherwood and I.  Sherwood
Sherwood who was fired from Questioned Documents
Sherwood who drinks like Paul Avery now
He retired
Is that what he told you
<i> What, are you saying he's wrong
I'm saying stop calling my house.</i>  <i> We ran them on Rick Marshall
No, Robert.</i>  <i>No, I know you don't think it's him.</i>  <i>I mean, no, I am not having this conversation.</i>  <i>But I think that Marshall knew Darlene, and I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,</i>  so I'm gonna talk to Bob Vaughn
<i> Robert
Robert, stop it
What?</i>  <i>Okay, the Rick Marshalls of this world will suck you dry.</i>  They're blind alleys
<i>But he said he wasn't gonna announce his murders anymore, Dave.</i>  He was just gonna do them
Do you know what the chances of us arresting someone are now
<i>Too much time has gone by, okay
Too much of the evidence is lost.</i>  <i>People get old, Robert
They forget.</i>  <i>Now, I have been a cop for 25 years
Murder police for 12.</i>   What do you do for a living
You know what I do for a living
You're a cartoonist
So what are you saying
I am saying Zodiac was my job
It is not yours
<i> He's still out there, Dave
No, Robert
I am through with this.</i>  I am through with you
<i>What about September 26, 1970?</i>  <i> Okay, which one was that
The Lake Tahoe nurse goes missing.</i>  One day before the vernal equinox
Dad
Yeah
Mark that
<i>Got another one
June 19th, 1971.</i>  That's got to be near the summer solstice
<i>Oh, guys.</i>  <i>Don't tell Mom about our special project, okay?</i>  How come you and Mom don't sleep in the same bed anymore
Hello
<i>Mr
Graysmith, it's Ken Narlow from Napa.</i>  <i>Oh, Captain Narlow
Thank you for calling me back.</i>  <i>Yeah
How can I help?</i>  I called you because we've been crossreferencing lunar cycles  with the Zodiac's timeline
<i>More often than not, each cycle since '69 corresponds with an attack</i>  <i>or with one of the letters, or an unsolved homicide.</i>  <i> Who's working with you on this
Some colleagues.</i>  Dad
<i> Ken, can you hold on one second
Dad?</i>   What is it
What's this
<i>In the decade since the Zodiac's last cipher was received,</i>  <i>every federal agency has taken a crack at decoding it.</i>  <i>But today, where those agencies had failed,</i>  <i>a cartoonist has succeeded.</i>  <i>How did you do it?</i>  <i>Oh, just a lot of books from the library, and I love puzzles, so I just...</i>  Yeah
The fucking library
<i>I believe that you can accomplish anything that you put your mind...</i>  That's a "J"
Okay
Honor Camp
Thank you so much
<i>Hey, we found Linda
She's in jail
Isn't that great?</i>  Why'd you do it
Because she'll be able to identify Rick...   What are you talking about
You went on TV
You put yourself out there for him to see
<i>Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.</i>  Then who's been calling our house in the middle of the night  at least once a week
Nobody
What's it gonna take for you to be done with this
I can't talk about this now
I have to go see Bob Vaughn
<i>Well, that's too bad, because we're gonna talk about this.</i>  And when is it gonna be finished
When you catch him
When you arrest him
Be serious
I am serious
I need to know who he is
<i>I need to stand there,</i>  I need to look him in the eye and I need to know that it's him
Is that more important than your family's safety
Of course not
Why
Why do you need to do this
Why
Because nobody else will
That's not good enough
Are you done
Can I go
Mr. Vaughn
Mr. Graysmith
Yes
Hi
You needed to speak to me
Yes
There's a coffee shop right on the corner
<i> Why don't we just go to my home
Oh, I don't wanna put you out.</i>  It's no trouble at all
Where are you parked
Just right there
You can follow me
Oh
Okay
Watch your step
Come in
<i> Very nice house
Oh, thank you.</i>  It's very rustic
<i> Can I take your jacket
No, thank you, I'm fine.</i>  <i>Okay
This way, please.</i>   Have a seat
Thank you
<i> How about some tea
Oh, no, I'm all right.</i>   You sure
Yes
I wanted to ask you about a film that the Avenue may have played  while you were the organist there
<i>The Most Dangerous Game?</i>  <i>Oh, it's a classic
RKO
1932.</i>  <i>Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks
We've run that picture many times.</i>  <i>In '68, '69?</i>  I'd have to check my records
Why
Do you remember the Zodiac
<i>This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?</i>  <i> He was a projectionist there, right
For a time, yes.</i>  But I have no occasion to correspond with him these days
<i>Okay
Well, there is a connection</i>  between one of the Zodiac attacks and that film
You mean the symbol
Hold on
The Zodiac symbol on film
It's on the countdown
<i>It's trimmed off each reel before it's shown,</i>  but it always arrives with it
Right there
<i>The first time I saw it in the papers, I thought about that.</i>  We got a tip  that Rick left a film canister here that he told you never to open
A tip about a mysterious film canister
Is it true
Yes
Did you open it
No
May I see it
Rick took it back in 1972
This tip is how you got it in your head that Rick is the Zodiac
That and the poster
The poster
The poster that Rick drew
The handwriting is the closest that we have ever come to a match
<i> Rick didn't draw any posters
No, he drew this one.</i>  <i>Mr
Graysmith, I do the posters myself.</i>  That's my handwriting
I won't take any more of your time
Why don't I just go and find out when we played that film
<i>Oh, that's all right.</i>  It's not a problem
They're just down in the basement
Not many people have basements in California
I do
<i>You coming, Mr. Graysmith?</i>  <i>The original studio onesheets, I always kept for myself.</i>  The cheapo knockoffs like you brought today  I end up tossing into the back alley
'69
You live alone
<i>Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.</i>  <i>So, that would be about</i>  <i>nine weeks before the first Zodiac letter, correct?</i>  Yeah
Do you think he saw the film in our theater and was inspired
Are you sure there's nobody else in the house
Would you like to go upstairs and check
No
Thank you
Thanks for everything
You're welcome
It's locked
Thank you
<i>Good night, Mr. Graysmith!</i>  Two killers
Got to be two killers
One has the...  Guys
You've got five minutes
Linda
<i>Hi, I'm Robert.</i>  Did you get my note
What's this about
Zodiac
Figures
You got the look
What look
I didn't mean anything
Tell me about this painting party
I told the cops about that so long ago
<i>Darlene always had a lot of boys around,</i>  even though she was married
<i>And this one guy was weird, though.</i>  He used to bring her presents from Tijuana and..
I don't know why she was friends with him
She once told me he'd killed somebody
Really
<i>Yeah, I think maybe when he was in the service.</i>   Navy
I think so
Was he into movies
Was he a movie buff
I can tell you that he was not into people
<i>The party Darlene threw,</i>  <i>people were supposed to just show up and drink beer, help paint.</i>  <i>But this guy showed up in a suit,</i>  and just sat in a chair all by himself all night long
Didn't talk to anyone
And Darlene told me to stay away from him
She was scared of him
<i>And a couple of weeks later, she was dead.</i>  I'm sorry
Do you remember his name
<i>I mean, it was short, like a nickname, like Stan.</i>  <i> Rick
No, I don't think so.</i>   Are you sure
Yeah
How can you be sure
It was a long time ago
Think hard
I am thinking hard
It was Rick
<i>No, it wasn't.</i>   It was Rick
It was Rick Marshall
No
Just say it
It wasn't Rick
It was Leigh
<i> Leigh
Yeah, Leigh.</i>  <i> Leigh
Yeah, Leigh.</i>  Sounds right
Officer
I need you to let me in
<i> Is this an emergency
No, I just need to see one file.</i>  <i>No, you need to come back tomorrow morning.</i>  <i> One file, just for one second
8:00 a. M., when we're open.</i>  Sergeant
Sergeant Mulanax
<i>Sergeant, I just need to see one file!</i>  Just give me five minutes
I know exactly where it is
Please
I shouldn't be talking to you
You got five minutes
Okay
Here
Here
<i>Linda states that some of Darlene's closest friends are Leigh,</i>  who used to bring Darlene presents from Tijuana
So what
He knew her
Linda said Leigh
This is Leigh
No
That's just one name in a file that contains hundreds
It's nothing
Dave Toschi...  Agrees with me
Our investigation into this subject is over
I'm sorry
Hello
Who's there
<i> You didn't return my calls
Oh, I've been kind of busy.</i>  Yeah
I can see that
How's the book coming
I tried to send you these
<i>I called the Chron.</i>  <i>Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so...</i>  I heard
When's the last time you ate something
Nothing makes sense anymore
<i> Did it ever
Yeah, it did.</i>  <i>Robert, it was just the date that didn't end.</i>  You don't mean that
A little
The kids miss you
I can't have them see me like this
Neither can I
<i>So, do whatever you have to,</i>  but finish this
Dave
Dave
It's Robert
Dave
Is he actually here
I'm gonna kill him
I'm calling SFPD
Where's my gun
Dave
Robert
Go away
Dave
He made a mistake
Get away from the window
I'll meet you around front
<i>No, you won't.</i>  <i> You have to hear this
No, I don't, Robert!</i>  The birthday was the one time that he was weak
The one time that he gave something away
<i> Robert, I am calling the police
It's Arthur Leigh Allen!</i>  Where did you get that name
He called the Bellis' house
December '69
"I need to kill
Today's my birthday. 
It was his birthday
Arthur Leigh Allen was born on December 18th
Get in here
Here you go
Thanks
<i>He wrote me, you know?</i>  <i>2,500 suspects,</i>  the only one who ever wrote me a letter was Leigh Allen
<i>They like to help, you know, sometimes.</i>  <i>Yes, Robert, I know.</i>  He was arrested January 1975 for molestation
He sent me that when he got out
<i>"Dear Dave, if I can ever be of any help to you, just let me know.</i>  "I'm sorry I wasn't your man. 
And it's typewritten
Using a typewriter is not a crime
And he knew Darlene
It's in the Vallejo files
Mulanax said that he was your favorite suspect
<i>That you spent two years on him, and that nobody ever came close.</i>  All the evidence said no
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting
The same Sherwood that drinks like Paul Avery now
<i>Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill in writing saying,</i>  <i>"I'm sorry, this just won't work
"</i>   But you also have Terry Pascoe...  His protg
<i>Yeah, fine, it's his protg,</i>  <i>but he's a handwriting expert nonetheless, and he's saying,</i>  "Do not disqualify this suspect on the basis of handwriting. 
"Do not disqualify this suspect on the basis of handwriting. 
<i> So the two cancel each other out
No, they don't.</i>  It was Sherwood's case
He was the head of Questioned Documents
<i>If it went to trial,</i>  all the defense would have to do is call Sherwood to the stand
<i>And there was no way of getting Allen into court in the first place,</i>  <i>because there was no evidence, Robert.</i>  <i>What do you mean, there's no evidence?</i>  You have him seen with the ciphers
The military boot prints
The same size shoes and gloves
<i>The Most Dangerous Game
The Zodiac watch.</i>  The background with school children
The misspellings of Christmass
The bloody knives
All circumstantial
<i>Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.</i>  We should have found one of those things in that trailer
We didn't
That's..
Okay
Catherine Allen states that  "Leigh cleaned out his trailer on Friday after work  <i>"and moved it to Santa Rosa on Saturday, August 7th, 1971
"</i>  You interviewed him at the refinery on August 4th
<i> Yeah
So, he's cleaning out his trailer,</i>  he's moving into a different county 48 hours after you interviewed him
<i>Okay
Okay
Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.</i>  All right
<i>Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen and the Zodiac, their timelines.</i>  <i> When was the first murder in Vallejo
Christmas, 1968.</i>  <i>Eight months before that, Allen is fired for molesting his students</i>  and his family discovers that he's a pedophile
<i> Now, when do the letters begin
July, '69.</i>  After the murder of Darlene Ferrin
And they continue until you go to see him at work
<i>Now, after that, do any of the letters contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?</i>  <i>No
Because he dumped them, because he got scared.</i>  Because he knew that you were on to him
<i> So, when's the next letter from Zodiac
Not until January of 1974.</i>  He is silent for three years
<i>Then, in '74, he feels comfortable again</i>  because everybody's moved off Allen as a suspect
And what do we get
<i>Three new letters from Zodiac in January, May, and July in '74.</i>   But then the letters stop
What happens to Allen
He's arrested
<i>January, 1975, they send him to Atascadero.</i>  We don't get another letter from Zodiac the entire time he's there
<i> When is he released
August, '77.</i>  <i>Allen gets out
He types you an apology, and then what?</i>  We get our first new Zodiac letter in four years
<i>Okay
Zodiac had to have known Darlene Ferrin, right?</i>  <i>Yes, because of the phone calls on the night of her murder.</i>  <i>Because of the Vallejo file,</i>  we know that Darlene knew a man named Leigh
Yes
<i>So, all coincidence aside, Robert,</i>  how can you be sure that Leigh Allen is the Leigh from this file
<i>Now, Vallejo is a small town, but it's not that small.</i>  How do you put the two of them together
<i>This is a case that's covered both Northern and Southern California,</i>  with victims and suspects spread over hundreds of miles
Would you agree
Yes
Darlene Ferrin worked at the Vallejo House of Pancakes  on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll
Arthur Leigh Allen lived in his mother's basement on Fresno Street
<i>Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.</i>  Is that true
I've walked it
Jesus Christ
So
<i>The prints, the handwriting...</i>   I'm not asking you as a cop
But I am a cop
I can't prove this
<i>Just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean it's not true.</i>  <i>Easy, Dirty Harry.</i>  Finish the book
Thank you
Thank you for breakfast
Can I help you
No
Mr. Mageau
Thanks for coming to see me
You're the one I talked to on the phone
I'm George Bawart
Vallejo PD
I took over for Jack Mulanax
It's been 22 years
I don't know how I can help you
<i>Well, this is just a formality.</i>  I'm gonna show you a group of photographs
<i>Now, the person that shot you may or may not be</i>  among these photographs
You don't have to pick anybody out  <i>just because I'm showing you these pictures, you understand?</i>  <i>Yes, sir, I do.</i>  All right
Take your time
<i>If you don't recognize anyone, that's okay.</i>  That's him
How sure are you
<i>Yeah, I'm pretty sure.</i>  He had a round face like this guy
Wait
Am I to understand  that you're now identifying the second photograph
<i>No, no
Just that he had a round face like that.</i>  It's this man
All right
<i>Now, on a scale of one to 10, 10 being positive,</i>  how sure are you
At least an eight
<i>The last time I saw this face was July 4th, 1969.</i>  I am very sure that's the man who shot me
