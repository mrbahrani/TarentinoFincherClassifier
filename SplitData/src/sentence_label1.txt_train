1 Hold on
I gotta come up
We can't be late
We won't
If you're not then nobody
We were kind of hoping you were
Yeah
How are you not holding
Jesus Christ Shanna
It is not my fucking job to supply y'all with weed when we go out
Whoa whoa whoa whoa little lady
I was just teasing you
I'm not angry
It just would be nice if y'all didn't just count on me all the fucking time  and surprise me every once in a while with pot
Okay mean girl in a high school movie
Are you through having a tantrum
You've been in the car all of two seconds and you're already cursing at me
I am not cursing at you
You said "Jesus Christ Shanna.
And then before the sentence was over  you threw a "fucking" in there to emphasize your "irritatance.
Come on guys
Don't fight
I'll pay for it when we get some
One: It is not about the money
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring
And two: We're not really fighting
That wasn't a fight
That was Julia acting like a grumpy bitch  and me calling her on it and indulging her at the same time
That's how we tolerate each other after all these years
Oh billboard
So what's the plan man
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's
Of course
You're so good
I know
You bet your ass he is
Christian Simonson the filmmaker is in town
He's got a big thing for Julia
If he had a big thing for me he'd fucking call me  as opposed to disappearing for six months  and he'd get his ass down here more often than he does  and on my birthday give me a fucking phone call
Oh billboard
Yeah but you get those legs of yours around him and it's all over
Yeah well when I'm redecorating his house in the hills  that I am also living in I'll let you know it worked
So margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's touch base with Chris and Jesse  tell them about later and make damn sure they come
Oh shit
Speaking of which what happened with you and Nate last night
Well you know not mu... We just fucking met each other
I mean if you don't bust their balls a little bit they're never gonna respect you
How about enlightening us on what it is you did do
Nothing to write home about
We just made out on the couch for about 20 minutes
Dressed halfdressed or naked
Dressed
We didn't do the thing
Excuse me for living but what is "the thing"
You know it's everything but
I call it "the thing.
Do guys like the thing
Okay I wanna get back to what it is you did do
So you're making out on the couch with Nate right
Correct
Whose couch
His or the one in your hotel room
What am I stupid over here
Mine
We started sitting up
We worked our way to lying down
Mmm the plot thickens
I was straddling him
What else
That was it
So we made out for a little while on the couch  and I said "Okay I'm gonna go to bed now so it's time for you to leave.
And then he starts to whine "Oh right now?
And he says "well wait
what about this?
And I said "No.
He said "What do you mean no
You don't even know what I'm gonna say.
I said "I already know what you're gonna say  and the answer's no.
I said "Because you're gonna say 'let's just go to sleep together
"'We don't gotta do nothing
"'Just cuddle sleep next to each other wake up in the morning together.
No you're gonna leave but I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah fuck Nate
Jesse Letterman..
You can hang out with him you can make out with him  but no hooking up with him because we are driving to Lake LBJ tonight  and my daddy's pretty clear about one thing
He said "I am letting you and your girlfriends stay at my lake house  not you and a bunch of horny boys trying to get their fuck on with my daughter.
Your dad talks like that
Hell yeah
It's not like he ain't gonna know either  because when I'm staying at the lake house with my girlfriends in our bikinis  Daddy just has a tendency to pop up and make sure we don't need anything
Look he's totally harmless and cute as a bug's ear
And if you flirt shamelessly with him like the sixfoot baby giraffe in the backseat  you got a puppy dog for life
I have my own relationship with Ben  and you're just jealous 'cause it don't include you
You call her dad Ben
I'm not a child
So when are the boys showing up
They're gonna meet us at the Chili Parlor
Maybe they can bring some pot
No
I don't wanna be either A depending on their fucking ass  or B depending on their ass
Uhuh
We don't score ourselves  we're gonna be stuck with them all fucking night
Ooh try Lanna Frank
Oh hey that's your last billboard before Guero's
Oh come on
Give me a break
"Oh come on" my ass
We said every time
Jules let me get a drag
Thanks
Oh my God
days Arlene
Hey
You wanna join us
For a second but I'm with some friends
Oh
So you must be... must be..
Shh
She don't know nothing about it
Know about what
When were y'all gonna tell her
Soon
Tell me what
Yeah now thanks to you we gotta tell her sooner than later
All right cut the shit
I said a little somethin'somethin' about you on the air today
All I said was I had a sexy friend named Butterfly  who was in from out of town for the weekend  and we would be going out somewhere in Austin tonight  and if they were out on the town maybe they'd see us
And I described you and I said that if they spotted you while we were out  if they'd do something you'd do something
Okay now Julia I'm serious
What did you say and what did you say I'd do
Anyhoo I could explain what I said which would be boring  or Marcy over here  who is an incredible actress could act it out for you  which I think will give you a better idea  of what you have in store for you tonight
Okay so just tell me your way
So we'll act it out with Marcy
Okay give Marcy your drink
Okay so you're in a club or a bar  and Marcy's a kind of cute or kind of hot or kind of sexy  or better be fucking hysterically funny but not funnylooking guy  who you could fuck
Got it
Okay Marcy take it
Howdy
Hi there
Excuse me but your name wouldn't be Butterfly would it
It seems you have me at a disadvantage
Pleased to meet you Barry
Y'all are getting me hot
Shh
So is uh Butterfly your real name
Yes it is
And how'd you know my name Barry
I listened to Jungle Julia's show this morning
Oh yeah
I listen to her show every morning
Oh you do do you
Yeah
She's like the coolest lady in town
Nah man
I like her ass that way
She got a black girl's ass
She's got a big ass
Okay what the fuck are you doing
Oh look who wants to get to the point all of a sudden
Okay we'll get to the point
But for your information skinny bitch  black men and a whole lot of motherfucking white men  have had plenty fun adoring my ass
All right if you're not gonna buy me a drink can I have mine back
No
Okay okay okay okay
So Butterfly can I buy you a drink
What can I get you
I'll take a margarita
Here you go
"Did you hear me Butterfly
Miles to go before you sleep.
What
If they call you Butterfly buy you a drink  repeat that poem you gotta give them a lap dance
That's bullshit
I ain't giving them nothing
Well you can do it or not but if you don't  everybody in Austin's gonna think you're a chickenshit
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance 'cause of what you said
Oh come on
Yeah everything's funny to you two when it's happening to me
Look you don't have to do it for anybody you don't want
I said you'd do it for the first guy who says it
So some geek comes over trying to be cool  just tell him you already did it at another place earlier
But maybe a little later in the evening  you've had a few drinks you're kind of looseygoosey  you're safe with your girls  then some kind of cute kind of hot kind of sexy hysterically funny  but not funnylooking guy comes up and says it  then maybe you did it earlier maybe you didn't
You made me trip
You made me trip you dumb bitch

We're waiting for you
Shit
Hold on
So where are you
Come over already
No we're not coming over there
You come over here like you said you would
So is it "Shawna" and the girls at the lake house this weekend
Oh fuck
I...  No
Now there is one thing that every girl in the whole world  whose name is Shanna has in common with each other  we all hate the name Shawna  and we really hate it when people call us Shawna
Just remember it's Shanna Banana not Shawna Banawna
Okay but at some point in the evening I had fuckability stock
I mean...  it wasn't bullish but..
Okay Warren's sending over shots
And you know the house rule:  If he sends over shots you've gotta do them
What
Warren says it we do it
I love that philosophy: "Warren says it we do it.
So let's do it
What is it
Here we go
Post time
Mmm
Ow
Now is that a tasty beverage or is that a tasty beverage
What the fuck is it
Chartreuse the only liquor so good they named a color after it
Not me
I'm going out for a smoke
Okay
But careful where you keep that hot flame all right
Drinks
Shanna Banana
Another bigass Long Island iced tea
Bombay Sapphire and tonic no ice
Good boy
Oh

Oh Jesus Christ
Whoa
You scared the fuck out of me you shitty asshole
I swear Arlene I was not trying to scare you
I just got lucky
Oh hardyfuckinghar
Wait a minute
Why
I was thinking we could make out
Not even in the bar but in front of the entrance
Forget it
What out there
It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there
Not in my car it's not
Look you won't get wet
You know most guys wouldn't brag about that
Hahaha
You know what I mean
Look I know you guys are going to Lake LBJ and we can't come
I wanna make out
Okay just stop with the whining
It's not attractive
Deal
No no no
Deal or no deal
If you're gonna whine when I pull the plug in six minutes  we can just walk back inside the fucking bar right now
Deal
No whining
And no begging
When you say done it's done
I'm gonna remember you said that
Okay let's go
Oh you got two jobs:  kiss good and make sure my hair don't get wet
But what's the point
They're going to Shanna's daddy's house at Lake LBJ  and it's no guys... absolutely no guys
Okay so after we bring the girls drinks  in fairly rapid order but not obvious we order two more rounds of shots
You think they're gonna fall for that
We'll be very convincing
No more fucking around
We go to Jäger shots
Man they're not gonna drink Jäger shots
Come on dude we can at least get one shot of Jäger  down these fucking bitches' throats
You never know
That could be the shot that puts them past the point of "fuck it.
Then all of a sudden "no guys at the lake house"  turns into "a couple of guys at the lake house.
My point exactly
I know I can at least get Shanna "Suck My" Banana  to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot
What's Julia's sweet shot
Key lime pie
Even fucking Leroy Brown'd do one more for dessert
I wonder if B.J
brought the Bear with him
♪ Well the last time he shot him ♪  Jesus
♪ Eastbound and down ♪  Dude fucking cut himself falling out of his time machine
Could I get a chicken suit for Stroker Ace please
I had to get something out of the car and Nate was gentlemanly enough  to escort me with his umbrella
Ah good for you Nate
You see that pretty girl sitting by herself at the bar
Meow
She's not a hippie
She might as well be a hippie
Thank you Timmy boy
Well do you know what just happened to her
No
Oh I'm sorry
You were telling a story
What about her
Hey Warren is there anybody in this place you could vouch for to give me a ride home
You've been eavesdropping
Oh eavesdropping and can't help but hear
So uh Icy Hot  are you offering me a ride home
I'm offering you a lift if when I'm ready to leave you are too
And when are you thinking about leaving
Truthfully I'm not thinking about it
But when I do you will be the first to know
Will you be able to uh drive later
I've been drinking club soda and lime all night  and now I'm building up to my big drink
Which is what
Virgin piña colada
Why would someone who doesn't drink  spend hours at a bar drinking water
A bar offers all kind of things other than alcohol
Mmm
Like what
Women nacho grande platters  the fellowship of some fascinating individuals  like Warren here
Alcohol is just a lubricant for all the individual encounters  that a barroom offers
Ooh
Is that cowboy wisdom
I'm a stuntman
But that's a very easy mistake to make
How do you know my name
When you were talking with Warren  couldn't help but overhear
So what's your name Icy
Stuntman Mike
Stuntman Mike's your name
You ask anybody
Stuntman Mike
And who the hell is Stuntman Mike
He's a stuntman
Warren six shots of Wild Turkey

You know Pam I think it's time for my big drink
Well Stuntman Mike  since I have a tab here can I buy you that virgin piña colada
Thank you Pam
That would be lovely
Warren a uh virgin piña colada for my stuntman friend  and I'll have another Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita

What
Seems to keep um getting your attention
Is that the girl from the billboard outside
Yep
She sure is a strikinglooking woman
It's got gin tequila...   Look at that hair
Lots of leavein conditioner
Hardly
But if you wanna get with uh Jungle Julia there's a real easy way to do that
Really
What would that be
Get famous
You won't have to find her
She'll find you
And you don't even wanna know what she did for that billboard
You've earned it
What did she ever do to you
We went to school together from kindergarten through high school
That's what she did to me
She was her height right now at 12
Half the guys she still fucks from the old class  she used to beat up and terrorize in the fifth grade
I see
And she used to beat you up and take your chocolate milk huh
That pituitary case
Sorry
I'm built like a girl not a black man
But I'd die before I ever gave Julia Lucai my chocolate milk
Hey are you famous or something
No no no
Hey what do you do
Really
What I do is work my ass off to get my own record label off the ground
But why that girl wanted a picture of me  is because I'm a local deejay
Wait a minute
You got a billboard by Big Kahuna Burger don't you
Yeah
Yeah
Jungle Julia Lucai
Stuntman Mike McKay
Now my friends and I are gonna continue to get our weed on
Thank you Julia
But just the same no thanks
Suit yourself
But you know...  Aw shit
Sorry
It's nothing
What the fuck was that
Actually I do want you to have a shot
You got some voucher here
I asked him what movies you worked on
No fucking clue
Well technically I really don't know if he's ever done anything for sure
Yeah well there was another actor on that show... Gary Clarke...  and I looked like him a bit
Obviously before I cut myself shaving
Oh I like it
Well damn if you ain't so sweet you make sugar taste just like salt
Anyway I did a lot of Virginians doubling Gary Clarke
From that point on I specialized mostly in car stunts
Yeah I did damn near the whole third season of Vegas
I was Robert Urich's driving double
And then Bob did another show... Gavilan  and he brought me with him on that till...  And after that...  Do you know any of these shows or people I'm talking about
No
No
So how exactly does one become a stuntman  Stuntman Mike
Well in Hollywood  anybody fool enough to throw himself down a flight of stairs  can usually find somebody to pay him for it
But really I got into the business  the way most people get in the stunt business
My brother got me in it
Well who's your brother
I'm trying to get these two shows happening in New York for November
I'm ready to blaze
Finally
Yeah
You need to catch up with us
Now the party can start
Anyhoo I'm sorry
Will you forgive me
But you have to be real nice to me for the whole rest of the time I'm here
Promise
Mmhmm
How about your little friend
You wanna bring him
If you really want him to come Shanna won't mind
So how about it
Boys or just us girls
Good idea
Ladies
Thanks
Cheers Butterfly
"The woods are lovely dark and deep  "and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep
"Did you hear me Butterfly
Miles to go before you sleep.
Sorry Stuntman Burt...  Mike
She already broke off that dance
Is that true
Do I frighten you
Is it my scar
Ah
Yeah I know
Sorry
It's my mom's car
Have you been following us
No
But that's what I love about Austin
It's just so damn small
I saw him outside of Guero's
And I saw you outside Guero's too
You saw my car I saw your legs
So you really weren't following us
I'm not following you Butterfly
I just got lucky
Sorry
It was a onetimeonly offer  and she did it earlier this evening at Anton's
How do you know
I'm good that way
And you look a little touchéd
What's "touchéd"
Wounded slightly
Why should I be wounded
That kind of hurt your feelings a little bit didn't it
There are few things as fetching as a bruised ego  on a beautiful angel
So...  how about that lap dance
I think I'm gonna have to give you a rain check
Well since you'll be leaving in the next couple of days  that rain check will be worthless
I understand if I make you uncomfortable
You're still a nice girl  and I still like you
But I must warn you of something
You know how people say...  "You're okay in my book"  or "In my book that's no good"
And everybody I ever meet  goes in this book
And now I've met you and you're going in the book
Except I'm afraid I must file you...  under "chickenshit.
Well I definitely couldn't file you under "chickenshit" then now could I
What's your name again
Stuntman Mike
Well Stuntman Mike I'm Butterfly
My friend Jungle Julia over here says that jukebox inside is pretty impressive
Yeah it is
Why don't you go get ready for your lap dance
What about "kind of cute kind of hot kind of sexy hysterically funny  but not funnylooking guy who you could fuck"  did you not understand

Have a nice ride
I can hear you
He's old enough to be my dad..
I can still hear you

Wow that's fucking scary
Yeah well I wanted it to be impressive
Scary tends to impress
Is it safe
Oh it's better than safe
How do you make a car death proof
Well that's what stuntmen do
You've seen a movie where a car gets into some smashup  there ain't no way in hell anybody's walking away from
Yeah
Well how do you think they accomplish that
Well unfortunately Pam nowadays more often than not you're right
But back in the allornothing days the Vanishing Point days  the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days  the White Line Fever days...  real cars smashing into real cars  with real dumb people driving them
So you give the stunt team the car you want to smash up  take her and reinforce that fucker everywhere  and voilà you got yourself a deathproof automobile
I just didn't know you could make a car death proof
Hell I can drive this baby into a brick wall  doing 125 miles an hour just for the experience
Why is your passenger seat in a box
Sometimes when you're shooting a crash director wants to put a camera in the car
You know shoot the crash from the inside
That's where you put the camera
They call it a crash box
There you go
You know when you asked to drive me home  you didn't mention your car didn't have a passenger seat
Yeah well actually I didn't ask to drive you home
You asked me for a ride and I said yes
But look at the bright side Pam
I won't be getting fresh putting my hand on your knee
I thought so
Well Pam which way you going
Right
Ah that's too bad
Why
Well because there was a 5050 shot on whether you'd be going left or right
You see we're both going left
You could've just as easily been going left too  and if that was the case  it would've been a while before you started getting scared
But since you're going the other way  I'm afraid...  you're gonna have to start getting scared... immediately
What the fuck
Just fucking let me out of here
Okay here's the thing
I get it
I..
Um but if you just stop right now  you know and... and... and let me out  I'll never tell anybody because I know it's a joke
I know all about jokes
I promise everything will be fine
Just... Just... Just let me out  please and... and...  Hey Pam  remember when I said this car was death proof
Well that wasn't a lie
This car is 100% death proof
Now I gotta catch me my other girlfriends
No no no no
It's Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich
So you got it
Thanks honey
You're gonna play it next song right
Growl
Byebye
Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich
Who
Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich
For your information Pete Townshend at one point almost quit The Who  and if he had he would've ended up in this group  thus making it Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch Tich and Pete

Self restraints to room 310
Self restraints to room 310
Well what's the patient's prognosis Dr. Block
I don't really see it's any of your business
Come on now sis
How bad is he
He got banged up real good
Busted nose broken collarbone  smashed up his left index finger
Is that it
That'll be all
Why that's more than enough and I wanna thank you Dr. Block
Son of a bitch
So Pop what do you think
Well give it a shot
Well what we have here is a case of vehicular homicide
I mean he used a car and not a hatchet but they dead just the same
Well what are you gonna do
Not a goddamn thing
Every one of them gals was swimming in alcohol  and floating on weed
And old Hooper in there  came out clean as a whistle
Now you actually think that he premeditatedly murdered them gals
Well I can't prove it  but since thinking don't cost nothing I can think it and I do
Well hell yeah he got banged up but God damn
Them pretty little gals look like a goddamn giant  chewed 'em up and spit 'em out
Any of 'em survive
Shit
Two tons of metal 200 miles an hour  flesh and bone and plain old Newton..
They all princess died
Well I'd guestimate it's a sex thing
The only way I can figure it
Highvelocity impact  twisted metal busted glass  all four souls taken exactly at the same time
Yeah I think the only thing we can dream of getting that bastard on  is vehicular manslaughter for the hitchhiker in the death box
That was just plain old goddamn reckless endangerment
Now on paper it's gonna look like he's just trying to help her out
I mean that's the way the jury's gonna see it
So what are you gonna do Pop
Well I can take it upon myself to work the case you know  in my off hours
Search for evidence you know to prove my theory
Alert authorities
Wherever he goes I go
Or I can spend  the same goddamn amount of time and energy  following the NASCAR circuit
Hmm
I thought about it a lot
I think I'd have a hell of lot happier life if I did the latter
If he ever does it again  I can make goddamn sure he don't do it in Texas

Who's in whose room
He's in mine
And so what happened then
That was pretty much it
We made out in the hall for about 10 minutes and then I sent him off to his room
Mmm he's damn good
He's got them mushy lips and fingertips
Mmm I love them mushy lips
Then he takes his big hand and he puts it on my throat  tilts my head back and leans over me  kisses me from behind
Damn that sounds sexy
But then that was it
You sent him off
How'd he take it
Wait a minute
If I'm gonna power through and pick up Zoë at the airport  I need a bigass cup of coffee
Since you're getting that  can you get some more vodka and some more sugarfree Red Bull
We didn't know you were awake
I'm not awake
I'm asleep
And some Red Apple Tans
Damn
I didn't stop to get you bitches groceries
You remember how to get to the airport don't you
Uhhuh
Well then you should get behind the wheel  'cause you gonna drive
Motherfuckers
They got regular Red Bull and sugarfree G.O

The Circle A clerk has this month's issue of Italian Vogue
No way
Way
I can't believe a fucking Circle A carries Italian Vogue
It doesn't
It's his own personal copy
Twentyseven bucks
We're talking about fucking per diem here
Look we found an issue of Italian Vogue in Lebanon Tennessee
We're lucky he's not asking for fucking Krugerrands
I'm getting it and we're splitting it three ways
What me you and Kim
No Kim doesn't give a shit about Italian Vogue
But Brandy will come in with us and if she won't Tysla her sister will
Okay
And I'm not talking fucking Kinko's here either okay
You take it to the art department you have them do it fucking right
♪ La la ♪  ♪ La la ♪  ♪ La la la la la la la la ♪  ♪ La la ♪  You guys are good
Oh my God
That's it
♪ La la la la ♪  Oh boy
Your timing couldn't be better Zoë
Fucking hell
How does that happen
Well I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup and she's off for the next three days  there's no stunts being filmed during that time so Kim's free  and Lee's on a "will notify" for the next four days
Great
We're having the best time
The director Cecil Evans is so much fun
Hell yeah
The next job after this one is definitely gonna suck
So let's hear it ladies
Set romances
Who's getting it off
That would be Lee and Toolbox
Name sounds promising
He's a grip
Well he just keeps sounding better and better
What's his perversion
He likes to watch me pee
PISSING
Yeah but not no more
Now she's getting it on with The Rock
You're having one off with The Rock
Not the real Rock
He's this electrician named Bruce
And Kim started calling him The Rock 'cause he kind of looks like The Rock  so now we all just call him The Rock
This is an allstar crew
We got a guy who looks like Nick Cage  and a guy who looks like Peewee Herman too
Kim dick department
Let's hear it
No dick this trip
I got a man
How long have you had this boyfriend
Who'd you steal him from
Nobody
Kim
Wha... What
All of Kim's boyfriends start out as somebody else's boyfriend
I did not steal him
I didn't steal any of them
They just... jumped ship
Oh Abbie's got the big kahuna
I had a set crush on Cecil
Set crush
Nigga please
You were his set wife
"Were" and "had" being the key words here
Yeah well if he's so in love with me  then whey did he fuck Daryl Hannah's standin
Yes men are dogs
Oh it's so funny
Oh it's so funny
Oh stop acting all hurt
Yeah he's a standin fucker
Bitch you need to get over that shit
That was two weeks ago
Oh well now that you put it like that
Oh I haven't told you the best part
He fucked her on my birthday
Oh that's a horse of a different color
Did he know it was your birthday
He's the director
He's kind of busy
He ate a piece of my birthday cake and he got me a present
Well what did he get you
He made me a tape
Yeah
Wait
He made you a tape
Yeah
Oh that is so romantic
Yes
That sounds like the test of true love to me
Look I know you guys like him
He's likable but he fucked another woman on my birthday
How can you not be on my side
Well I admit that sounds bad
It is bad
Were you two fucking
Hell no
Hello
Is your name Abernathy
The answer to your question is no of course not
What do you mean "No of course not"
And if you fuck Cecil you don't become one of his girlfriends
Not to say I want to be his girlfriend  but if I did want to be his girlfriend  if I fucked him I wouldn't be his girlfriend
I'd be one of his regulars
And I'm just getting too fucking old for that shit
Yes
I've let him give me a foot massage  and when we go to the movies I've let him hold my hand
Bitch you might be acting like you 12 years old  but he just acting like a man
You need to break that nigga off a piece
You're not fucking him...  Mmmm
You're not sucking him...  Mmmm
You're not giving him any tongue but Daryl Hannah's standin is
Okay can we just take my sex life off the table
Actually uh it was Cecil's sex life that was on the table and your lack of one
Ohhh
Before you can claim a nigga you got to claim a nigga  and you can start by giving that motherfucker a hand job  in the back of the van on Tuesday
I'm not gonna do that
I know you won't
But you know who will
The bitch that ends up living in that bigass mansion of his
Now I gotta say I haven't entirely agreed with everything Kim said but it is true:  If you stretch shit out like you have with Cecil  and you suddenly get dirty on them  it blows their mind
Three Kicks to the Head Part Three
And admittedly we're a little fuckedup
Cheers to that
Word
Cheers
So Zoë  the genius  wants to take a picture of me
So she's got her camera and keeps saying  "Step back a little" so I do
Then "A little further" so I step back a little further
Then "A little more" so I do
Then I realize I'm right at the edge  of a sevenfoot concrete ditch  with God knows how many rocks and broken bottles and rats in it  and if I fell in that fucking thing I'd probably would've broken my fucking neck
So I'm yelling at her "Zoë you almost killed me!
Nice
Nice
Thank you
Thank you
I remember taking a step and looking down
Just as I'm thinking "There's that ditch Abbie was talking about"  bam I'm in the fucking ditch you know
What with Zoë the cat
Nothing
If I fell in that fucking thing  they would've had to helicopter me out of there
Zoë just lands on her feet
But then later I started feeling a little bad about myself
We're laughing about it
If I fell in that fucking thing  I probably would've been fucking paralyzed
Oh honey you can't think like that
You know we all have our individual talents  and that just happens to be one of Zoë's
Well...  physically speaking Zoë is amazing
I mean agility reflexes nimbleness
There's few human beings that can fuck with Zoë on that front
Having said that  before you get too envious of Zoë's prowess  you're missing the most important part of that story
You didn't fall in the ditch Zoë did
Zoë even knew there was a ditch there because you told her  and she still fell in
We all have our talents
Hey I resemble that remark
So Kim you still pack a roscoe
Check it out bitch
Ooh nice one mate
What's a roscoe
A roscoe is a pistol
You carry a gun
Uhhuh
You have a license to carry it
Yeah
Oh I didn't know you were..
Okay I didn't say it all right
Stop looking at me
I didn't say it
God
Now do I approve
No
Do I know
Yes
Look I don't know what futuristic utopia you live in  but the world I live in a bitch need a gun
You can't get around the fact that people who carry guns  tend to get shot more than people who don't
Don't do your laundry at midnight
Fuck that
I wanna do my laundry whenever the fuck I wanna do my laundry
Pepper spray
Uh motherfucker try to rape me I don't wanna give him a skin rash
I wanna shut that nigga down
How about a knife at least
Yeah
You know what happens to motherfuckers carry knives
They get shot
I'll hire me a dodirt nigga and he'll carry the gun
And when shit goes down I'll sit back and laugh
But until that day it's wild West motherfucker
So Zoë you thought about what you want to do first
Oh really
And what would that be
To me there's no point in being in America  unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car
Fuck me swinging balls out
Um well I guess we can talk to Transpo
But does it have to be a Dodge Challenger
Not just that
It has to be a 1970 Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine
No worries mate
I've got it all worked out
When I knew I was coming here I went online and found out  that the local paper here in Tennessee is the Lebanon News Sentinel
I'm sorry
Where's home
Australia right
What do you mean by that mate
Zoë's from New Zealand and you never..
That is unless you want your ass kicked
I really am
Oh it's okay
We're just taking the piss out of you mate
Anyway I subscribed to the local paper a month ago
Now why the fuck you want a local redneck newspaper in New Zealand
Pipe down and I'll tell you
I've been getting the paper for the last month  and I've been checking the classified at the back looking at cars for sale
And you wanna buy it
Kim I may be stupid but I'm not bloody stupid
I wanna say I wanna buy it so he'll let me testdrive it
A 1970 Dodge Challenger with a white paint job
Kowalski from Vanishing Point
Mate it's a fucking classic
Mmm I get it
If I can get this guy to let me drive it without him  I will blow the doors off that bitch
Oh God
"What's Vanishing Point?
Abs I'm supposed to be the illiterate one
It's just one of the best American movies ever made
Actually Zoë most girls wouldn't know Vanishing Point
Excuse me
"Most girls"
What the fuck are you two
Of course we watched it
Y'all grew up watching that Pretty in Pink shit
What so you didn't watch John Hughes movies
Of course I did
I'm a girl
But I also watched car shit too
Mmhmm
Gone in 60 Seconds..
The real one not that Angelina Jolie bullshit
We have an outdoors theater in Auckland
What do you horny gals want
Hey you got a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale
This shit is off the fucking hook
Fucking legendary mate
Sweet ass
Well if you'll excuse me for a moment  I'd just like to have a word alone with my business associate
You ladies take your time
Okay
Mmm
What are you waiting for
I..
I intend to but first I need to ask you something
What
Oh hell no
Would you keep it down
For Christ sakes...   Don't blaspheme
Sorry
Now what did you say after the last time
Look I know what I said...  What did you say
I know I said we shouldn't do this again...  No
You didn't say we shouldn't
Yeah but...  "But" my ass
You said not only are we never gonna play ship's mast again  but you also said if you ever do what you trying to do now  to not only refuse but that I had permission  to physically restrain your ass if necessary
Well...  No no no no
Answer the question motherfucker
Did you or did you not say that
Yes I said that
However...  Whatever with your "however.
Look I know I said it and I know I meant it..
Damn skippy you meant it
Really..
I meant we should never play ship's mast again  in New Zealand or Australia
You are such a liar
Look I know what I said when I said it
But when I said it I didn't know I'd ever come to America
And when I said it if I had known I was going to come to America  and had the opportunity to play ship's mast  with a fucking Vanishing Point Challenger  I would've added a "however.
Okay oddly enough I actually understood that
However just because you talked yourself into some stupid shit  doesn't mean I have lost my goddamn mind
You need two people to play ship's mast and I ain't playing
I'll be your best friend
I don't need me no best friend lives on the other side of planet Earth
I'll crack your back
Well of course I'll crack it anyway
Whenever you want it you got it
You don't even have to ask for it
You just order me to do it
Just be like...  "Bitch get over here and get busy.
You crack my back you'll give me foot massages...  Mmhmm
Mmm
And after a shower you put moisturizer on my butt
So we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him
What
I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him..
I heard what you said
You know you two got some fucking balls
What
Don't play dumbass with me
I've been up all night
I should be in my hotel room asleep not fucking around here on Tobacco Road
But because Zoë wanted to drive some fucking Vanishing Point car I'm here
Now you two got the balls to ask me... no scratch that...  tell me I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad  while the cool kids get to go out and play
Bullshit on that
It ain't like that
Then what's it like Kim
You guys are our collateral
I really think one human being will be collateral enough
You're not gonna wanna do what we're doing
What drive a car
Mmm
We're doing more than that
We're doing more than that
Actually we're paying you a compliment  'cause we gonna do some stupid shit
But that's okay
We're stunt people
How do you know I don't wanna do it
'Cause you're a mom
Yeah
You know we're supposed to be this big posse  but that's the excuse you guys use  whenever you want to exclude me from something
So what is it you two daredevils are doing that I'm just so uncool  I couldn't possibly understand
You know we're kind of conning this guy  so maybe it's best that we don't go into detail about it while he's watching us
Okay
How about this
I'll talk him into it
How you gonna do that
Eh that's my problem
But don't worry
He'll say yes
What are you gonna do blow him
No
I'm gonna insinuate that Lee's gonna blow him
Not really
But let me handle it
We got a deal
Okay Mommy listen up
We take you along you don't say shit
You don't even say crap
You just sit in the back and I don't wanna hear  a peep out of your ass you understand
Got it
You start nagging us we're pulling over to the side of the road  kicking your ass out and picking you up later
Agreed
Okay
Hello sir
Hello
What's your name
Jasper
Hello Jasper
I'm Abernathy
Abernathy
What's your first name
That is my first name
What kind of first name is that
You know what
Just call me Abbie
Okay Abbie
You know just to see if we're comfortable in it
Why would I do something stupid like that
How do I know y'all ain't just gonna steal it
Four reasons actually
One we're not thieves
Two that would be rude
Three we're staying at the Days Inn in town
We're registered for the next month
Actually Zoë's not
But Kim and I are so we're totally trackdownable
Who's Kim
The colored girl
Kim would be the girl of color
And reason number four and the most important  while we're taking the car out for a little spin  that'll give you a better opportunity to get acquainted  with our other friend Lee
Why does she look kind of familiar
That would be because she's a famous actress
Why is she dressed like that
What's a cheerleader movie
A movie about cheerleaders
Is it a porno movie
Yes it is
But don't mention it
She's shy
Lee this is Jasper
Hey goodlookin' be back to pick you up later

I think I'm thinking it

Who's that stumblin' around in the dark
State your business or prepare to get winged
Calm yourselves gentlemen
I mean you no harm
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler
Whoa boy
Good cold evening gentlemen
Might that be you
Who wants to know
I'm Dr. King Schultz
This is my horse Fritz
What kinda doctor
Now are you the Speck Brothers
And did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction
So what
So I wish to parley with you
Speak English
[chuckles] Oh I'm sorry
It is a second language
Now amongst your inventory I've been led to believe  is a specimen I'm keen to acquire
Is there one amongst you who was formerly a resident  of the Carrucan plantation
Who said that
What's your name
Django
Then you are exactly the one I'm looking for
Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are
Who are they
Ellis
Roger
Sometime they call him Lil Raj
Not anymore
Tell me...  ...if you were to see any of these three gentlemen again   would you recognize them
[man] Hey
Stop talkin' to him like that
Like What
My good man I'm simply trying to ascertain..
Speak English goddamn it
I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction
I don't care
No sale
Of course they're for sale
Move it
My good man did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture  or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention
Last chance fancy pants
Oh very well
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast  but I didn't want you to do anything rash  before you had a moment to come to your senses
You shot Roscoe
I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me
And I do believe I have... one two three four...  ...five witnesses who can attest to that fact
Damn leg's busted
No doubt
[man] Godfuckin'damn it
As I was saying...  ...if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again you could recognize 'em
Yeah
Sold American
Mr. Speck
How much for young Django here
That iron is nasty business
Oh could you hold this for a moment
Thank you
Get up on that horse
Also if I were you  I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind
Nigger
Don't you touch my brother's coat
Goddamn it
One hundred... ten... 20...  ...and five...  ...for young Django here
And since he won't be needing it anymore  I'd like to purchase your brother's nag
Do you have one
You go to hell dentist
[scoffs]  I thought not
No worries
I come prepared
Thank you
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale
Now as to you poor devils
So as I see it when it comes to the subject of what to do next  you gentlemen have two choices
One: Once I'm gone you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck  then carry him to the nearest town
Which would be at least 37 miles back the way you came
Or two: You could unshackle yourselves take that rifle  put a bullet in his head bury the two of them deep  and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country
Oh and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you  the North Star is that one
Tata
Let's talk about this
[lantern crashing]  [chains rattling]  You gotta be reasonable in a situation like this
I'm just doin' my job
Blueberry didn't I give you my last apple
Tell you what boys: Take me to the doc in El Paso   I'll get you your freedom
[gun cocking]   No
No please...  [gunshot echoing]    All right now
I'd like you to take two of these tonight...   [coughing]  ...and then in the morning...  That's a nigger on a horse
What's everybody staring at
They ain't never seen no nigger on a horse before
Good morning innkeeper
Two beers for two weary travelers
It's still a bit early
By then we'll be servin' breakfast
the hell you think you're doing boy
Get that nigger outta here
[panting] Help
Help
Alas
Now we must act as our own bartender
Sit down my boy
What kind of dentist are you
But these days I practice a new profession...  ...bounty hunter
Do you know what a bounty hunter is
No
Well...  ...the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash  a bounty hunter deals in corpses
Prost
The state places a bounty on a man's head
I track that man I find that man I kill that man
Sometimes that's easier said than done
I show that corpse to the authorities proving yes indeed  I truly have killed him  at which point the authorities pay me the bounty
So like slavery it's a flesh for cash business
What's a bounty
You kill people
Certain people yeah
Bad people
Ah
Badder they are bigger the reward
And I must admit I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you
On one hand I despise slavery
On the other hand I need your help
If you're not in a position to refuse all the better
So for the time being I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey  work to my benefit
Still having said that I feel guilty
So I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers
But you do
Don't ya
Good
So here's my agreement
You travel with me until we find them
Where we goin'
I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg  but I don't know where
That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find 'em
You do that I agree to give you your freedom  $25 per Brittle Brother
That's $75
And as if on cue here comes the sheriff
OK boys
Come on out
[overlapping chatter]  All right folks calm down
Go about your business
Now why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble
You ain't got nothing better to do  than to come into Bill Sharp's town  and show your ass
[metal springing noise]  [sheriff screaming]   [crowd gasping]  [groaning]    What'd you just do to our sheriff
[groaning]   [yelling]  [shot echoing]    Now you can get the marshal
Should we wait inside
Can we just leave
After you
I want six men six rifles behind it
I want two men two rifles up on this roof
All the barrels aimed at that front door
Somebody get poor Bill outta the goddamn street
You in the saloon
We got a hundred rifles aimed at every way out of that buildin'
You got one chance to get out of this alive
You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head  and I mean right now
Yes it is
This is U.S
Marshal Gill Tatum
Na wunderbar marshal
I have relieved myself of all weapons  and just as you have instructed  I am ready to step outside  with my hands raised above my head
You mean like you did our sheriff
Shot him down like a dog in the street
Yes that's exactly what I mean
Do I have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street
Fair enough marshal
They're a little tense out there
So don't make any quick movements and let me do the talking
[doors squeaking open]  Come ahead
You unarmed
Marshal Tatum may I address you and your deputies  and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey  as to the incident that just occurred
Go on
Thank you
Like yourself marshal I'm a servant of the court
The man lying dead in the dirt who the good people of Daughtrey  saw fit to elect as their sheriff who went by the name of Bill Sharp  is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck  with a price on his head of $200
The hell you say
I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news
But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff  sometime in the past two years
Yeah
years ago he was rustling cattle  from the B.C
Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock Texas
You're encouraged to wire him
He'll back up who I am and who your dear departed sheriff was
In other words marshal you owe me $200
After this Brittle business is behind us  you'll be a free man with a horse $75 in your back pocket...  What's your plan after that
Find my wife and buy her freedom
Django I had no idea you were a married man
Do most slaves believe in marriage
Oh me and my wife do
Old Man Carrucan didn't
Django Django  You got sand Django
Boy's got sand
I got no use for a nigger with sand
And the girl too
And I want you to take 'em to the Greenville auction and sell 'em
Both of 'em
And this one...  ...you will sell him cheap
In Greenville...  ...there should be some sort of a records office
You know when she was sold...  ...you know where she came from  and you know her name
What is her name
Broomhilda
Broomhilda
Broomhilda
Hmmm
Were her owners German
She wasn't born on the Carrucan plantation
She was raised by a German mistress the Von Shafts
She speak a little German too
Hmmm
When she was little her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody  to speak German with
Well let me get this straight
Your slave wife speaks German and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft
Yep
They call me Hildi
You'll be playing a character
Hm
No
Do you understand
Yeah
Don't break character
And your character is that of The Valet
What that is
Hmmm
And now Django you may choose your character's costume
Youse gonna let me pick out my own clothes
But of course
resumes playing]  Whoa
It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory
My valet does not walk
I said niggers on horses...  [Schultz] His name is Django
He's a free man
He can ride what he pleases
Not on my property
My good sir perhaps we got off on the wrong boot
Allow me to unring this bell
My name is Dr. King Schultz
And these are our horses Tony and Fritz
[snorting]  [women giggling]  Mr. Bennett
I've been led to believe that you are a gentleman and a businessman
I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee  to buy one of my nigger gals
No appointment no nothin'
Well what if I was to say I don't like you
Or your fancypants nigger
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn
Now what you got to say about that
Mr. Bennett
If you are the businessman I've been led to believe you to be  I have 5000 things I might say that could change your mind
Hmmm
Oh maybe while we discuss business  you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures  to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds
Oh well absolutely
Yessir Big Daddy
Uh...  What's your Jimmie's name again
<i>'</i> Django
<i>'</i> Django
Betina sugar could you take Django there  and take him around the grounds here and show him all the pretty stuff
As you please Big Daddy
He cannot be treated like a slave
Understood Schultz
Betina sugar
Yes'm
Django isn't a slave
Django is a free man you understand
You can't treat him like any of the other niggers around here  'cause he ain't like any of the other niggers around here
You want I should treat him like white folks
No
That's not what I said
Then I don't know what you want Big Daddy
Yes I can see that
Uh...  What's the name of that peckerwood boy from town that works with the glass
That's the boy's name
Jerry
You know Jerry don't you sugar
Yes'm Big Daddy
Well that's it then
You just treat him like you would Jerry
Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big
That there is the pantry
That's where Big Daddy hang all his dead meat
Po' little squirrels
What you do for your massa
So you really free
You mean you wanna dress like that
Betina I need to ask you somethin'
What you want
I'm lookin' for three white men
Three brothers
Overseers
You know 'em
Brittle
Yes Brittle
I don't know them
They could be usin' a different name
They woulda come to the plantation this past year
You mean the Shaffers
Three brothers
Uhhuh
They here
Could you point one of 'em out to me
Well one's over in that field
gonna appreciate this now
She work in the house John
Now your Bible say...  that I was one that made her do it
You ready
She didn't wanna run off with me
If anybody should be gettin' whupped now  it should be me
It should be me John
Now I been here long enough you know me you know me a long time now
You know Massa Carrucan ain't gonna appreciate this
She a house slave she can't be...  [screaming]    On my knees
I'm asking you this please
I'm keeping it funny for you
Now John please
L's on my knees John
Is that who you was lookin' for
Yep
Where the other two at
They by the stable punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs
Point me in that direction
You go to that tree and keep goin' thata way
Go get that white man I came here with
[man] Come on now
No no please
[shrieks] Please
Come on
Get you set up now
[screaming]  "And the Lord said 'The fear of ye..."   [cracking]  "...and the dread of ye  shall be on every beast of the earth."
Come here now woman
[screaming]  OK she's ready
And after this we'll see if you break eggs again
John Brittle
You remember me
[metal springing noise]  I like the way you die boy
Keep it funny
No
[groans]   Who were they
That's Big John and that's Lil Raj
Where's Ellis
He's the one hightailin' it across that field right now
You sure that's him
Yeah
Positive
You don't know if you're positive
I don't know what "positive" mean
It means you're sure
"Yes" what
I'm positive he dead
Django
Everybody calm down
We mean no one else any harm
Who are you two jokers
The man to my left is Django Freeman
He's my deputy
In my pocket is a warrant  signed by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas  for the arrest and capture dead or alive  of John Brittle Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle
They were goin' by the name Shaffer
You know them by the name of Shaffer but the butchers' real name was Brittle
These are wanted men
The law wants 'em for murder
Now may I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it
Gimme
Satisfied
May I have that back please
Get off my land
Posthaste
Yeah that's them sonsabitches
[dramatic choral music]  [horses snorting whinnying]   Come on men
[man 2] Heehaw
Now unless they start shootin' first nobody shoot 'em
That's way too simple for these jokers
We're gonna whup that niggerlover to death
And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself
Damn
I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing
We ready or what
[fabric ripping]  Oh... Oh shit
I just made it worse
Willard's wife
Well make your own goddamn masks
Look nobody's sayin' they don't appreciate what Jenny did
Well if all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag  I coulda cut it better than this
What about you Robert
Not too good
I mean if I don't move my head I can see you pretty good more or less
But when I start ridin' the bag's movin' all over and I'm ridin' blind
Shit
[man] Yeah
Oh God
Anybody bring any extra bags
I'm just askin'
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride
Oh well shitfire
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up that just defeats the purpose
Well I can't see in this fuckin' thing
Well fuck all y'all
I'm goin' home
Now I watched my wife work all day gettin' 30 bags together  for you ungrateful sonsabitches  and all I can hear is criticize criticize criticize
From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'
We got a killer nigger over that hill there
And we gotta make a lesson out of him
OK I'm confused
I think we all think the bag was a nice idea
Yeah
[mumbling agreements]  But not pointin' any fingers they coulda been done better
So how 'bout no bags this time  but next time we do the bags right and then we go full regalia
I like that idea a lot
Wait a minute
I didn't say no bags
But nobody can see
So
So it'd be nice to see
This is a raid
I can't see you can't see
All that matters is can the fuckin' horse see
That's a raid
[overlapping shouts]  [man] Sons of bitches
out from under that wagon
And get that niggerlover outta the wagon
That nigger ain't down here Big Daddy
They tricked us
Well where are they
Auf Wiedersehen
[all shouting]  [horses whinnying]  Oh
[chuckles]  Bull'seye
[all shouting]  Yeah cowards tend to do that
Goddamn it
Would you care to
He's getting away
I got him
Big Daddy's getting away
I got him
[slowmotion impact sound]  [Big Daddy grunting]  Got him
How you know Broomhilda's first masters was German
Broomhilda is a German name
If they named her it stands to reason they'd be German
Broomhilda is the name of a character  in the most popular of all the German legends
There's a story about Broomhilda
Oh yes there is
Oh every German knows that story
Well Broomhilda was a princess
She was a daughter of Wotan god of all gods
Anyway her father is really mad at her
What she do
I can't exactly remember
She disobeys him in some way
So he puts her on top of the mountain
Broomhilda's on a mountain
And he puts a firebreathing dragon there to guard the mountain
And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire
Unless a hero arises brave enough to save her
Does a fella arise
Yes Django as a matter of fact he does
A fella named Siegfried
Does Siegfried save her
Quite spectacularly so
And he walks through hellfire...  ...because Broomhilda's worth it
I know how he feel
I think I'm just starting to realize that
Now look Django..
...I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love...  ...but I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscience
A slave auction town in Mississippi isn't the place for you to visit
But let me ask you a question
How do you like the bounty hunting business
Kill white folks and they pay you for it
What's not to like
Now I have to admit we make a good team
I thought you was mad at me for killin' Big John and Lil Raj
What you mean "partner up"
You work with me through the winter till the snow melts..
...I give you a third of my bounties
So we make some money this winter and when the snow melts  I'll take you to Greenville myself  and we'll find where they sent your wife
Why you care what happen to me
Why you care if I find my wife
...I've never given anybody their freedom before
And now that I have I feel vaguely responsible for you
As a German I'm obliged to help you on your quest  to rescue your beloved Broomhilda
Ooh
What happened to Mr. "I Wanna Shoot White Folks For Money"
His son's with him
Well good
He'll have a loved one with him
Maybe even share a last word
That's better than most of them get
Put down the rifle
Don't worry I'm not mad at you
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill
Consider that today's lesson
Dead or alive
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall   [Schultz] Gang
"Gang.
"For murder and stagecoach...  ...robbery
Sevenzerozerozero

Seven thousand
Thousand
$1500 for each of his...  .“gang“P   Mem...  "Members
Known members of the Smitty Bacall Gang are as follas:"   Follows
"Dandy Michaels Gerald Nash and..."  Crazy Craig Koons
That is who Smitty Bacall is
If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22  they would never have printed that
Do you want to save your wife by doing what I do
This is what I do
I kill people and sell their corpses for cash
This corpse is worth $7000
Now quit your pussyfooting and shoot him
Pa
Pa
Why
It's good luck
You always keep the handbill of your first bounty
That's accurate
Who the hella you got there
Who the hell is the WilsonLowe Gang
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes
Huh
Well just leave 'em out here they ain't going nowhere
Why don't you come in then out of the snowy snow  and get yourselves some coffee
We had a birthday yesterday
Pretty good
Move it boy
Get on up on that auction block
Don't let that mud slow you down
Keep goin'
"Broomhilda Von Shaft
'R' on right cheek.
Calvin Candie
He owns the fourth biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi: Candyland
Candyland
Oh so you've heard of it
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland
Well apparently that's where your wife is...   [sighs]  ...and that's the repellant gentleman  who owns her
Oh no she ain't no field nigger
She... she pretty
And she talk good too
[sizzling]  [screaming]  She ain't no field nigger but she ain't good enough  for the house no more either
What's a comfort...
Oh
Not while I got freedom
Not while I got my gun
So do we offer to buy her
So...  ...say...  ...a man wants to buy a horse
Needs to buy a horse
And do you know what the farmer says
The farmer says no
Well I say fuck that farmer and I'm stealin' that horse
Fair enough
But now you're a horse thief and they hang horse thieves
We need her and we need a bill of sale
May I offer an alternative plan of action
Go ahead
So... the man walks up to the farmer's farm  he knocks on the farmer's door...  ...and asks not to buy the horse but the farm
We gonna offer to buy Candyland
No it's far too big
But apparently this farmer ain't all about the farm
How much do you know about Mandingo fighting
What
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone  who is an expert on Mandingo fighting
Why
"</i>  Bonjour
We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie
<i>Entraz.</i>   Thank you
Hmmm
Ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver
A black slaver is lower than the head house nigger...  ...and buddy that's pretty fuckin' low
Then play him that way
Give me your black slaver
Toot
Good to see you again
Mr. Moguy
Thank you for your assistance in creating the opportunity   for this appointment
Nonsense it's my job
Yes this is Django Freeman
Django this is Mr. Candie's lawyer Leonide Moguy
Just call me Leo
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room
You all wanna follow me
associated with Mr. Candie
were about 11  when we went to boarding school together
Calvin's father's father put me through law school
One could almost say youse a nigger
What did you say
Nothing he's just being cheeky
Uh anything else about Mr. Candie that I should know before I meet him
Yes he is a bit of a Francophile
What civilized people aren't
He doesn't speak French
Don't speak French to him it'll embarrass him
Turn around
There you go
Why do you want to get in the Mandingo business
You don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions
Answer the question
The awful truth
I'm bored
This seems like a good bit of fun
Well come on over
We got us a fight goin' on that's a good bit of fun
You don't wear a hat in the house white man
Even I know that
Dr. Schultz
What a rare pleasure
Keep fighting niggers
And I might add an honor
Please have a seat the pleasure's all mine
Get free man Django here whatever he wants
And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon
[man yelling]  [grunting]  use your weight
He's much bigger and stronger
He's not doing what I told him for God's sakes
Come on now boy
It's a fight to the death
[grunting]  You either hit him or are you ain't
Big Fred come on
Use your strength
There you go
See I told you to put some more power in there
Do what I told you boy
There you go
[bones cracking]   No
Blind him black boy
Blind him black
Oh no Luigi
[screaming]   Whoo
[screaming]  Oh...   [panting]  [man continues screaming]    Finish him
Go on boy finish him

Worth every penny
Well arrivederci Luigi
Come on up now boy
You did a fine job
A real fine job
Tequila
What's your name
Django
Can you spell it
DJANGO
The D is silent
take care of my new boy here
You find him a room with a soft bed  then you bring him up a pony to lick his pole
Yessir Monsieur Candie
Before you go Roscoe get Fred here a tall beer
You enjoy that boy
You've earned it
What's your name boy
His name is Django Freeman
Where'd you dig him up
A fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together
I've heard tell about you
I heard you been telling everybody them Mandingos ain't no damn good
Ain't nothin' nobody is sellin' is worth buyin'
I'm curious... what makes you such a Mandingo expert
What did you say boy
Calm down Butch
...I'd appreciate if you could direct your line of inquiry toward me
One...  ...you do not have anything to drink
Can I get you a tasty refreshment
Yes
I'll have a beer
Wunderbar
Do not spare the rum
Doc..
You are well you are a neophyte
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this cowboy here is takin' advantage of you
...I didn't seek you out for your advice
I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger  at above topdollar market price
Now I was under the impression when you granted me an audience  it would be to discuss business
Well we weren't talkin' business yet
We were discussin' my curiosity
Thank you
go outside and play
I know you didn't mean me
Prost
German
Now according to Moguy if I do business with you  I'm doing business with both y'all
Is that it
Well you don't make it sound too flattering but more or less yeah
Hm
So..
Not for top dollar
Well then we got nothin' more to talk about
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell
He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell
Well I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell
Well you won't sell your best
You won't even sell your second best
But your third best...
You don't want to sell him either
And what do you consider ridiculous
For a truly talented specimen the right nigger
Twelve thousand dollars
Well gentlemen you had my curiosity  but now you have my attention
Willie
Hold up
Hold up
Ah
Good morning gentlemen
Good Dr. Schultz
Beautiful morning isn't it
Please won't you take a ride with us here in the Victoria
Oh thank you very much
You can tie your horse up back there
Where I part company from many of my phrenologist colleagues  is I believe there is a level above bright above talented  above loyal that a nigger can aspire to
Say one nigger that just pops up in 10000
Bright day huh Bright Boy
Sun is up
Shining on all of us
[Schultz] Thank you
Quite an honor
The honor is all ours
Thank you
Bright Boy you are that one in 10000
The name of the game is keep up not catch up nigger
Whoa
Everybody calm down
Now I saw the whole thing
No harm done
This nigger just..
I said no harm done
Now take your hand off your pistol
Butch that means you too
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest
Hoot
Get back up on your horse
For God's sake somebody please help Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse
[man] Yessir boss
Oh now you are one lucky nigger
Oh I'm gonna go walking in the moonlight with you
You wanna hold my hand
Head 'em out
You got a problem with your eyeball boy
No sir
You want a boot heel in it
No sir
You flash that bad look at me again I'll give you a reason not to like me
Now move nigger
You niggers are gonna understand something about me
I'm worse than any of these white men here
You get the molasses out your ass you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me
[chuckles]  Indeed
You know I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimens at Candyland  so before that moment it would be good if I could have  a confidential strategy meeting with my confidant
You mind telling me what the hell you doing
I confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland
You're sure it's her
He didn't call her by name  but she's a young lady whip marks on her back and speaks German
Now while it's not wise to assume  in this instance I think it's pretty safe
Point being don't get so carried away with your retribution
You lose sight of why we're here
Yes I do
Stop antagonizing Candie
And I for one don't intend to die in Chickasaw County Mississippi USA
I'm not antagonizing him
You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves
I recall the man who had me kill another man in front of his son  and he didn't bat a eye
You remember that
Yeah of course I remember
What you said was that this is my world...  ...and in my world you gotta get dirty
I'm gettin' dirty
Well you're paraphrasing a tad but...  ...that was the general gist
See you at Candyland
That means you too Moonlight
Now boy why do a fool thing like run off
I can't fight no more Monsieur Candie
You might not be able to win but your ass can fight
Mr. Stonesipher would you please shut these goddamn dogs up
I cannot hear myself think
Marsha hush up
Marsha
Hey
Get these goddamn dogs away from this nigger
Come on now boy... get on out that tree
Yessir
How long was he loose
A night
Day
Half the other night
'Bout 20 miles off the prop
Pretty far considering that limp he got
Mr. Moguy who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday
Onea this new lot
Well way he looks now a blind Indian wouldn't bet a bead on him
Candie I ain't got it in me no more
Now now now now now
I can't...  Now no beggin'
You in trouble now son
Yessir
When I pay $500 then I expect to get five fights out of a nigger   'fore he roll over and play dead
Sir
You fought three fights
But I won every one
Yes you did
Yes you did
But that last one you muddled the line between winnin' and losin'
Yessir
Still the fact remains:  I pay $500 I want five goddamn fights
So what about my $500 huh
You gonna reimburse me
You even know what "reimburse" means
I'll reimburse you
You Will
Yep
You'll pay $500  for practically a oneeyed old Joe ain't fit to push a broom
No he won't
Matter of fact so am I
But we ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny
Ain't got no use for him
You heard him
You're gonna have to excuse Mr. Stonesipher's slackjawed gaze
He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life
Ain't that right Mr. Stonesipher
...nor have I
Now...  ...seein' as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here...  ...you won't mind me handlin' this nigger any way I see fit
Mr. Stonesipher
Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven
Marsha
Marsha hey get him
[barks echoing]  Get 'im get 'im
Yeah
Whoo
Whooee
Nah he just ain't used to seein' a man ripped apart by dogs is all
You are used to it
I'm just a little more used to Americans than he is
Hm
Now Monsieur Candie...  ...whenever you're ready
Let's get to it
'Cause as of now if he's an example I ain't impressed
Follow me
Line 'em up to the left here now boy
Get up there

They are mine to burn
Now your problem right now is makin' a good impression
Yessir Monsieur Candie
Go on now
Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in The Big House
Your daddy rollin' over in his goddamned grave
Man the lip on him
He's gettin' worse and worse

[chuckles]  [forced chuckle]  As I look at you now Broomhilda  I can see all the passions you inspire are completely justified
The doctor here speaks German
And I've been informed you do as well
Go ahead girl
Speak a little German
Ha
[laughs]  Astonishing
<i>Ja.</i>   Don't be afraid
Pardon
<i>Danke.</i>    Hey Little Trouble Maker
You silvertongued devil you
Hurry up girl
These ready Miss Cora
No no no they drinkin' tonight
Get your big pretty ass out the way
you knows what I like
Ooh
Come on with these biscuits girl
Look Monsieur Candie they were all fine specimens no doubt about it
But the best three by far were Samson...   What's that other one's name
Goldie
Goldie
By the way why is he called Eskimo Joe
these nigger nicknames get started
His name was Joe maybe one day he said he was cold
Well regardless Samson's your best
We all know that
You will never sell him and I can see why
He's a champion
All three are champions
Samson's the champion
Them other two pretty good
Calvin now what's this nigger you let..
You have to understand Monsieur Candie  while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game  I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus
Is that right
Hence I have big ideas when it comes to presentation
I need something more than just a big nigger
Yeah he needs to have panache
Need to have what
What
Panache
Showmanship yes
I want to be able to bill him as The Black Hercules
The Black Hercules isn't that clever
More like Niggerles
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger per se
But is he right as rain
Oh Dr. Schultz  I will have you know there is no one in the nigger fight game  that appreciates the value of showmanship  more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie here
Nobody
Hmmm
And that is a nigger that can win fights
Now that should be your first second third fourth and fifth concern
Now after you have that and you know you have that  then you can start to implement a grand design
In other words first thing is first
First thing's first
Ooh
Famously
Oh Monsieur Candie you can't imagine what it's like  not to hear your native tongue in four years
Well hell I can't imagine two weeks in Boston
Two weeks in Boston
[coughing]   I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue
And Hildi is a charming conversation companion
Dr. Schultz
You mighta caught yourself   a little dose of nigger love
a powerful emotion boy
[Stephen] Hm
It's like a pool of black tar
Once it catches your ass you're caught
Yessir you stuck
Well naturally
It is the soaring eagle that attracts her attention   not the plucked chicken
[all chuckle]  so down on yourself
you got to put your elbow in these dishes you hear me
You know that nigger don't you
Who
"Who?
You know who I'm talkin' about
At the table
I don't know him
No
"No" what
No sir
You wouldn't lie to me now would you
If you say so
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger no doubt about it
But if it was my money I wouldn't pay no $12000 for him
What would your price be
Well if I was inclined to be generous...  ...and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous...  ...9000
Dr. Schultz let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about
You see it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger
Sure wasn't
It was you who approached me to buy one
Sure was
Now that $9000 figure  Bright Boy's been bandyin' about that ain't too far off from right
And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that   I could do so any day of the week
But like you said in Greenville doctor..
It was only your ridiculous offer of $12000   that made me even consider it
Hmmm
You know Monsieur Candie you do possess the power of persuasion
Monsieur Candie you have a deal
Eskimo Joe $12000
[banging table] Hooray doctor
Hooray
However that is a tremendous amount of money
Persnickety man named Tuttle
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract  before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh
Hmmm
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined   by a physician of my choosing
[Calvin] Naturally
So say I return in about...   ...five days time
With my Mr. Tuttle
I say splendid doctor
Splendid
Gentlemen...  ...may I propose a toast
To Eskimo Joe
[all chuckling]  To The Black Hercules
To The Black Hercules
You was right doctor
That name do have panass
[chuckles]  Hm
So Hildi how you like servin' at the big table in The Big House huh
When Monsieur Candie talk to you you answers
I like it a lot Monsieur Candie
It's a lot better than sizzlin' in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass  through a bramble bush
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos   huh sugar bear
Oh Lord she like them niggers
Sure do
Like Samson
You know Monsieur Candie  the doctor here might be interested in seein' Hildi's peeled back  seein' as how they don't have many niggers where he come from
Dr. Schultz when you was alone with Hildi here  did you just speak German or did you get to take her clothes off
No we just talked and...  haven't seen her back
I haven't...  No no no no
Stephen's right you might find this interesting
Hildi go on take off your dress
Go on
[Lara Lee] Uh Calvin
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf
They don't got niggers there
He is a man of medicine
These niggers are tough Dr. Schultz no doubt about it
Hildi's got somethin' like four lashes on her back
Lara Lee just get one she'd lose her goddamn mind
[Stephen] Sure would
[Calvin] Look at that doctor
It's like a paintin'
Look at that
We are eating
[exhales]  Fine
Fine fine fine fine
After dinner then Stephen
After dinner
During the brandies gentlemen hm
[Lara Lee] She a mess
Yes ma'am
[gasps] Oh
I just got you done up
Come on in here
Baby you on Stephen bad side and you need to be on his blind side
You say you ain't know him
Huh
I said you said you ain't know him
I don't
Mr. Stephen..
...I don't
Why is you lying to me
I ain't
Then why is you crying
Why is I'm scaring you
Because you scary
that warms my heart to hear that
You stay right here
you'd be willing to part with Hildi
Whyyes
Yessiree bob I did
In that case allow me to propose another proposition
Hurry up goddamn it
Monsieur Candie...  [Calvin] Stephen
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here
Excuse him
Monsieur Candie could I get a word with you in the kitchen
You mean get up out of my chair
Why
It's about dessert
I'd rather discuss that in private
We're having white cake
What sort of melodrama could be brewing back there
You right Monsieur Candie
You right
I'll handle it myself
Shit get fucked up around here you blame me
Fine
Fine
Yessir
Well gentlemen as you can see  talented as they are no doubt in the kitchen  from time to time adult supervision is required
If you'll excuse me a moment
the dinner service
Hurry up girl
So Dr. Schultz why don't you regale us with a tale of the circus
What is the matter
They wants that girl
[chuckling]  Stephen what the hell are you talking about
Hm
They playing your ass for a fool is what I'm talking about
They ain't here for no musclebound Jimmie
Wh... What girl
Hildi
Yeah Hildi
Her and Django them niggers know each other
Did he give you any money
No
Not yet
But...  Then he ain't bought diddly
Not yet nohow
But he's just about to buy  who he come here to buy when I interrupted him
"Thank you Stephen.
Where you gettin' all this
Why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger  with a chewed up back ain't worth $300
They doin' it 'cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi
She probably his wife
You wouldn't pay no never mind to no $300
But that 12000
That made you real friendly now didn't it
Yes it did
His wife huh
If it had been a snake it would have bit me
Those lying...  ...goddamn timewastin' sons of bitches
Sons of bitches
Oh there you are
I was beginning to think that you and that old crow run off together
That'd be a hell of a note wouldn't it
Billy Crash is out there dealing with some shady slaver  trying to sell a passel of ponies
Would you be a dear go out there and give them gals an eyeball
Of course brother
Thank you darling
Yeah
Business never sleeps
Apropos before your exit  we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda
Ah yes
Yes we were doctor
And we will again
Who's your little friend
This is Ben
He's a old Joe that lived around here for a long time
And I do mean a long damn time
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...  ...and my daddy's daddy
Growing up the son of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi  puts a white man in contact with a whole lotta black faces
I spent my whole life here right here in Candyland...  ...surrounded by black faces
[laughs]  Now right out there on that porch three times a week for 50 years  Old Ben here would shave my daddy with a straight razor
Now if I was Old Ben I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat  and it wouldn't have taken me no 50 years to do it neither
But he never did
Why not
You see the science of phrenology  is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species
In the skull of the African here  the area associated with submissiveness  is larger than any human or any other subhuman species on planet Earth
If you examine...  ...this piece of skull here...  ...you will notice three distinct dimples
Here here and here
But this is the skull of Old Ben
Now Bright Boy..
...I will admit you are pretty clever
But if I took this hammer here...  ...and I bashed in your skull with it...  ...you would have the same three dimples in the same place...  ...as Old Ben
Hey
If you lift those palms off that turtle shell tabletop  Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawedoff
There have been a lot of lies said around this dinner table here tonight  but that you can believe
Mr. Moguy would you be so kind as to collect the pistol  hanging off these boys' hips here
Thank you ever so much
Doctor
Jackass
Ah yes
Am I right
Right
Bring out Hildi
Get over there yonder
[screams]  Sit your ass in that goddamn...  flat on that tabletop
To which me myself said "What is your definition of ridiculous?
To which you said "$12000.
[yells]  Now considering y'all  have ridden a whole lot of miles  went through a whole lot of trouble and done spread a whole lot of bull  to purchase this lovely lady right here  it would appear that Broomhilda is in fact... the right nigger
And if y'all want to leave Candyland with Broomhilda  the price is $12000
Yes I do doctor
You see under the laws of Chickasaw County  Broomhilda here is my property
And I can choose to do with my property whatever I so desire
And if y'all think my price...  ...for this nigger here is too steep...   [grunts]  ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...  ...take this goddamn hammer here and beat her ass to death with it
Right in front of both y'all
Then we can examine the three dimples inside Broomhilda's skull
Now what's it gonna be doc
Huh
[Hildi whimpering]  What's it gonna be
May I lift the hands off the tabletop in order to remove my billfold
That 12
[screaming]  To the man with the exceptional beard  and his unexceptional nigger
Mr. Moguy
Yes Calvin
Will you make these gentlemen a receipt for $12000 please
$12000
It was a pleasure doing business with y'all
Now gentlemen...  ...if you care to join me in the parlor...  ...we will be serving white cake
Excuse me
Could you please stop playing Beethoven
Take your hands off the harp
Doctor you can't go in there
Stephen Stephen
He ain't got no business going in there
Let it be
He's just a little upset that's all
White cake
I don't go in for sweets thank you
Hm
Actually I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today
D'Artagnan
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this
Come again
Alexandre Dumas
Yes of course doctor
I figured you must be an admirer
You named your slave after his novel's lead character
Now if Alexandre Dumas had been there today  I wonder what he would have made of it
Yes
His approval would be a dubious proposition at best
Softhearted Frenchie
Alexandre Dumas is black
Are these Broomhilda's papers
May I
Thank you
That is her bill of sale her ownership history  and of course her freedom papers doctor
Would you have ink and pen for me
Thank you
Thank you
Broomhilda Von Shaft...  ...consider yourself a free woman
Mr. Candie...  ...normally I would say auf Wiedersehen
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually means is "till I see you again"  and since I never wish to see you again  to you sir..
Let's go
Come on
One more moment doctor
What
It's a custom here in the South...  ...once a business deal is concluded that the two parties shake hands
I'm not from the South
But you are...  ...in my house doctor
So I'm afraid I must insist
On what
That I shake your hand
Oh then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction
What you think I am
No I don't
I think you are a bad loser
And I think you're an abysmal winner
Nevertheless here in Chickasaw County a deal ain't done  until the two parties have shook hands
Even after all that paper signin' don't mean shit...  ...you don't shake my hand
If I don't shake your hand you're gonna throw away $12000
Mr. Pooch
If she tries to leave here before this niggerloving German shakes my hand  you cut her ass down
You really want me to shake your hand
I insist
If you insist
Calvin
Calvin
I'm sorry
I couldn't resist
Help
[gunshot]  [Screaming]  Ah
[screams]    Holy...
Shit
Son of a bitch
[screaming continues]   What...
Fucking...  Goddamn it
What the fuck is going on
[screams]  You shot me
[man] Sorry Jessie
Who the fuck gave a nigger a goddamn gun
Nigger
Gonna kill...
Motherfucker
Shit
Shit
Stop shootin' goddamn it
Django
We got your woman
Billy Crash here got his pistol upside her head
[gasping]  You don't stop all that carrying on   he gonna blow her goddamn brains out
[gasping]  And that ain't no threat horse boy
That there is a promise
Horseshit
Honest lnjun Django
I swear 'fore God
You give up ain't no harm gonna come to her
Personally I don't give a good goddamn what you believe or don't believe
I believe if you don't give up in the next ten seconds  we gonna blow this bitch's brains out
Don't do it
[sniffling] You give me up
[Stephen] Six
Just let me go
Seven
[Hildi] Django
[Stephen] Eight

Cockadoodledo nigger
So y'all bounty hunters huh
We found your wanted posters...  ...and book of figures in your saddlebags
I got to say..
...I ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before
Black boy paid to kill white men
How'd you like that line of work
Time to say good night to them nuts blackie
[yelling]  On three
One...   [screaming]  I got you
Two...   [screaming]  Calm down now here it comes
[screaming] " [Stephen] Captain
Miss Lara want to see you
Something to do with the Old Man's funeral
She gonna give him to the LeQuint Dickey people
Well she didn't waste a minute telling me
How disappointing
This here what you take with you
Now mind you most of them ideas had to do with fuckin' with your fun parts
Now that may seem like a good idea but truth is...  ...when you snip a nigger's nuts  most of them bleed out in oh about hm... seven minutes
Most of 'em
Well more than most
Then I says: "Shitfire
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that.
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos.
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs.
And I said "What's so special about that
We do that shit all the time
Hell's bells the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that.
And as a slave of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company  henceforth till the day you die  all day every day  you will be swinging a sledgehammer  turning big rocks into little rocks
Now when you get there they gonna take away your name  give you a number and a sledgehammer  and say "Get to work!
One word of sass they cuts out your tongue
You won't bleed out
Oh they does that real good
They gonna work ya
All day every day till your back give out
And that will be the story of you Django
the golden rule Frankie eh
You don't root abos
I said hey white boy
Shut up black
You ain't got nothing to say I want to hear
How'd you like to make $11000
Do what now
11500 actually
What the fuck are you talking about
Back there at that plantation Candyland there was an $11500 fortune  just sittin' there
And y'all rode right past it
I ain't saying that
Nice thing about this fortune is it ain't illegal
You can't steal it
You got to earn it white boy
You got something to say mate you say it
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this murderous gang of stagecoach robbers  the Bacall Gang
There's a $7000 "Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him  $1500 for each of his three accomplices:  Dandy Michaels Gerald Nash  and Crazy Craig Koons
Now all four of them gentlemen  they back there at Candyland laughing their ass off
You know why
But it ain't got to be that way
What'd these jokers do again
These sons of bitches they killed innocent people
Stagecoach robbery
Innocent white people
I got the handbill right here in my pocket if you let me get it
Get it out
[man 2] But you're a slave
[man 1] "For murder..."   [Django] I ain't no goddamn slave
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave
[man 1] "$7000 for Smitty Bacall.
Hm
[man 2] That's a shitload
I'm a bounty hunter
Yesterday as a free man  I rode into Candyland on a horse with my German white partner  Dr. King Schultz
We finally found their ass layin' low in Candyland
We went in there to get 'em things went sour  my partner got killed Calvin Candie got shot  then everybody there decided to blame me so here I am
And all y'all know I ain't supposed to be on this trip
But them four men is still back there they're still wanted  and that 11500 is up for grabs and the last thing they'd expect  is y'all ridin' back in there and gettin' it
You tell us who they are and we turn you loose
Nononono
I ain't gonna tell you who they are
But you give me a pistol one of them horses  and $500 of that 11500 and I'll point 'em out to you
Now just 'cause it's a real handbill  doesn't mean that other bunch of malarkey is
Now why would a slave have a "Wanted Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket
Did that black ride into Candyland yesterday
All right I'm gonna ask you again
I want you to remember I don't like liars
Yeah
They walked us from the Greenville auction  and he rode in on a horse with a white man
Now this white man was the black his slave
He weren't no slave
What happened over in Candyland
Buncha shootin'
Massa got shot
Who shot him
The German
Why'd he do that
Nigger and the German was actin' like they were slavers but they wasn't
Bounty hunters
Fuck me Roy
I mean this could be big mate
I got one more condition
What's that
When we get there when time come...   ...you let me help you kill 'em
Hey... [laughs]  ...you're a funny bugger
Cut him loose

You got yourself a deal mate
Hey
Oh yeah
There we go

Oh no
I heard genuine care in your voice

You'd be surprised what happens if people just listen...  without succumbing to all that pain and anger
You heard shit monkey boy

Not an oven
Was she an old hag with a mole on her f ace with hair growing out of it
No no she was very beautiful
Ted
What's the problem
Well admittedly that was the best part of the evening
lt was pretty bloody good actually
Sounds like a pretty great way to start off the night to me
Why don't we just skip over the witches
Skipping the witches

Later in another room  some crazy fucking maniac sticks a gun in my f ace...  and f orces me to play out some psychosexual drama with his wif e.  He made you have psycho sex with his wif e
No he didn't make me fuck his wif e. He thought I fucked his wif e.   He held me at gunpoint with a loaded gun

Was it like Dirty Harry's gun
Did it have a real long barrel or a short barrel
What diff erence does it make
44 Magnum and a Magnum

The Mon Signor used to be a haven for movie stars
Through the Thirties Forties and first half of the Fifties  more movie stars if you break it down on a nightbynight basis  stayed at the Mon Signor than any other hotel in Hollywood
And a movie star clientele is important to that comeback
Now you look here  He probably just wants some champagne

"Bitch"
Bitch
Uh excuse me aren't you the one who's being paid to suck his cock cork boy
Whoa
Cork boy man
Business card
I see a new business card
Allow me to present our intentions to Theodore
I second the nomination
I move that nomination be closed
The court is yours Leo
Thank you very much Chester
Ted you ever seen any of them old Alfred Hitchcock episodes
Yes sir
Uh  Ah if you saw it you'd remember it
lt's called The Man From Rio with Peter Lorre Steve McQueen
Anyway Peter Lorre makes a bet with Steve McQueen...  that Steve McQueen can't light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row
Now if Steve McQueen lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a row  he wins Peter Lorre's new car
Norman and Chester here just made that same bet
Norman has bet his pinky...  that he can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row
lf he does  he wins Chester's 1964 Chevy Chevelle...  red fuckin' beautiful car
lf he doesn't chop off his fuckin' pinky
What do you say
Yes
Of course
Of course we're drunk
Teddy that's why we're here but that does not mean...  that we don't know what the fuck we're talking about
I'm gonna tell you what the fuck I'm talkin' about
I drive a motherfucking Honda that my sister sold me
You hear what I'm saying
A little white motherfuckin' Honda Civic
"Hollywood's hottest new star  That's me
next to America's hottest old car
That's the car I own
Are you listenin' to me
Goddamn shit
Are you listening to me
That's a 1964 niggerred ragtop Chevy Chevelle
And I love that car more than l love hips lips or fingertips
Cut to: We're sittin' here celebratin' gettin' high   drinking champagne  Drinking Cristal
When you're drinking champagne you're drinking champagne
When you're drinking Cristal you say you're drinking Cristal
Whatever that pissityass thing is we are drinking it you know
[Murmurs]  What what
Hey hey hey
When all of a sudden  we flip on Steve McQueen Peter Lorre being fuckin' badasses
Badasses
And I look over at this funnylooking motherfucker over here  and I say "I'd do that f or the Chevelle.
I'm funny
And that's when Chester says  "Oh really?
We already told you we were drunk Ted
That goes without motherfucking saying
'Cause if we wasn't drunk we'd probably chicken out
When you're fucked up you don't lie
Man you tell the fuckin' truth
Which brings us to your part in this little wager Ted
I don't have a part sir
That's it
Like my old granddaddy used to always say  "The less a man makes declarative statements  the less apt he is to look f oolish in retrospect
Ah thank you thank you thank you
Thing is there are some inherent obstacles in this undertaking
Aside from the obvious
First of which is being the f act that I'm not like Peter Lorre on that TV show
I'm not some sick fuck travelin' the countryside collecting fingers
All right you know we're all buddies here
No one wants Norman to lose his finger
We just want to chop it off
Well hopefully sir
Yeah well they sewed that guy's dick back on
They can sew Norman's pinky back on
Yeah how hard can it be
So Norman he's he's taken care of you know
My interests on the other hand have not
I am as emotionally attached to my car as Norman is physically to his finger
That's a very fuckin' piece of expensive machinery I'm putting on this wager
And you know if I lose I lose
That's fine
I have no problem with that
I'm a big boy
I knew exactly what the hell I was doing
But if I win l wanna win
lf Norman lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a fuckin' row  he's gonna have no emotional problems whatsoever about taking my car keys
[Murmurs]  But if I win  well it's not inconceivable that at the last minute...  maybe neither Leo or l...  will be able to... wield the axe
A hatchet sir
Which brings us full circle to you Ted
[Glass Clatters On Bar]  Cleareyed Ted
Sober Ted
Completestranger Ted
Justmetusandcouldn't giveafuckaboutus Ted
We want you to be the dice man
Hell of a night huh Ted
I've got to get out of here
Money
Ted I got a $100 bill here with your name on it  whether you do what we ask or not
Just to sit back down in that chair for one minute more
But that has nothin' to do with this $100 bill in my hand
ln f act you can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that goddamn door
But if you wait 60 seconds bef ore you do it  you're gonna be $100 richer
Ted you're gonna do whatever you wanna do
All we're askin' is that you indulge us for one minute more
My friend Chester here is willing to pay you for that minute
Ted take the money
I sit on that stool listen to what you have to say for 60 seconds   and I get $100
[Chester] Correct
And afterwards I can walk out that door no hard f eelings
You got a deal
Yes
Oh yes yes
Yes yes yes
Ted good answer
All right
Norman give me your watch
Let me know when a minute ends and when it begins
You got it
Ah
Okay
Gentlemen start your engines
Okay Ted pay attention here
I'm gonna make two piles here on the bar
One pile which is yours
And another pile which could be yours
And what you have to realize is we're gonna do this thing...  one way or the other
You can buy a whole lot of soup with that pile
I'm the closer here
All right
I'm a little me Um I've lost count
How much is on the bar here
Okay
Ted do you know how long it takes the average American to count to 600
[Angela] lt's a rhetorical question Ted
No sir
Now Ted a person's lif e is filled with a zillion little experiences
Some which are insignificant have no meaning and you know you f orget them
Others which you remember f or the rest of your natural lif e.  Now since what we're proposing here is so unusual  so outside the norm  that this is a good bet that this is going to be one of those incidents that sticks
So since you're gonna be stuck remembering this f or the rest of your lif e  you have to decide what that memory will be
So Ted are you going to remember for the next 40 years  give or take a decade  that you refused $1000 f or one second's worth of work
Or that you made $1000 f or one second's worth of work
Time
Okay
[Group] Yes
Always be closing
Right here right now
Bef ore I change my mind
Hear hear
Let's go
Get this shit over and done with
Ahh
Perf ect perf ect perf ect
This is one of those moments in time...  none of us are ever gonna f orget
I'm ready
Ted are you ready
Okeydokey
Norman...  begin
Aaah
My fuckin' finger
Chester my fuckin' finger man
He cut off my fuckin' finger
lt hurts
Nonsense Syllables]  My fuckin' finger Chester
He cut off my fuckin' finger
Aaah
Oh Leo
Wrap it up
Wrap it up
Could I talk to Don Levine please
do this
he's in surgery
He was expecting my call
He was supposed to be there
What
Who the fuck has plastic surgery at 6:30 in the morning on New Year's Eve
Leo
I need you to stand still
Hold it
Oh fuck
Oh fuck
All right
Oh
Leo
l gotta get the  lt's the finger
I got the finger
l got it
I got it
right here
You're on it
The fuckin' door's closin'
Here
All right let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Come on
Get up get up
I'm gonna go back to my room
Are you comin' or not
I'll see ya
[Group] Oh
Close the fuckin' door
Are you aware of my existence
Yes
This is good
Now are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France
Yes
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself
But the meaning of your visit  pleasant though it is is mysterious to me
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews  and found nothing
I'm aware of that
I've read the reports of this area
But like any enterprise when under new management  there is always a slight duplication of efforts  most of it being a complete waste of time but needs to be done nevertheless
I just have a few questions monsieur LaPadite
Now  before the occupation there were four Jewish families in this area  all dairy farmers like yourself
Doleracs Rollins the Loveitts  and the Dreyfuses
Is that correct
To my knowledge  those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers
this is your house make yourself comfortable
Now according to these papers  all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for  except the Dreyfuses
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape  or someone is very successfully hiding them
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses monsieur LaPadite
I love rumors
Facts could be so misleading  where rumors true or false are often revealing
Again this is just a rumor  but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain
So the rumors you've heard have been of escape
Yes
Having never met the Dreyfuses would you confirm for me  the exact members of the household and their names
The father Jacob
Wife Miram
And her brother Bob
How old is Bob
Thirty 31
And the children  Amos  and Shosanna
Ages of the children
Amos was nine or 10
And Shosanna
And Shosanna was  18 or 19
Well I guess that should do it
However before I go could I have another glass of your delicious milk
But of course
I have no interest in such things
But you are aware of what they call me
I'm aware
That they call you "The Jew Hunter.
Precisely
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker  the good people of Prague have bestowed on him
Actually why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me
lt would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it
Now I on the other hand love my unofficial title  precisely because I've earned it
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is  as opposed to most German soldiers  I can think like a Jew  where they can only think like a German
Now if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast  it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast  it would be that of the rat
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing
But where our conclusions differ  is I don't consider the comparison an insult
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in
It's a hostile world indeed
I suppose I would
Has a rat ever done anything to you  to create this animosity you feel toward them
Rats spread disease
They bite people
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread  a squirrel could equally carry
Would you agree
No
Yet they're both rodents are they not
And except for the tail they even rather look alike don't they
It's an interesting thought Herr Colonel
However interesting as the thought may be  it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel
Probably not
I didn't think so
You don't like them
You don't really know why you don't like them
All you know is you find them repulsive
Where does the hawk look
He looks in the barn he looks in the attic he looks in the cellar  he looks everywhere he would hide
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide
However the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria  and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me
May I smoke my pipe as well
Please Herr Colonel make yourself at home
Now my job dictates  that I must have my men enter your home  and conduct a thorough search  before I can officially cross your family's name off my list
And if there are any irregularities to be found rest assured they will be
I might add also that any information  that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment
Actually quite the contrary
It will be met with reward
And that reward will be  your family will cease to be harassed in any way  by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country
Yes
Yes
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding
Since I haven't heard any disturbance  I assume while they're listening they don't speak English
Yes
ls that clear
Yes
It's the girl
Au revoir Shosanna
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine
And I'm putting together a special team and I need me eight soldiers
Eight Jewish American soldiers
Now you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon
Well we'll be leaving a little earlier
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians
Once we're in enemy territory  as a bushwhacking guerrilla army  we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only
Killing Nazis
Nazi ain't got no humanity
They're the foot soldiers of a Jewhating massmurdering maniac  and they need to be destroyed
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform  they're going to die
That means I got a little lndian in me
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance
We will be cruel to the Germans
And through our cruelty they will know who we are
And the German won't be able to help themselves  but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands  and our boot heels and the edge of our knives
And the German will be sickened by us
And the German will talk about us
And the German will fear us
And when the German closes their eyes at night  and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done  it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with
ALL: Yes sir
That's what I like to hear
When you join my command you take on debit
A debit you owe me personally
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps
And I want my scalps
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis
Hey Hirschberg
Send that Kraut sarge over
HIRSCHBERG: You
Sergeant Werner Rachtman
Lieutenant Aldo Raine
Pleased to meet you
Yes
Then sit down
How is your English Werner
Wicki here  an AustrianJew got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good
Became American got drafted come back to give y'all what for
Another one up there you might be familiar with
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz
Heard of him
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz
MALE NARRATOR: The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity  among German soldiers is simple
Instead of putting him up against a wall  the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin  to be made an example of
Needless to say once the Basterds heard about him  he never got there
Lieutenant Aldo Raine
These are the Basterds
Ever heard of us
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work
When it comes to killing Nazis...   ..
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur
Can I assume you know who we are
You're Aldo the Apache
Werner if you heard of us  you probably heard we ain't in the prisonertaking business
We in the killing Nazi business and cousin business is abooming
Now that leaves two ways we can play this out
Either kill you or let you go
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive  depends entirely on you
Up the road a piece there's an orchard
Besides you we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere
If that patrol were to have any crack shots  that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again  you got to show me on this here map where they are
You got to tell me how many they are and you got to tell me  what kind of artillery they're carrying with them
Well now Werner that's where you're wrong because that's exactly what I expect
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees
And you need to tell me
Now just take that finger of yours  and point out on this here map where this party is being held  how many is coming and what they brought to play with
I respectfully refuse sir
Hear that
Yes
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz
The Bear Jew
Now if you heard of Aldo the Apache you got to have heard about The Bear Jew
I heard of The Bear Jew
Beats German soldiers with a club
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat what he does
He's going to take that big bat of his  and he's going to beat your ass to death with it
Now take your Wienerschnitzellicking finger  and point out on this map what I want to know
Fuck you
And your Jew dogs
Actually Werner we're all tickled to hear you say that
Quite frankly watching Donny beat Nazis to death  is the closest we ever get to going to the movies
DONNY: Yeah
Oblige him
Did you get that for killing Jews
Bravery
Yeah
BASTERD 1: Oh no
BASTERD 2: Oh no
BASTERD: Yeah Donny
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park
He went yard on that one on to fucking Lansdowne Street
You
Damn it Hirschberg
Donny bring that other one over here
Alive
Batter up
You're on deck
Two hits
I hit you you hit the ground
English
Ask him if he wants to live
Tell him to point out on this map the German position
Ask him how many Germans
Around about 12
Now when you report what happened here  you can't tell them you told us what you told us
They'll shoot you
They're going to want to know why you so special we let you live
Now that you've survived the war when you get home what you going to do
WlCKl: He's going to hug his mother
Well ain't that nice
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform
Yeah that's what we thought
We don't like that
See we like our Nazis in uniforms
Just like that
But you take off that uniform ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi
And that don't sit well with us
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall don't you
Practice
HANS: Au revoir Shosanna
Hey you can't bring those here on a public vehicle
They're films ain't they
Yes
Then they're flammable
MALE NARRATOR: Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper
Shosanna has a collection  of over 350 nitrate film prints
MAN: Right this way Lieutenant
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting sir
General Ed Fenech
At ease Hicox
If you offer me a scotch and plain water I could drink a scotch and plain water
Thataboy Lieutenant
Make it yourself like a good chap will you
The bar is in the globe
Whiskey
Straight
No junk in it
lt says here that you speak German fluently
And your occupation before the war
I'm a film critic
List your accomplishments
Well sir such as they are  I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers  and I've had two books published
Don't be modest Lieutenant
What are their titles
The first book was called  Art of the Eyes the Heart and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema in the '20s
And the second one was called TwentyFour Frame da Vinci
It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W
What should we drink to sir
All the way down sir
Yes
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich
Yes
Explain it to me
Pardon sir
Well this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry  under the Third Reich
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels
An alternative to what he considers  the JewishGerman intellectual cinema of the '20s  and the Jewishcontrolled dogma of Hollywood
How's he doing
Frightfully sorry sir
Once again
Well compared to say Louis B. Mayer  how's he doing
Quite well actually
Since Goebbels has taken over  film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick
Lieutenant Hicox at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino
Three days from now  Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris
What film sir
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion  will be Goebbels Goring Bormann and most of the German High Command  including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo  as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry
The master race at play
Basically we have all our rotten eggs in one basket
And like the snows of yesteryear gone from this earth
Jolly good sir
The Germans call them the Basterds
The Basterds
Never heard of them
Whole point of the Secret Service old boy you not hearing of them
But the Jerries have heard of them because these Yanks have been them the devil
The Basterds will be waiting for you
In Nadine there's a tavern called La Louisiane
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent
She'll take it from there
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere
It'll be you her and two Germanborn members of the Basterds
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark
Bridget von Hammersmark
Yes for the last two years now
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild
Indeed
Got the gist
I think so sir
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement
l didn't know
You said it was in a tavern
lt is a tavern
You know fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties
Number one being you're fighting in a basement
What if we go in there and she's not even there
Don't worry
She's a British spy
She'll make the rendezvous
Stiglitz right
l hear you're pretty good with that
You know we're not looking for trouble right now
Simply making contact with our agent
However the off chance I'm wrong things prove eventful  I need to know we can all remain calm
I don't look calm to you
Well now that you put it like that l guess you do
This Jerry of yours Stiglitz not exactly the loquacious type is he
ls that the kind of man you need
Fair point Lieutenant
So you all get in trouble in there what are we supposed to do
Make bets on how it all comes out
If we get into trouble we can handle it
But if trouble does happen we need you to make damn sure  no Germans or French for that matter escape from that basement
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous
She chose the spot
Isn't that just dandy
She's just an actress
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement
She wasn't picking a place to fight
Mmm
HlCOX SPEAKING GERMAN ]               Well if this is it old boy  l hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's
By all means Captain
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily  l must say damn good stuff sir
Now about this pickle  we find ourselves in
lt would appear there's only one thing left for you to do
Stiglitz
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls
You outside
Who are you
British
ALDO: We're American
What are you
I'm a German you idiot
ALDO: Speak English pretty good for a German
So let's talk
Okay talk
I'm a father
My baby was born today
ln Frankfurt
Five hours ago
H is name is Max
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing
It's not my fault
Okay
lt wasn't your fault
Wilhelm
Now is there anybody alive on our side
No
I'm alive
ALDO: Who's that
Which girl
Who do you think
Von Hammersmark
Yeah she's ours
Wilhelm
But she's alive
ALDO: Okay Wilhelm
What do you say we make us a deal
What's your name
Okay Wilhelm here's my deal
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away
No guns
No guns me no guns you
And we take the girl and leave
It's that simple Willi
You go your way we go ours
So what do you say Willi
Aldo
I'm here Willi
l want to trust you
But..
But how can l
What choice you got son
Aldo  I'm going to trust you
Come down
l thought we had us a deal
We still have a deal
Now get the girl and go
Not so fast
We only got a deal we trust each other
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff
You got guns on us
You decide to shoot we're dead
They drop them down here you're dead
That's a Mexican standoff and that was not the deal
No trust no deal
All right Aldo
Fine
Not so goddamn fast doc
Tell him to go play with his dogs
Before we yank that slug out you you need to answer a few questions
Few questions about what
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it
l can see since you didn't see what happened inside  that the Nazis being there must look odd
Yeah we got a word for that kind of odd in English
It's called suspicious
Everybody needs to calm down
You're letting your imagination get the better of you
You met the sergeant yourself
Willi
Yeah I remember him
His wife had a baby tonight
He had just become a..
He had just become a father
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence
It couldn't be both
How'd the shooting start
The Englishman gave himself away
He ordered three glasses
We order three glasses
That's the German three
Germans would and did notice it
Okay let's pretend there were no Germans  and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to
What was the next step
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms  with all the military there would've been suicide
But going as members of the German film industry  they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere
Hand me my purse
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort
You still get us in that premiere
You speak German better than your friends
No
Have I been shot
Yes
Least of all by tomorrow night
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino
One the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue
Enormous change at the last minute
That's not very Germatic
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar
Which is
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere
Fuck a duck
What are you thinking
What is that supposed to mean
lt means you getting us in that premiere
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg
Byebye acting career
Fun while it lasted
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet
He's going to wrap it up in a cast  and you got a good howlbrokemyleg mountainclimbing story
You all like climbing mountains don't you
I don't
I like smoking drinking and ordering in restaurants
But I see your point
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears  and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet
We both speak a little ltalian
With an atrocious accent no doubt
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib
So you mumble ltalian and brazen through it
Is that the plan
That's about it
That sounds good
What else are we going to do
Go home
No that sounds good
If you don't blow it with that I can get you in the building
Who does what
Well I speak the most ltalian so I'll be your escort
Omar third most
I don't speak ltalian
Like I said third best
Just keep your fucking mouth shut
In fact why don't you start practicing right now
Yes
Gorlomi
Gorlomi
Antonio Margheriti
HANS: Margheriti
ANNOUNCING IN GERMAN ]     What's that American expression
"If the shoe fits you must wear it.
ALDO: Fucking shithead
Faggot fuck
Fuck you
Bunch of shithead fuck
Goddamn Nazi farts sons of bitches
Get your hands off me
You fucking bratwurstsmelling... Goddamn you
Hmm
You Jerrybanging Limburgsmelling...   As Stanley said to Livingstone  Lieutenant Aldo Raine I presume
Hans Landa
You've had a nice long run Aldo
Alas you're now in the hands of the SS
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you
Caught you flinching
ALDO: Touch me again Krautburger
Utivich
Is that you Lieutenant
Omar
The woman
No I do not
Tell me Aldo if I were sitting where you're sitting  would you show me mercy
Nope
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot.
Yeah I was just thinking that
So you're Aldo the Apache
So you're The Jew Hunter
I'm a detective
A damn good detective
And yes some of them were Jews
But Jew Hunter
Just a name that stuck
Well you do have to admit it is catchy
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you
Germans' nickname for you
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man
And as if to make my point I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life
l mean you're a little fellow but not circusmidget little  as your reputation would suggest
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark
Well let's just say she got what she deserved
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark  you get what you pay for
Now as far as your paesanos Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...  How you know our names
Lieutenant Aldo  if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate  every single one of your swastikamarked survivors  we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed
No I guess not
Well back to the whereabouts of your two ltalian saboteurs
As of this moment  both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in
And your mission some would call a terrorist plot  as of this moment is still a go
That's a pretty exciting story
What's next
Eliza on lce
However  all I have to do is pick up this phone right here  inform the cinema and your plan is kaput
I have no doubt
And yes some Germans will die
Yes it will ruin the evening
And yes Goebbels will be very very very mad at you  for what you've done to his big night
And you need all four to end the war
But if I don't pick up this phone right here  you may very well get all four
And if you get all four you end the war  tonight
So gentlemen  let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight
So the way I see it  since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction  if I do nothing  it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves
I guess so
How about you Utivich
I guess so too
Gentlemen l have no intention  of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann  not to mention winning the war singlehandedly for the Allies  only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal
If you want to win the war tonight  we have to make a deal
What kind of deal
However I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer
A general
That's a bingo
Is that the way you say it
"That's a bingo.
Bingo
How fun
But I digress
Where were we
Yeah
Make a deal
Over there is a very capable twoway radio and sitting behind it  is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann
If that tastes better going down
Where is that exactly
Maynardville Tennessee
I've done my share of bootlegging
Long story short we hear a story too good to be true  it ain't
Sitting in your chair l would probably say the same thing  and 999
999 times out of a million you would be correct
But in the pages of history every once in a while  fate reaches out and extends its hand
MAN: I implore you
We must destroy that tower
Sarge that tower...  MAN: The tower stands
Psst
Psst
HANS: So when the military history of this night is written  it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino  from the very beginning as a double agent
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel  was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil  to establish my cover with the Germans
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite  in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor  for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich
Full citizenship for myself
Well that goes without saying
And I would like the United States of America  to purchase property for me on Nantucket lsland  as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved  by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party  to a swifterthanimagined end
Do you have all that sir
Lieutenant Raine
Right here
Yes sir
GENERAL: Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines
Upon crossing our lines Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you
Yes sir
Over and out
When I kill that guy you got 30 feet to get to that guard
Can you do it
Champagne
Who wants to send a message to Germany
I have a message for Germany
That you are all going to die
Marcel burn it down
Oui Shosanna
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus  and this is the face  of Jewish vengeance
HANS: Hermann uncuff them
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you Lieutenant Raine
We're your prisoners
How about my knife
Thank you very much Colonel
ls that really necessary
I'm a slave to appearances
Scalp Hermann
What have you done
I made a deal with your general for that man's life
Yeah they made that deal
But they don't give a fuck about him
You'll be shot for this
Nah I don't think so
More like chewed out
I've been chewed out before
You know Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass
I'd make that deal
How about you Utivich
You make that deal
I'd make that deal
Damn good deal
Well if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command  l suppose that's worth certain considerations
But I do have one question
When you get to your little place on Nantucket lsland  l imagine you are going to take off that handsomelooking SS uniform of yours
Ain't you
That's what I thought
Now that I can't abide
Not one damn bit sir
l mean if I had my way  you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your peckersucking life
But I'm aware that ain't practical
I mean at some point you're going to have to take it off
So  I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off
I think this just might be my masterpiece

You might argue with them about price and shit  but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back
But I got me a rule
That's why I need you
Backup

I'm gonna tell 'em I'm goin' in the trunk to show 'em the goods
When I open the trunk you pop up and rack this motherfucker
Man fuck that shit
I ain't said nothin' about you shootin' nobody
All you gotta do is hold on to it
They'll get the idea
You must be out of your mind if you think I'm gonna get in this dirtyass trunk
We ain't goin' nowhere but to Korea town man
Why can't I ride up front with you?
You can't ride up front with me
The surprise element is 90% of it
I'm sorry man but I ain't gettin' in no goddamn trunk
I can't believe you'd do me like this
Do you like what man?
I just ain't climbing in no goddamn dirtyass trunk man
I got a problem with small places
How small was that jail cell motherfucker?
I know I owe you you got to bring all this up
Then get your ass in this trunk
I want to help you but I won't be locked in no goddamn trunk of no car
I know you helped me out
Do you think I wanted to spend $10000 on your ass?
Of course you didn't but look in the trunk?
That's the only way I could help you right?
So that's what I did

Yeah
Come on in
Ah no man
I got some foryoureyesonly shit to show you
Why don't you step outside?
Who was that?
That's Beaumont
Who's Beaumont?
What'd he do?
He put hisself in a position where he was gonna have to do ten years in prison
That's what he did
And if you know Beaumont  you know there ain't no goddamn way he can do ten years
Now Louis  if you gonna come in on this thing with me  you've got to be prepared...  to go all the way
Now I got me so far a half million dollars in lock boxes...  in a bank down in Cabo San Lucas
I make this delivery  I'm gonna have me over a million
Hey you think I'm gonna let a little cheeseeatin' nigger like this fuck that up?
Before I let that happen I'll shoot this nigger in the head...  and ten niggers look just like him
You understand what I'm saying?
Yeah
Sowe on the same page then?
Yeah I follow
My nigger
Hi I'm Detective Mark Dargas L.A.P.D
Can I ask what you have in that bag?
The usual stuff
Can I help out here?
Who's this?
Sorry this is Special Agent Ray Nicollet with Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms
May I see some I.D.?
Yeah
Sure
Would you mind if we just took a look in that bag?
Do I mind?
Yeah
You have the right to say no
No
I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant
If I don't want to go to all that trouble I'd just take you in on suspicion now
Uh could I say something?
He just wants to peek inside the bag for a minute
I'll keep my eye on him so he doesn't take anything
Thanks a lot
Bad knees
You have a good flight?
It's a shitty flight down to Cabo
I went down there one time with Susan my wife
Fuckin' turbulence was unbelievable
Ah
Goddamn
I'd say there's about oh uh  $50000 here
What would you say Ray
Looks like about 50000 from here
What if I say no?
You should know if you bring in anything over 1 0000 you have to declare it
You can get a $250000 fine plus two years in prison
You want to talk to us about this or do you want to talk to Customs?
I'm not sayin' another word
Jackie  I hope you don't mind if I call you Jackie
Those guys down in Customs?
They're a bunch of pricks
There's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with
You can go down and talk with those guys...  who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings  or you can talk with a couple of goodhearted guys like Mark and myself
It's up to you
at the file on Jacqueline Brown
In 1985 while a stewardess for Delta  you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot
That pilot was my husband and I got off
You mean they offered you a deal and you grabbed it
He did time you did probation
May I smoke?
No you may not
So you get off with a slap on the wrist  but all this criminal activity fucks up your shit for good with the big airlines
I make 1 6 000 plus benefits
You been in the service industry 19 years and all you make is 16000 plus benefits
Didn't exactly set the world on fire did you Jackie?
a good one is more like it
Otherwise you'll be in Sybil Brand three weeks...  before the public defender gets around to ya
Hey Jackie do you know a guy named Beaumont Livingston?
Yeah?
No?
Well he knew you
He's dead
They found him in a trunk of a car this morning  shot twice
Once in the chest once in the head
Here you go
So I guess I'm wondering
If you don't know Beaumont  why do you suppose Beaumont knows you?
You know who we want
If you cooperate tell us what we want to know we'll help you get out of this
If you refuse to cooperate continue to cop a shit attitude like you're doing now  we will give you to Customs and they will take you to court
With your prior the judge will give you two years
Now you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change  but if I was a 44yearold black woman...  desperately clinging on to this one shitty little job I was fortunate enough to get  I don't think that I'd think I had a year to throw away
So let's start again now shall we
I 'm not sayin' another goddamn word
I 'd like your permission to look through this again so we'll know how much we're talking about
Sure
While we're at it let's see what else is in there
Do you mind
Beauty case
Mmhmm
What's in it
Glass case
Birth control
What's that
My diet shit
Let's see what else is in there

How does your client plead?
Uh Your Honor she wishes to stand mute
Very well
Detective... Varga
Sorry
Uh you were the arresting officer in this case?
That's correct Your Honor
Yes I do Your Honor
And that would be?
Based on the defendant's prior conviction...  and the extreme possibility of flight due to the occupation  the state requests a bond of no less than 25000
I'm gonna set bond at 1 0000...  and set the date of August 2 1...  for the prelim
Your Honor when will that be?
That's six weeks from now
We'll continue this matter then
Owens case 72242
How does your client plead
I thought it'd be 2 5.  would like to plead guilty Your Honor
here in the courtroom
Uhuhuh
Comfortable?
Door was open so I just come on in
I can see that
Why?
Got some more business for you
What did he do?
She is an airline stewardess
Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow
They set her bond this afternoon at $1 0000
Now I'm figuring you could take that $1 0000 you owe me from Beaumont  move it over to the stewardess
The bond for possession's only a thousand
Hmm
Man they fuckin' with her
They callin' that shit "possession with intent.
A 44yearold black woman caught with less than two ounces  they calling that shit "intent.
The same thing happen to a movie star they call it "possession.
Still sounds high
You know I think somebody already did
What?
You ain't hear?
Hear what?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out
That shit rhymes
Blew Beaumont's brains out
Police make contact with you?
Oh hell yeah
You know they see I pay a big money bond for my boy  they start thinking that "where there's smoke there's fire" logic
Rousted my ass out of bed 1 0:.00 in the morning
Scared the shit out of my woman Sheronda
She thought they was gonna take my ass away for sure
Mmhmm
Brown
Jackie Brown
What does she do for you?
She's my friend
My friends get in trouble I like to help them out
Beaumont worked for you
You can't tell nothing I say to you?
You're not my client till you get busted and I bond you out
Well we ain't got no uh What you call that shit?
Confidentiality
Why should I tell you anything?
You got stewardesses bringing you 50 grand
And why would a stewardess be bringing me 50 grand?
Now you want me to speculate on what you do
I'd say you were in the drug business except the money's moving in the wrong direction
Whatever you're into you seem to be getting away with it so uh more power to you
All right
You want to move the 1 0000 you got on Beaumont over to the stewardess
That means paperwork
I gotta get a death certificate present it to the court  make out a receipt for return of bond collateral I type up another application   Hey hey hey hey
another indemnity agreement
I haven't got time
What you have to do in case you forgot   is come up with a premium of a thousand bucks
I can do that
You know I got the money
Come back when you do
I'll bond out the stewardess
Look you got to look at this with a little compassion all right?
She ain't used to this kind of treatment
Gangsters don't give a fuck but your average citizen  a couple of nights in County get to fuckin' with their mind
Ordell this isn't a bar
You don't have a tab
You got a 44yearold gainfully employed black woman falsely accused  Falsely accused?
She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Falsely accused of "intent.
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
Oh it's like that huh?
All right
I got your little thousand bucks

Take it off and put it back on
Mm
If I can't fly I'm gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my rent
You know  the other day I figured out that I must have written about...  1 5000 bonds since I've been in the business
So far they told me if I cooperate  then I'll get probation maybe
Or if I stand mute I can get as much as five years
Does that sound right?
That's state time prison
But they won't want to do that
They'll offer you simple possession a couple of months of county time...  and a year or two of probation
Do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?
Yeah
But that's not what this is about
They were waiting for my ass
They even knew the exact amount
What did they want to know?
Who gave me the money and who I was givin' it to
They found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off
They said it was him who told them about me
How do you know about him?
I wrote him on Monday
Ordell pick up his bond?

Thanks a lot
It wasn't mine
What?
Oh shit
I bet that was that present Mr. Walker was sending Melanie
Yeah
If you didn't put it in there he must have
Damn
That shit wasn't called for
Bet they asked you a whole shit load of questions about it huh?
Probably asked you who you was bringing' it to too
They asked
And you said?
"I want to talk to my lawyer.
You sure you didn't get nervous and kind of let somethin' slip?
I mean if you did I ain't mad at you
I just gotta know
They were waiting for me
They knew about the money and they knew the exact amount
They tell you how they happen to come by this information
Hmm
I knew it
I knew it
They even asked me if I knew Mr. Walker
Yeah?
I didn't tell them anything about him
Mmmm
You ain't said nothin' about me
Mmmm
Ah that's mighty noble of you
Yeah they told me
Yeah
Somebody must have been real mad at old Beaumont
Or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time
Yeah I bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions
And you ain't givin' them no kind of answer
You scared of me
You got any reason to be nervous around me
Is that what I think it is?
I think it's a gun pressed up against my dick
Well you thought right
Now take your hands from around my throat  nigger
What the hell's wrong with you Jackie?
Shut the fuck up
Don't you move
What the fuck is this
I carry that all the time
You been talking to them police too much
The police didn't try and strangle my ass
Come on girl
I ain't playing with you
I'm gonna unload both of these motherfuckers if you don't do what I tell you to do
You understand what I'm saying
Do you understand what the fuck I'm saying
Yeah woman
Damn
Now sit your ass down on that sofa
See
Police start fuckin' with your mind start pittin' black against black
That's how they do
They been doing this since  Shut your raggedy ass up
And put your hands behind your head
This is gettin' silly now
You want to see some motherfuckin' silly
If I have to tell you to shut up one more time I'm gonna shut you up
I just came over here to talk to you
To talk?
The way I see it you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about
One thing  and that's what you are wiling to do for me
Now sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal  and you know that
That's why you came here to kill me
I ain't come over to kill you
No that's all right
It's okay
Now I forgive you
Now let's say if I tell on you  I walk

You know I got that problem
All my money is  In Mexico
Right
Well I been thinking about that too
Uh  Let me hear that
We friends again
Why don't you point that motherfucking gun somewhere else
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on
All right
You want your gun back
Max look I am so sorry about this
I mean you'd have to
Would you like some coffee
If you're having some
I am
Come on in
Why don't you make yourself at home
Did you get a chance to use it?
I felt a lot safer having it
Oh the milk went bad while I was in jail
Cool
Would you uh care to hang on to it for a while
I got one now
You went out this morning and bought a gun
What
I didn't hear you
Well let's say I got one now okay
Somebody loan it to you
Yeah
All right
It might be a little black
Would you like to hear some music
Sure
Cool
You know I couldn't wait to get home last night...  and wash the jail outta my hair
It looks nice
Thanks

I'm gonna go in and talk with Nicolet and Dargas today
I'm going to do what you suggested offer to help and see what happens
What I meant was to have a lawyer do the negotiating for you
No I want to talk to them first
I know more now about Ordell's money
Well if it's the A.T.F
I know but it's a lot of money
It's a half a million dollars all in Cabo and more coming in
Ordell told me last night
He called?
He came by
We talked
Do you think he still trusts you?
He had his doubts at first but he's always trusted me
And he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can
Why
Because he needs my ass
You want some sugar
No thank you
Maybe but I'm the only one he's ever used
I mean he can't use his other people
They're crooks
I mean he might try to... bring the money in himself  but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines
So either he recruits another Cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me
And I made him feel like he still can
Are you gonna offer to set him up
Otherwise fuck 'em
Do you realize that
Well I ain't going back to jail and I ain't doing that probation thing again
Max how do you feel about getting old
You look great
how do you feel about getting old
Doesn't it bother you
It's not really something I think about
I guess I got sensitive about my hair a few years ago
It started falling out so I did something about it
How'd you feel about that
I feel fine with it
Otherwise I wouldn't have done it
I did it to feel better about myself and you know I do
I look in the mirror
Yeah but it's different for men
You know I can't really feel too sorry for you in this department
I bet that except for possibly an afro  you look exactly the way you did at 29
Well my ass ain't the same

Okay
When was the last time I saw you
Oh... six seven years ago
It doesn't seem like that long ago
It was that long ago
How old were you in this picture
The roller disco picture
This one
Oh
Um 14
You were 14 here
Shit man
Well I'm about the same height now as I was then
Bruno
Sanchez
Yeah?
That was taken at that place called Flippers
Do you remember that
It was in Hollywood
Were you in L.A. then
No
Where were you
With Ordell
Yeah
We had done some time already
Oh
Nah
Come on
Don't lie
No I wasn't
Were you ever in one
I went to a few just to meet women but...  it was so loud and I didn't like to dance
During that whole scene I just drank in bars usually
So who didn't make the cut
That's a picture of me in Japan
Uh that's the guy that I lived with
His name was HiHiro Hiro Hiroshi
He must have made quite an impression
If you count cheese
You know I couldn't speak any Japanese and his English was terrible
But what am I going to say
His English was better than my Japanese you know
Not really
You know we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway
I never really got to know him but I knew enough to know...  that I wasn't missing much so  Anyway I keep that picture because of all the fucking time I was there  that's the only picture I've got of me in Japan
That's Japan
Oh
Well Yeah I can Yeah it looks I could tell
Wanna fuck
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah that really hit the spot

Hey
Damn
I'm gonna have to remember this place
About two minutes from your crib ten minutes from the gig
Not bad
What's your drink brother
Let me get a screwdriver homie
Oh I'm fine
Yes you are
Damn
I bet you come in here on a Saturday night  you need nigger repellant to keep them motherfuckers off your ass
Oh I do okay
Bullshit Jackie
I bet you do a damn sight better than okay
You think anybody followed you
I don't think so
But it don't matter 'cause they already know I'm meeting you
How the fuck they know that?
You told  3.25
Keep it
Thank you sir
You told 'em it's me
They already know it's you
Goddamn that don't mean you got to confirm it
Look the only way they're going to give me permission to fly...  is if I agree to help 'em which is what I have to appear to be doing
You tell 'em anything else
Yeah you got a half a mill in Mexico and you want me to bring it in
Goddamn You told them all that
What the fuck that got to do with anything
They know I'm delivering for you
I told 'em about the half mil
They could give a fuck about it
All they wanna do is catch your ass with guns
So I said "Look you want proof he's getting paid for selling 'em
And they said
Yes
Hey what's the matter
This is just seeming kind of risky now you know
Now let me lay it all out to you okay
I make two deliveries the first with 10000
You know like a dry run
They watch it see how it works
Then the second delivery I come home with the half mil
See that's too much exposure
Now I ain't goin' nowhere near that money
You don't have to
I told them you never pick up the money yourself
You always send someone and I never know who it is
Mm
That's a good idea
Now the first time I do it they're looking around  they see me hand the 10000 to someone
I don't know
A friend of yours
Like a woman
If you want
Yeah
Yeah I'm thinking a woman
Wait a minute
'Cause I don't trust 'em
Now the next trip when I bring in the half mils  it's gonna look like I'm doing the same thing as I did before
No
I hand it to someone else first
Hmm
And they follow the wrong one  thinking she's bringing the money to me
That's the idea
Can you cover that?
Yeah
Yeah I got the women covered
The Dell Amo Mal the food court
And I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
We're in this together
Yeah but it's my money and I don't need no fuckin' partners
I ain't your partner
I'm your manager
So therefore I'm your manager and a manager gets 1 5%
No a manager gets ten percent
No that's an agent
I'm gonna give you ten
No
No
A manager gets 1 5% agent gets 1 0
I'm getting 1 5% all right?
And the same deal as before
I can do that
See you can sell guns wherever there's a demand and nobody gives a shit
He's acting like he's this big international arms dealer...  when come on face it the only people he ever sold to were dopers
Well he seems to be making out
Is it dead?
Yeah
Yeah well... so far he is
Oh..
I wouldn't go so far as to say that
He moves his lips when he reads
What does that tell you?
He's still a fuckup
He killed a man who worked for him the other day
Well  So what are you trying to tell me?
That I should get out of here?
That's not what I'm saying at al
You know where he went?
He went to go meet that stewardess
Please
Well I don't know
You live with him so  No I live here
Did he tell you about that half million he's got down in Mexico?
Uhhuh
Of course he did
He tells anybody who’s gonna listen
Well that's what him and that stewardess are doing
They're scheming on how they can get that money over here
and then just take it from them
just tried to stare me down ♪   Can I ask you a question?
Oh man
You ain't gonna get serious while we're in here chilling
It's just about Melanie
You know what?
I'm really sorry about that man  but I had to be somewhere all of a sudden
I figured well shit Louis ain't had no pussy for a while
So I thought let him kick it here with Mel
She didn't have to say shit
I know Melanie
That bitch is gonna be fucking you two minutes after I'm out the door
Melanie really good about throwing a fuck a nigger's way
Oh so she ain’t your girlfriend?
Is that what you thought?
No I wasn't sure
I didn't know
But you fucked her anyway?
Well...  the "not your girlfriend" part I felt more about
Oh
Oh oh shit
you know what is she to you?
You know she's just one of the bitches I got set up
I got Mel over in Hermosa Beach  and I rent this little place for Simone over in Compton where you’re staying  and about four blocks away I got this young 1 9yearold country girl named Sheronda
I found her on the bus stop two days out of Georgia  barefoot country as a chicken coop
Took her to my place in Compton told her it was Hollywood
She believed you?
Hell yeah
Closest she ever been anyway
But you trust Melanie around your business?
Oh
Yeah
See I knew it
I knew it
I knew it
See you didn't have to say nothing
I don't understand why you keep someone around your business and you can't even trust 'em
I ain't gotta trust her
I know her
I don't know what that means man
Well you can't trust Melanie  but you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie
Well I don't understand why you keep her the fuck around
I told you man
She's my fine little surfer girl
You have one message sent at 8:06 p.m.  Hi Jackie

Now the money's gonna be in a Dell Amo shopping bag all right?
I get some food sit down here in the food court then your girl comes in

Max
Hey
Well hello
I walked right past you
I know ignoring me
So what are you up to?
Just catching a movie
I called you last night
I know
I got your message
Ray wanted to have dinner with me so we can you know talk about the sting we're plotting
That's what he calls it a sting
He's been He's been really nice
You think he's got a thing for you?
Maybe
No
He just tries to act cool
You know I don't think there's anything wrong with that
He's just a young guy having fun being a cop
I know the type
Trust me on this
He's more interested in Ordell than he is in the money
If he does anything suspect it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction  but he wouldn't walk off with the money: it's evidence
If I was in Nicolet's place?
No I mean you right now not if you were somebody else
If I saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money would I take it?
You know where it came from
It's not like it's somebody's life savings
Half a million dollars will always be missed
You're avoiding the question Max
Okay sure I guess I'd be tempted  especially now since I'm getting out of the bail bond business
Why?
A lot of reasons
I'm tired of it
When did you decide?
It's been a long time coming  but I finally made up my mind
I guess it was... Thursday
Miss Brown?
Yes?
The night you got me out of jail?
Yeah
I went to pick up this guy
I sneak in and I'm waiting for him  Wait a minute
After we were together you snuck into a guy's house
Yeah
I went back to my office and found out that you took my gun  got another gun and the stun gun  went to this guy's house in Ell Monte and waited for him to come home
Shoot him with the stun gun
While he's incapacitated you cuff him and take him to County
You do that?
It's my job
Well the guy never came home
But I'm sitting on his couch in the dark holding my stun gun
And after a couple of hours I think  "What am I doing this?
It's 1 9 years of this shit.
And I make up my mind
That's it
I'm not sure you answered my question Max
Which one?
We gotta stop meeting like this
How was your flight?

Living with some 56yearold petty thief some woman named uh...  Hawkins Simone Hawkins
You know her
No
They ever talk about her?
Not yet
Okay who's the other one?
What's her deal?
It was her coke I got busted with
She knows everything
She's not a part of it  and she's pissed off that she's not a part of it
Well this is definitely somebody I wanna meet
Everything okay
Everything's the same except for one change
I told him Ordell’s changing the amount he's bringing in
Think they bought it?
Mm oh yeah
I got 'em thinking that Ordell’s real nervous  and they love thinking that he's scared of' em
You know a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit
Everything's the same except for one change
Ordell feels way too hot for him to bring in his money  and he knows you're watching him and he's fucking paranoid
So he's sweating a little bit
He's gonna keep his half mil where it is  but he's gonna bring in 50000 just in case he needs bail
It'll be more than that
Don't be so literal
Ray believed it
I'm not gonna show him the whole amount
He'll see 50000
And where's the rest of it?
In the bag underneath
What if he checks
He didn't before
You're taking a hell of a chance kid
Not really
If he finds it I'll say Mr. Walker put it in there...  and I didn't know anything about it like the coke
Well then you're out
You get nothing
Yeah but I'm not in jail...  and at least I tried
You're going to have surveillance all over you
That's why you don't make a move until I come out of that fitting room
Well a suit
There's this one I had my eye on
Hello
Look here we got a little change in plans
No no no no it ain't no thing
Everything's the same except one little difference
Well she wasn't here today 'cause she done split on my ass
Yeah
Me and Louis went by her pad
She gone
She gone her shit's gone and my 10000 motherfucking dollars is gone
Don't start buggin' on me
Goddamn it I'm telling you ain't nothing different
Now except for this time when we make the split  instead of Simone it's gonna be Melanie
I think someone's knocking on the door
Goddamn it Melanie got just as much sense as that bitch has she'd be in the same place
All right
Yeah later
Yeah
Well I'm gonna open it
Chicken shit
Okay the envelope contains $50000
Ever been tempted
What?
Mmhmm
If I did I'd have to give one to you wouldn't I?
Of course nobody knows how much there is
I guess we could take as much as we want
Isn't that right?
All those things are true
I mean it's not like the money belongs to anybody
That would be one point of view
Yeah
Once we make this evidence it belongs to us
You're officially out of trouble now
Don't go doing something stupid
How can I do anything stupid when I'm being watched every second?
Now look
Here's the deal
I want you to take all this cash
I want you to put it in this Bilingsley shopping bag
And that is exactly what I expect to see...  when I look inside Sheronda's Bilingsley shopping bag
Comprende
Si comprende
you couldn't make your court appearance
One you in a hospital; two you in jail; three you ass is dead
That means you're not my friend man

Where's Melanie?
Well that's what I wanna tell you
She got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag
And then she started runnin' her fuckin' mouth about you know like  'cause I couldn't remember where the car was parked right away when we came out
So then she got on me about that
"Is it this aisle Louis?
It was totally fuckin' with my nerves man
So what?
You left her there?
II shot her
Twice
In the parking lot
You couldn't talk to her?
Well how can you talk to her?
You know how she is
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe but at that time moment I don't know I  You shot her?
Is she dead?
II Pretty much
That ain't no fuckin' answer
Yes or no
Is she dead?
You think so?
Tell me Louis
Is she  She's dead
She's dead
In the chest and the stomach
If you had to do it then you had to do it brother
What we don't want is that bitch survivin' on us
Anybody but that woman
Louis?
Where's the rest of it?
How much is there?
I don't know
Maybe 40
Well you you said 550
Yeah so you light ain't you?
You light about half a million ten
That's the bag she came out with
She never put her hand in it
Neither did I
Came out of where?
The fitting room
It went down exactly the way it was supposed to
How long was she in there?
Not even a minute
She came right out
Louis you tellin' me the truth?
Listen I swear to God man
She came out with that fuckin' bag and I took it from her
And then what
We went to the parking lot
Where you shot her?
That's right
Louis you sure Melanie ain't in a room somewhere with a half million dollars..
I worked my ass off to get waitin' for you?
Oh fuck you for asking me that
Fuck you brother
She didn't ask you
Shit
Pull the car over a minute
All right so where's the gun you shot her with?
It's in there
Now what the fuck's that gonna tell ya
I could've taken two out already
♪♪   It's Jackie Brown
Oh I'll be sure and ask that bitch before I blow her brains out
Well maybe the Feds got it
Uhuh uhuh uhuh
See if there wasn't nothin' in that bag but them towels  then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money...  out of her suitcase and the A.T.F
got it
But she put them books in there to trick our ass
Well that's why I didn't check it
That's right
And then she puts 40 grand or so in there to rub that shit in my face
You know what I'm sayin'?
She wants me to know she ripped me off
I don't know
Unless you know either she's got it or the Feds got it
Or Or Now check this out
What if she gave the money to somebody else first...  before Melanie even went in the dressing room
Uhhuh
Oh man
You know what?
Do you know who I saw in the dress department?
No tell me
I didn't think anything of it
I No no I did wonder what he was doin' there
Like maybe he was with his wife or his girlfriend
It's a big place  Louis Louis Louis
You gonna tell me who you saw?
Yeah Max Cherry
You see that motherfucker in the dress department when we about to get a half million dollars
And you don't think nothin' about him bein' there?
No
Do they know each other?
Hell yeah they know each other
You know your bail bondsmen
You know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes don't you?
Why should I think something's weird if I don't know nothin' about them knowin' each other?
I don't wanna hear no fuckin' excuses Louis
I ain't givin' you excuses
But I'm tellin' you I don't fuckin' I'm givin' you fuckin' reasons
Oh you gonna tell me the reason...  you lost every goddamned cent I got in the world?
Hey Hey man
You better  Let me tell you the reason motherfucker
The reason is your ass ain't worth a shit no more
What the fuck happened to you man?
Her ass used to be beautiful
I thought I did
Yeah well you didn't
You know if it’s me...  and I got all that shit hangin' over my head like you got hangin' over yours  I don't know I'd go shoppin' later
Well I got there early
You see I've had my eye on this suit...  that I've wanted and well I'm just gonna go try it on   Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait wait wait
Just wait a fuckin' second all right?
I got there early
The idea was to try on the suit see if I liked it
If I did they would wrap it up and I would put back on my uniform...  'cause Sheronda is expecting me to wear it
Meet Sheronda give her the shopping bag with the $50000 and go home
Yeah but you didn't do that
Because I couldn't
Melanie burst in
She grabbed the bag
And then somebody fuckin' killed her for it
What happened to the bag she gave you?
She didn't give me a bag
Melanie was not a part of the plan
That's why she came into the dressing room grabbed the bag took off
But I couldn't go after her because I was in my fucking underwear
And I had to put on this suit because I could put it on faster than my uniform   You had time to pay the sales chick
Ray I was frantic
What was I supposed to do?
All right what you do after that?
I went lookin' for you
And I went back to the place in the mal...  where you were before but you weren't there
You didn't tell me how to do that
There was a guy with Melanie?
Okay
You've no idea what happened to the $50000
You're clueless right?
You've no idea where the 50 grand is?
None
You have no idea It could've gone here could've gone there?
I know nothin'
Not a clue
Not even a little idea
A maybe
Not a tiny motherfuckin' idea
You'd take a polygraph?
Yeah if it'd motherfuckin' make you happy
Yeah put it right there
Man
I sure hope you didn't do anything stupid Jackie
Can I talk to you for a second?
Louis Gara's dead
L.A.P.D
And we lost Ordell
I thought you were fuckin' watchin' him
We were and we lost him
He walked into a strip bar sometime around 3:30 and never came out
The bar was on Ninth what less than a mile and a half from where they found Louis
It looks like Louis' buddy shot him twice pointblank range
We pick up Ordell
We got three murders we can link him to and we got you
What about you?
You think I took some of that money?
Hey I have no evidence of you doin' anything
You didn't pay for that snazzy new suit with marked bills
I'm glad to see that
You gave us Melanie
You gave us Louis
Melanie was found with a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts
I'll settle for Ordell with marked bills
But if there's anything else...  you haven't told me about you know what that's between you and Ordell
I just got one thing to say
You better hope we find him before he finds you
I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till I get my motherfuckin' money
Come on man if it wasn't for me you wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat
Oh yeah yeah right
Hello?
Motherfucker hung up on me
You believe that shit?
Ingrate nigger
Motherfuck
Shit
Goddamn girl
How you live like this?
Like what?
Like this
This some repugnant shit
Yeah Max there?
He ain't here right now man
Out of town?
He's around man
Well give me his home number
All right
Break out the beeper number nigger
♪     Yeah
I've been looking for you
Do you know who this is?
This is Mr. Robbie isn't it?
I have your 10000
The bond collateral that you put down on Beaumont Livingston...  and moved over to Miss Brown remember?
They decided to nofile this morning
Tell me where you are
I'll come give you your money
You still there?
Look here man
And I know you know what I want
And Jackie can tell me any story comes into her pretty little head  as long as at the end of that story she hands me my motherfuckin' money
Now she wanna be my friend she do that
And if she go to the police  you tell her I will name her ass as my accessory
And we'll go upstate hand in handcuffed motherfuckin' hand
And that's a promise
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
You tell her that and I'll call you back
It was Ordell
If you have time do you think you could find out where he's stayin' for me?
Cops can't locate him huh?
They don't have your winning personality
Sure thing
I think I do
Good enough?
You bet
You lookin' to get shot?
I thought you might be asleep
You keep fuckin' with me you the one gonna be asleep forever
I'm alone
Get your ass in the house
No freeze motherfucker
What you doin'?
This al?
I have a receipt for you to sign
No no no motherfucker
You talked to her?
She wants to give you your money
How'd you find me anyway?
Winston found you
How'd he find me?
That's what he does
He finds people that don't wanna be found
So she wanna give me my money huh?
Yeah
She wants to give it to you herself and she wants to collect her ten percent
She also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it
Turn around
Put your hands on your head
Why don’t you tell me why?
Jackie didn't trust Melanie
What she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money
And you helped her didn’t you?
Y'all went to all that trouble just to protect my interest?
In a way yes
My ass may be dumb but I ain't no dumb ass
Go over there and sit on that couch
Don't worry about her
Sit down
Place stinks
You get used to it
Where my money at?
Where Jackie at?
She's been there since Thursday night
If she want to talk to me how come she wasn't home?
She's afraid
Oh right
That I gotta see
She still is
Tell her to bring the money over here
It's in the safe: she can't
Call her and give her the combination
Look I'm tellin' you you got her spooked
Oh you expect me to just go walkin' in there?
If she wanted to set you up you'd be in custody by now
When you told her that you'd name her as an accessory that scared her more than anything
Mmm
Then that's why she wanted to give me my money ain't it?
It ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about Melanie huh?
See I ain't trust Melanie either but I could handle her
And I told that fuckin' Louis all he had to do was hit her in the mouth
But no he had to shoot her
Jackie's at your office huh?
She by herself?
That bigass nigger Winston ain't there is he?
She's all alone
All right
She will
I'll be here
See you in a bit
Goddamn
In all the time I've known her  I ain't never heard her scared like that

II hesitated takin' that much
Well I'm leavin' now and you know I'm all packed up ready to go   That's Ordell’s

Sarah I cannot believe you are early
What you gonna do now huh
I got your ass
Remember that
Remember
Okay
Come on bitch
Come on
Bring it on
Mommy I'm home
How was school
Mommy what happened to you and the TV room
Oh
That's what happened baby
Barney did this
Baby now you can't come in here
This is an old friend of mommy's I ain't seen in a long time
Hi honey
I'm  What's your name
Her name is Nikki
Such a pretty name for such a pretty girl
How old are you Nikki
Nikki asked you a question
I'm 4
4 years old eh
You know I had a little girl once
She'd be about 4 now
You can go in your room now
Okay
Nikkia
In your room
Now
You want some coffee
Yeah
This Pasadena homemaker's name  is Jeanne Bell
Her husband is Dr. Lawrence Bell
But back when we were acquainted four years ago  her name was Vernita Green
Mine Black Mamba
Do you have a towel
Yeah
Thanks
Yeah
So I suppose it's a little late for an apology
You suppose correctly
Look bitch I need to know  if you're gonna start more shit around my baby girl
I'm not gonna murder you in front of your child okay
That's being more rational  than Bill led me to believe you were capable of
It's mercy compassion and forgiveness I lack
Not rationality
I know I fucked you over
I fucked you over bad
I wish to God I hadn't but I did
You have every right to want to get even
No
To get even even Stephen  I would have to kill you go up to Nikki's room kill her  then wait for your husband to come home and kill him
That'd be about square
Look if I could go back in a machine I would
But I can't
All I can tell you is that I'm a different person now
Oh great
Be that as it may  I know I don't deserve your mercy or your forgiveness
However I beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter
Bitch you can stop right there
Just because I have no wish to murder you  before the eyes of your daughter  does not mean parading her around in front of me  is gonna inspire sympathy
You and I have unfinished business
And not a goddamn fucking thing you've done  in the subsequent four years  including getting knocked up is gonna change that
It all depends
Tomorrow
The day after tomorrow
How about tonight bitch
Splendid
Where
There's a baseball diamond where I coach little league  about a mile from here
We meet there around 2:30 in the morning  dressed all in black your hair in a black stocking
And we have us a knife fight
Now I have to fix Nikki's cereal
Bill said you were one of the best ladies he saw  with an edged weapon
Fuck you bitch
So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass Black Mamba
Black Mamba
I should have been motherfucking Black Mamba
If you wanna stick with your butcher knife that's fine
Very funny bitch
Very funny
It was not my intention to do this in front of you
But you can take my word for it
Your mother had it coming
When you grow up if you still feel raw about it..
I'll be waiting
For those regarded as warriors..
Suppress all human emotion and compassion...  ...kill whoever stands in thy way even if that be Lord God or Buddha himself
Come on out to Dallas
This is Rockabilly Rhythms on KTRN Wichita Falls
And next we got some record
Very own wild man Charlie Feathers
It's a goddamn massacre Pop
They wiped out the whole wedding party execution style
Give me a figure
Nine dead bodies
And we're talking the whole shebang
Bride
Reverend
Reverend's wife
They even shot that old colored fella that plays the organ
It would appear somebody objected to this  and wasn't able to hold their peace
Good gravy Marie
What'd I tell you Pop
You're in a house of worship
Sorry Pop
Well this is definitely the work of professionals
I'd guesstimate Mexican Mafia hit squad
Four maybe five strong
How can you tell
Well a sure and steady hand did this
This is the work of a salty dog
You can tell by the cleanliness of the carnage
Now a killcrazy rampage though it may be  all the colors are kept inside the lines
If you was a moron you could almost admire it
Who's the bride
The name on the marriage certificate  is Arlene Machiavelli
That's a fake
You can tell she was pregnant
Man would have to be a mad dog  to shoot a goddamn goodlooking gal like that in the head
Haycolored hair
Big eyes
She's a little bloodspattered ngel
Son Number One
Yeah
This tall drink of cocksucker ain't dead
I might never have liked you
But that shouldn't suggest that I don't respect you
My gift to you
For fuck's sake
Hello Bill
What's her condition
Comatose
Where is she
That's my girl
Elle you're going to abort the mission
What
We owe her better than that
Oh you don't owe her shit
You don't owe her shit
Speak
Y'all beat the hell out of that woman
But you didn't kill her
And I put a bullet in her head
Now you saw that yourself  with your own beautiful blue eye did you not
We've done a lot of things to this lady
And if she ever wakes up we'll do a whole lot more
But one thing we won't do  is sneak into her room in the night like a filthy rat  and kill her in her sleep
Don't you agree Miss Driver
I guess
Do you really have to guess
No
I don't really have to guess
I know
Affirmative
I love you very much
I love you too
Byebye
Thought that was pretty fucking funny didn't you
Word of advice shithead
Bill it's your baby
Oh my baby
Four years
Four years
The price is $75 a fuck my friend
You getting your freak on or what
Oh yeah boy
Yeah
Now here's the rules
Rule number one
Nurse comes in and she got a shiner  or less some teeth jig's up
So no knuckle sandwiches under no circumstances
And by the way this cunt's a spitter
It's a motorreflex thing
Now are clear on rule one
Yeah
Good
Now rule number two
No monkey bites no hickeys
In fact no leaving no marks of no kind
Now her plumbing down there don't work
So feel free to come in her all you want
Try not to make a mess
I'll be back in 20
Yeah
Oh shit
By the way not all the time but sometimes  this chick's cooch can get drier than a bucket of sand
If she dry lube up with this and you'll be good to go
Oh yeah
Oh God damn
You are the bestlooking girl I've had today
Yo stud
Coming in ready or not
Hey buddy did you have yourself a good time
Where's Bill
Where's Bill
Where's Bill
I don't know who Bill is
Well ain't you the slice of cutie pie they said you was
Jane Doe huh
We don't know shit about you do we
My name is Buck and I'm here to fuck
Your name is Buck
Right
And you came here to fuck
Right
Wait
"Pussy Wagon.
You fucker
Texas
Okay
Wiggle your big toe
Wiggle your big toe
Wiggle your big toe
Wiggle your big toe
As I lay in the back of Buck's truck  trying to will my limbs out of entropy...  Wiggle your big toe
And the dicks responsible
Members all of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad
When fortune smiles on something  as violent and ugly as revenge  it seems proof like no other that not only does God exist  you're doing his will
But when one manages the difficult task  of becoming queen of the Tokio underworld  one doesn't keep it a secret does one
The halfJapanese halfChinese American Army brat  made her first acquaintance with death at the age of 9
It was at that age she witnessed  the death of her parents at the hands  of Japan's most ruthless yakuza boss Boss Matsumoto
Mommy
She swore revenge
Luckily for her Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile
At 11 she got her revenge
Look at me Matsumoto...  ...take a good look at my face
Look at my eyes
Do I look like somebody...  you murdered?
By 20 she was one of the top female assassins in the world
At 25 she did her part in the killing  of nine innocent people including my unborn daughter  in a small wedding chapel in El Paso Texas
But on that day four years ago she made one big mistake
She should have killed 10
However before satisfaction would be mine  first things first
Wiggle your big toe
Now let's get these other piggies wiggling
May I help you
Okinawa
Oneway
Hi
Welcome..
Welcome
You English
Almost
American
Welcome American
Domo

Can you speak Japanese
No no
Just a few words I learned since yesterday
Um may I sit at the bar
Oh sure sure sure
Please sit
What other words did you learn
Bring out some tea quickly
I'm watching my soap operas
Lazy bastard...  Screw your soap opera..
Hurry up
The tea's hot
Why don't you serve it yourself for once
Get your ass out here
Uh excuse me
Uh what other Japanese do you know
Oh let's see
"Arigato.
Good
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
"Konnitchiwa.
"Kohnneecheewah.
Konnichi wa
Please repeat
Konnichi wa
Perfect
You say Japanese word like you Japanese
Oh you're making fun of me
No no no no
Pronunciation very good
You say arigato like we say arigato
Well thank you
You should learn Japanese
Very easy
I heard it was kind of hard
Most difficult
But you have Japanese tongue
Okay okay
Oh
Hey what the hell happened to the tea
Hurry up... goddammit
Lazy oaf...  What d'ya want
I beg your pardon
Oh yes
A bottle of warm sake please
Warm sake
Very good
One warm sake
In the middle of the day
Day night afternoon  Who gives a damn Get the sake
You listen well...  For thirty years you make the fish I get the sake
If this were the military  I'd be General by now
Oh so you'd be General huh
If you were General I'd be Emperor  and you'd still get the sake   and you'd still get the sake  So shut up and get the sake
Do you understand
I shaved my head
Do you understand me
Sorry
Oh
Oh oh
Uhhuh
Oh
What brings you to Okinawa
Oh yeah
You have a friend live in Okinawa
Not quite
Not friend
I never met him
Who is he
May I ask
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo
I need Japanese steel
Why do you need Japanese steel
I have vermin to kill
You must have big rats you need Hattori Hanzo's steel
Huge
May I
You may
Try the second one down
Funny
I like baseball
I wanted to show you these
However...  ...someone as you who knows so much must surely know..
What I have here..
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value
Yet proud as I am of my life's work..
...I have retired
These are not for sale
I didn't say "sell me.
I said "give me.
Why should I help you
Because my vermin is a former student of yours
And considering the student  I'd say you have a rather large obligation
You can sleep here
I suggest you spend it practicing
I've completed doing...  ...what I swore an oath to God 28 years ago  ...to never do again
I have created "something that kills people.
And in that purpose I was a success
If on your journey you should encounter God...  ...God will be cut
Yellowhaired warrior...  Go
Domo
It was one year after the massacre in El Paso Texas  that Bill backed his Nippon progeny  financially and philosophically in her  Shakespearianinmagnitude power struggle  with the other yakuza clans  over who would rule vice in the city of Tokio
When the final sword was sheathed  it was ORen Ishii and her powerful posse...  ...the Crazy 88 that proved the victor
The pretty lady to ORen's right  who's dressed like she's a villain on "Star Trek"  is ORen's lawyer best friend and second lieutenant
The halfFrench halfJapanese Sofie Fatale
Another former protegee of Bill's
Gogo may be young but what she lacks in age  she makes up for in madness
Ferrari... ltalian trash
Do you want to screw me
Don't laugh
Do you want to screw me yes or no
Yes
How 'bout now big boy
Do you still wish to penetrate me...  ...or is it I...  ...or is it I... who has penetrated you
The bald guy in the black suit and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo  the head general of ORen's personal army the Crazy 88
And just in case you were wondering  how could a halfbreed JapaneseChinese American  become the boss of all bosses in Tokio Japan  I'll tell you
The subject of ORen's blood and nationality  came up before the council only once
The man who seems bound and determined  to break the mood is Boss Tanaka
And what Boss Tanaka thinks is...  Boss Tanaka
This is a time for celebration
And what exactly are we celebrating
The perversion of our illustrious council
Tanaka have you gone mad
I will not tolerate this
Apologize
TanakaSan of what perversion do you speak
My father...  ...along with yours  and along with yours started this council
And while...  ...you laugh like stupid donkeys...  ...they weep in the afterlife..
...over the perversion committed today
Outrageous
Tanaka it is you who insults this council
Fuck face
Gentlemen
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind
By all means allow him to express it
I speak of the perversion done to this council  ...which I love...  ...more than my own children  ...by making a Chinese JapAmerican half breed bitch its leader
So that you understand how serious I am..
As your leader..
I encourage you from time to time  and always in a respectful manner to question my logic
If you're unconvinced  a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest  tell me so
But allow me to convince you
And I promise you right here and now  no subject will ever be taboo
Just like this fucker here
Now if any of you sons of bitches  got anything else to say now is the fucking time
I didn't think so
Gentlemen this meeting is adjourned
One ticket to Tokio please
Moshi moshi
Hey
Hey yeah
Gogo
They demand ridiculous things
Shut up... Do you know what would happen if they heard you
What's gonna happen
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan
No I don't want that
Yes it's me
And if you give us a contact number we will get back to you
Who do you remind me of
You're right he does look like Charlie Brown
Charlie Brown
Four pepperoni pizzas
That's not on our menu..
Hey... hey... Charlie give me a kiss
ORen Ishii
You and I have unfinished business
Charlie Brown beat it
Miki
TEAR THE BITCH APART
So ORen any more subordinates for me to kill
Gogo right
Bingo
Our reputations precede us
Don't they
Gogo I know you feel you must protect your mistress
Walk away
You call that begging
You can beg better than that
You didn't think it was gonna be that easy did you
You know for a second there yeah I kind of did
Silly rabbit
Trix are for..
Kids
#  # Ain't nobody doin' but me baby #  # Nobody but me #  # Well let me tell you nobody #  # Nobody but me #  # Well let me tell you nobody #  # Nobody #  This is what you get for fucking around with yakuzas
Go home to your mother
Those of you lucky enough to still have your lives...  ...take them with you
However...  ...leave the limbs you've lost
Except you Sofie
You stay right where you are
Your instrument is quite impressive
Where was it made
Okinawa
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel
YOU LIE
Swords however never get tired
I hope you've saved your energy
If you haven't...  ...you might not last five minutes
Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords
But you can at least die like a samurai
Attack me...  ...with everything you have
For ridiculing you earlier..
...I apologize
Accepted
Ready
Come on
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword
Sofie
My Sofie
Please
Please forgive my betrayal
No more of that
But still..
Except my aching heart over what she's done  to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie
I've kept you alive for two reasons
The first reason is information
Burn in Hell you stupid stupid blonde
I'll tell you nothing
But I am gonna ask you questions
And every time you don't give me answers  I'm gonna cut something off
And I promise you they will be things you will miss
Give me your other arm
I want all the information on the Deadly Vipers
Why she left you alive...  And where I can find them
Guessing won't be necessary
She informed me
She said I could keep my wicked life for two reasons
As I said before  I've allowed you to keep your wicked life for two reasons
And the second reason is so you can tell him in person  everything that happened here tonight
I want him to witness the extent of my mercy  by witnessing your deformed body
I want you to tell him all the information you just told me
I want him to know I want him to know
Revenge is never a straight line
It's a forest
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...  ...to get lost... to forget where you came in
That woman deserves her revenge
And we deserve to die
How did you find me
I'm the man
One more thing Sofie
Is she aware her daughter is still alive
Your Mandarin is lousy
It causes my ears discomfort
You bray like an ass
You are not to speak unless spoken to
Is it too much to hope... you understand Cantonese
I speak Japanese very well..
I asked if you understand Cantonese
A little
If you can't understand me..
I will communicate with you like l would a dog
When l yell when l point when l beat you with my stick
Bill is your master is he not
Yes he is
Your master tells me... you're not entirely unschooled
I am proficient in TigerCrane Style  And l am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the Samurai sword
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword
Don't make me laugh
Your anger amuses me
Do you believe you are my match
No
Are you aware l kill at will
Is it your wish to die
No
Then you must be stupid...  Then you must be stupid... so stupid
Rise and let me look at your ridiculous face
Rise
What's the matter
Cat got your tongue
Oh yes you speak Japanese
Go to that rack
Remove the sword
Let's see how good you really are
From here you can get an excellent view of my foot
Your swordsmanship... is amateur at best
Your socalled kungfu... is really... quite pathetic
I asked you to demonstrate... what you know... and you did...  Not a goddamn thing
Like all Yankee women...  ... all you can do is order in restaurants and spend a man's money
Excruciating... isn't it
If it was my wish...  ... l could chop your arm off
No please don't
It's my arm now
l can do what l please
I can't
Because you're helpless
Yes
Have you ever felt this before
Compared to me... you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle
YES!!
THAT'S THE BEGlNNlNG
Ls it your wish to possess this kind of power
Yes
Your training will begin... tomorrow
Since your arm now belongs to me...  ... l want it strong
Can you do that
Then you can't do it
What if your enemy... is three inches in front of you...  ... What do you do then...  ... Curl into a ball...  ... or do you put your FlST through him
Now begin
No wonder you can't do it... you acquiesce to defeat...   before you even begin
If you want to eat like a dog...  You can live and sleep outside like a dog
If you want to live and sleep like a human...  ... pick up those sticks
Come on you bitch
Here l come
Elle you treacherous dog
It's too risky
I'm through doing that shit
You always say that
The same thing every time
"I'm through never again too dangerous.
I know that's what I always say
You forget about it in a day or two
The days of me forgetting are over
The days of me remembering have just begun
You know when you go on like this what you sound like
You sound like a duck
Quack quack quack
Take heart 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again
After tonight
Correct
Can I get anyone more coffee
Oh yes
Thank you
You're welcome
I mean the way it is now you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank
Banks are easier
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery
They're insured
I don't even need a gun in a federal bank
Heard about this one bloke he walks into a bank with a portable phone
He gives the phone to a teller
The bloke on the other end says...  "We got this guy's little girl
If you don't give him all your money we're gonna kill her.
Fuckin' right it worked
That's what I'm talkin' about
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone...  not a pistol not a shotgun a fuckin' phone
Cleans the place out
They don't lift a fuckin' finger
Did they hurt the little girl
There probably never was a little girl
You want to rob banks
I'm not saying I wanna rob banks
I'm illustrating if we did it'd be easier than what we've been doing
No more liquor stores
Yeah no more liquor stores
Besides it ain't the giggle it used to be
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores
Vietnamese Koreans don't even speak fuckin' English
You tell 'em empty out the register they don't know what you're talkin' about
We keep on one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him
I'm not gonna kill anybody
I don't want to kill anybody either
But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them
And if it's not the gooks...  it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations
You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand
Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone
Forget it
We're out of it
Well what then day jobs
Not in this life
<i>Garcon coffee!</i>  This place
This place
A coffee shop
What's wrong with that
Nobody ever robs restaurants
Why not
Bars liquor stores...  gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them
Restaurants on the other hand you catch with their pants down
Not as expectin' anyway
I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this
Correct
Manager
He don't give a fuck
Waitresses
Fuckin' forget it
No way they're takin' a bullet for the register
Busboys
Some wetback gettin' paid $1 .50 an hour...  really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner
Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths they don't know what's goin' on
See I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up remember
All the customers kept comin' in
Yeah
Now that was a good idea
Thank you
Made more from the wallets than we did from the register
Yes we did
A lot of people come to restaurants
Pretty smart huh
Pretty smart
I'm ready
Right now right here
Come on
All right
Same as last time remember
I'll handle the employees
I love you pumpkin
I love you honey bunny
Everybody be cool
This is a robbery
Any of you fucking pricks move...  and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you
Okay what you want to know
Yeah it's legal but it ain't 100% legal
You just can't walk into a restaurant roll a joint and start puffin' away
I mean they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places
Those are hash bars
Yeah
It breaks down like this
It's legal to own it
And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar it's legal to sell it
It's illegal to carry it but that doesn't matter 'cause get a load of this
I mean that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have
Oh man
I'm goin'
That's all there is to it
I'm fuckin' goin'
I know baby
But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is
It's the little differences
I mean they got the same shit over there that they got here...   but it's just there it's a little different
Example
You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer
And in Paris you can buy a beer in McDonald's
You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese
They wouldn't know what the fuck a quarterpounder is
What do they call it
They call it a Royale with Cheese
Royale with Cheese
What do they call a Big Mac
Big Mac's a Big Mac but they call it Le Big Mac
Le Big Mac
What do they call a Whopper
I don't know
I didn't go into Burger King
What
Mayonnaise
Goddamn
They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit
Yuck
We should have shotguns for this kind of deal
How many up there
Three or four
That's countin' our guy
It's possible
We should have fuckin' shotguns
What's her name
Mia
Mia
I don't know
However people meet people
She used to be a actress
Oh really
She do anything I'd have seen
I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot
What's a pilot
I don't watch TV
Yeah but you are aware that there is an invention called television...  and on this invention they show shows right
Yeah
The way they pick TV shows is they make one show
That show's called a pilot
Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows...  and on the strength of that one show they decide if they wanna make more shows
Some get chosen and become television programs
She starred in one of the ones that became nothing
You remember Antwan Rockamora
Halfblack halfSamoan
Yeah maybe
Fat right
I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat
He got a weight problem
I mean what's a nigger gonna do
I think I know who you mean
Marsellus fucked him up good
Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife
So what he'd do
Fuck her
No no no no no
Nothin' that bad
Well then what then
He gave her a foot massage
Then what'd Marsellus do
Sent a couple cats over to his place
They took him out on his patio
Threw his ass over the balcony
Nigger fell four stories
He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass like a greenhouse
Since then he kind of developed a speech impediment
That's a damn shame
What do you mean
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage
You don't think he overreacted
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did but he had to expect a reaction
It was a foot massage
A foot massage is nothin'
I give my mother a foot massage
I mean is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out
No but it's the same fuckin' ballpark
Stop right there
Eatin' the bitch out and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing
It's the same ballpark
Now look maybe your method of massage differs from mine
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...  ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport
Foot massages don't mean shit
Have you ever given a foot massage
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages
I'm the foot fuckin' master
You given a lot of them
Shit yeah
Would you give a guy a foot massage
Fuck you
You give 'em a lot
Fuck you
You know I'm kind of tired
I could use a foot massage
Yo yo yo man
You best back off
This is the door
What time you got
7:22 in the a.m.  No it ain't quite time yet
Come on
Let's hang back
Now look just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right...  for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin' house...  fuckin' up the way the nigger talks; that shit ain't right
Motherfucker do that shit to me he better paralyze my ass 'cause I kill the motherfucker
I'm sayin' it does
Now look I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...  where you don't talk about it but you know it and she knows it
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it
That's his fuckin' wife man
This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit
You know what I'm sayin'
It's an interestin' point
Come on
Let's get into character
What's her name again
Mia
Why you so interested in big man's wife
He's goin' out of town Florida
And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone
Take care of her
Show her a good time
Make sure she don't get lonely
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date
It is not a date
It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'
It's just good company that's all
It's not a date
Hey kids
How you boys doin'
Hey keep chillin'
We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace
You do remember your business partner don't you
Now let me take a wild guess here
Yeah
I thought so
You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace don't ya Brett
Yeah I remember
Good
Looks like me and Vincent caught you boys at breakfast
Sorry about that
Hamburgers
Hamburgers
The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast
What kind of hamburgers

Vincent
You ever had a Big Kahuna burger
Want a bite
I ain't hungry
Well if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime
Me I can't usually get 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian...  which pretty much makes me a vegetarian
You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France
No
Tell 'em Vincent
A Royale with Cheese
You know why they call it that
Because of the metric system
Check out the big brain on Brett
You're a smart motherfucker
That's right
The metric system
Sprite
Good
You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with
Go right ahead
That hit the spot
You
Flock of Seagulls
Why don't you tell my man Vince here where you got the shit hid at
It's over..
You were sayin'
It's in the cupboard
No the one by your knees
Vincent
We happy
Yeah we happy
Look I'm sorry
I didn't get your name
I got yours
Right
But I never got yours
No no no
I just want you to know how..
I just want you to know how sorry we are that things got so fucked up...  with us and Mr. Wallace
We got into this thing with the best intentions
I never  Oh I'm sorry did I break your concentration
I didn't mean to do that
Please
Continue
You were saying something about ""best intentions.
What's the matter
Oh well allow me to retort
What does Marsellus Wallace look like
What country you from
What
"What" ain't no country I ever heard of
They speak English in What
What
English Motherfucker
Yes
Then you know what I'm sayin'
Describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like
What
I  Say ' "what" again
Say "what" again
I double dare you motherfucker
Say ""what" one more goddamn time
He's black
Go on
He's bald
Does he look like a bitch
What
No
Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch Brett
I didn't
Yes you did
Yes you did Brett
No no
You read the Bible Brett
Yes
Well there's this passage I got memorized
Sort of fits this occasion
"The path of the righteous man..."  is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish...  and the tyranny of evil men
Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill...  shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness...  for he is truly his brother's keeper...  and the finder of lost children
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
And you will know my name is the Lord...  "when I lay my vengeance upon thee!
I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker
The thing is Butch...  right now... you got ability
But painful as it may be ability... don't last
And your days are just about over
But that's a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about
You see this business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers
Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine
If you mean it turns to Vinegar... it does
If you mean it gets better with age... it don't
Two
Boxers don't have an oldtimers' day
You came close but you never made it
And if you were gonna make it you would have made it before now
You my nigger
Certainly appears so
That's pride fuckin' with you
Fuck pride
Pride only hurts
You fight through that shit
I got no problem with that Mr. Wallace

And some matches
Thanks
It's as if it turns every part of your body into the tip of a penis
It's a great book on piercing
That gun to pierce your ears they don't use that to pierce your nipples do they
That guns goes against the entire idea behind piercing
All my piercing 18 places on my body every one of 'em done with a needle
Five in each ear one through the nipple of my left breast...  two in my right nostril one in my left eyebrow...  one in my belly one in my lip one in my clit...   and I wear a stud in my tongue
Excuse me
I was just curious...  but... why would you wear a stud in your tongue
Helps fellatio
Step in my office
This is Panda from Mexico
Very good stuff
Now that's Bava
And that is Choco from the Harz Mountains of Germany
Now the first two are the same
300 a gram
Those are friend prices
But this one is a little more expensive
This is 500 a gram
But when you shoot it you will know where that extra money went
This is real real real good shit
But this one is a fuckin' madman
Remember I just got back from Amsterdam
Am I a nigger
No
You're in my home
Now white people who know the difference...  between good shit and bad shit this is the house they come to
Now my shit I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...   any old day of the fuckin' week
This ain't Amsterdam Vince
This is a seller's market
Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead
Heroin it's comin' back in a big fuckin' way
Gimme three grams of madman
Okay
Now if it's as good as you say it is I'll come back and buy another thousand

It'd been worth him doin' it just so I could've caught him
What a fucker
What's more chickenshit than fuckin' with a man's automobile
You don't do it
It's just against the rules
Thank you
Thank you

<i>To lonesome town.</i>  <i>To cry my troubles away.</i>  Could you... roll me one of those cowboy
You can have this one cowgirl
Thanks
<i>Lay me down in lonesome town.</i>  <i> I can learn to forget</i>  So...  Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam
Sure did
Just over three years
I go there about once a year to chill out for a month
No kiddin'
I didn't know that
Why would you
I heard you did a pilot
That was my 15 minutes
It was a show about a team of female secret agents called Fox Force Five
<i> Fox Force Five.</i>  Fox as in were a bunch of foxy chicks
Force as in we're a force to be reckoned with
And five as in there's onetwothreefourfive of us
There was a blond one Sommerset O'Neal
The Japanese fox was a Kung Fu master
The black girl was a demolition expert
French Fox's specialty was sex
What was your specialty
The character I played Raven McCoy...  her background was she grew up raised by circus performers
According to the show she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife
And she knew a zillion old jokes
Her grandfather an old vaudevillian taught her
And if we would have got picked up they would've worked in a gimmick...  where every show I would've told another joke
You know any of them old jokes
Well I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show
It's corny
Don't be that way
No you wouldn't like it and I'd be embarrassed
You'd be embarrYou told 50 million people and you can't tell me
I promise I won't laugh
That's not what I meant
You know it
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much
What a gyp
Vanilla coke
Yummy
You think I could have a sip of that
Be my guest
I gotta know what a fivedollar shake tastes like
You can use my straw
Yeah but maybe I do
Cooties I can handle
All right
Told ya
I don't know if it was worth five dollars but it's pretty fuckin' good
Don't you hate that
Hate what
Uncomfortable silences
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable
That's a good question
That's when you know you found somebody really special
When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence
We just met each other
I'll tell you what
You sit here... and think of something to say
I'll do that
Okay
I said goddamn
Goddamn
I need some hair spray
Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom...  to find your food waiting for you
We're lucky we got anything at all
I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter
Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section
Which one
That is Marilyn Monroe
That is Mamie Van Doren
I don't see Jayne Mansfield so she must have the night off
Pretty smart
Yeah
I got my moments
So did you think of somethin' to say
Actually I did
I don't want to offend you
This doesn't sound like the usual mindless boring gettin'toknowyou chitchat
This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say
Well well I do
But you have to promise not to be offended
No no
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me
You can ask me what you're gonna ask me...  and my natural response could be to get offended
Then through no fault of my own I would have broken my promise
Let's just forget it
That's an impossibility
Is that a fact
And besides...  isn't it more exciting when you don't have permission
All right all right
Well here goes
Who's Antwan
Tony Rocky Horror
He fell out of a window
Well that is one way to say it
Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out
Yet even another way...  is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you
Is that a fact
No
No it's not a fact
It's just what I heard
That's just what I heard
Who told you
"They" talk a lot don't they
They certainly do
They certainly do
Don't be shy Vincent
What else did ""they" say
No no no no no
They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage
And
And nothin'
That's it
You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourthstory window...  for giving me a foot massage
And you believe that
Well at the time I was told it sounded reasonable
No it seemed excessive but that doesn't mean it didn't happen
I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you
A husband being protective of his wife is one thing
A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it... at my wedding
Really
When you little scamps get together you're worse than a sewing circle
Ladies and gentlemen
Now the moment you've all been waiting for
The worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest
Now this is where one lucky couple...  will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding
Right here
All right
No no no no no
No no no no no
I do believe Marsellus my husband your boss...  told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted
Now I wanna dance; I wanna win; I want that trophy
All right
You asked for it
Let's hear it for our first contestants
Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening
Young lady what is your name
Mrs. Mia Wallace
Vincent Vega
All right let's see what you can do
Go for it
Come on
<i>It was a teenage wedding</i> <i>and the old folks wished them well.</i>  <i>You could see that Pierre</i> <i>did truly love the mademoiselle.</i>  <i>And now the young monsieur and madame</i> <i>have rung the chapel bell.</i>  <i>C'estlavie say the old folks</i> <i>It goes to show you never can tell.</i>  <i>They furnished off an apartment</i> <i>with a tworoom Roebucks sale.</i>  <i>The 'cooleradorwas crammed</i> <i>with TV dinners and ginger ale.</i>  <i>But when Pierre found work</i> <i>the little money comin' worked out well.</i>  <i>C'estlavie say the old folks</i> <i>It goes to show you never can tell.</i>  <i>They had a hifi phono</i> <i>and boy did they let it blast.</i>  <i>Seven hundred little records</i> <i>all rock rhythm and jazz.</i>  <i>But when the sun went down</i> <i>the rapid tempo of the music fell.</i>  <i>C'estlavie say the old folks</i> <i>It goes to show you never can tell.</i>  <i>They had a teenage wedding</i> <i>and the old folks wished them well.</i>  <i>You could see that Pierre</i> <i>did truly love the mademoiselle.</i>  Is that what you call an uncomfortable silence
I don't know what you call that
Drinks
Music
I'm gonna take a piss
<i>Girl.</i>  <i>Bomp bomp bom.</i>  <i>You'll be a woman soon.</i>  <i>I love you so much</i> <i>Can't count all the ways.</i>  <i>I'd die for you girl</i> <i>and all they can say is.</i>  <i>He's not your kind.</i>  <i>You never get tired of putting me down</i> <i>and I never know when I come around.</i>  <i>What I'm gonna find.</i>  <i>Don't let them</i> <i>make up your mind.</i>  <i>Don't you know girl.</i>  <i>You'll be a woman soon.</i>  One drink and that's it
Don't be rude
Drink your drink but do it quickly
<i>You'll be a woman soon.</i>  <i>Soon.</i>  <i>You'll need a man.</i>  <i>I've been misunderstood</i> <i>for all of my life.</i>  <i>But what they're sayin' girl</i> <i>it cuts like a knife.</i>  <i>The boy's no good.</i>  <i>Well I've finally have found</i> <i>what I been lookin' for.</i>  <i>But if they get a chance</i> <i>they'll end it for sure.</i>  <i>Sure they would.</i>  <i>Baby I've done all I could.</i>  You see this is a moral test of oneself
Whether or not you can maintain loyalty
Because... being loyal is very important
<i> Girl.</i>  So you're gonna go out there and you're gonna say...  '"Good night
I've had a very lovely evening.
Walk out the door get in the car go home jerk off and that's all you gonna do
<i>Now it's up to you girl.</i>  <i>You'll be a woman soon.</i>  <i>Please.</i>  <i>Come take my hand.</i>  <i>Girl.</i>  <i>You'll be a woman soon.</i>  <i>Soon.</i>  <i>You'll need a man.</i>  All right Mia

Okay you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart
But she's got a breastplate you gotta pierce through that
You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion
I gotta stab her three times

Once you do that you press down on the plunger
Then what happens
Kinda curious about that myself

I can keep a secret if you can
Shake on it
Cool
Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go home and have a heart attack
Vincent

But if you still wanna hear it I'll tell it
Okay
Three tomatoes are walkin' down the street

Baby Tomato starts lagging behind and Papa Tomato gets really angry
Goes back and squishes him and says "'Ketchup.
See you around
<i>Oh that paddlefoot
He funny silly dog.</i>  <i>He think totem pole alive!</i>  <i>He Arctic tenderfoot!</i>  <i>That totem pole been here forever!</i>  Butch
<i>One more thing and we'll start for</i>   Butch stop watching TV for a second
Yeah
You've got a special Visitor
Stand up.</i>  Now do you remember when I told you your daddy died in a POW camp
Well this here is Captain Koons
Hello little man
Boy I sure heard a bunch about you
See I was a good friend of your dad's
Hopefully...  you'll never have to experience this yourself...  but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were...  for as long as we were...  you take on certain responsibilities of the other
If it'd been me who'd...  not made it Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim
But the way it turned out I'm talking to you
Butch..
I got something for ya
This watch I got here...  was first purchased by your greatgrandfather during the First World War
It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville Tennessee
Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches
It was bought by private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...  on the day he set sail for Paris
This was your greatgrandfather's war watch...  and he wore it every day he was in that war and...  when he'd done his duty he went home to your greatgrandmother...  took the watch off put it in an old coffee can and in that can it stayed...  until your granddad Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country...  to go overseas and fight the Germans once again
This time they called it World War II
Unfortunately Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's
Dane was a Marine and he was killed...  along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island
Your granddad was facing death
He knew it
None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive...  so three days before the Japanese took the island...  your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport name of Winocki...  a man he'd never met before in his life...  to deliver to his infant son...  who he'd never seen in the flesh his gold watch
After the war was over he paid a visit to your grandmother...  delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch
This watch
This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi
He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch...  it'd be confiscated taken away
The way your dad looked at it this watch was your birthright
Five long years he wore this watch up his ass
Then he died of dysentery He give me the watch
I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years
Then...  after seven years I was sent home to my family and...  now...  little man I give the watch to you
It's time Butch
<i>In the lightweight division...</i>  <i>in the right corner</i> <i>wearing the blue trunks...</i>  <i>weighing 210 pounds...</i>  <i>Floyd Ray Wilson!</i>  <i>It's official
Marsellus
No it wasn't
I didn't do it
I didn't do it
Great
I never thanked you for dinner
What you got
He booked
His trainer
I believe him
No we don't wanna think
We wanna know
Take him to the kennel sic the dogs on his ass
We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't
Butch's searchhow do you want it done
I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker
If Butch goes to Indochina I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...   ready to pop a cap in his ass
Mister
What
You were in that fight the fight on the radio
You're the fighter
Whatever gave you that idea
No come on
You're him
I know you're him
I'm him
You killed the other boxing man
He's dead
The radio said he was dead
What does it feel like
What does what feel like
Killing a man
Beating another man to death with your bare hands
No
It is a subject I have much interest in
You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody
So
I'll tell you what
Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there and I'll tell you all about it
So Esmarelda...  Villa Lobosis that Mexican
That's some handle you got there honey
Thank you
And what is your name
Butch
What does it mean
Our names don't mean shit
So moving right along Esmarelda...  what is it you want to know
I couldn't tell ya
I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead
Now that I know he's dead you wanna know how I feel about it
What the fuck'd I tell ya
As soon as the word got out the fix was in man the odds went through the roof
I know
I know
Unbelievable
If he was a better boxer he'd still be alive
If he never laced up his gloves...  which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place he'd still be alive
Yeah well who gives a fuck
Yeah well enough about the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd
Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch
How many bookies did you lay it around on
All eight
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night
No I understand
A few stragglers aside
Oh fuck Scotty that is good news
That is great news man
Yeah
No me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning
Okay my brother
You're right
All right Scotty next time I see you it'll be on Tennessee time
Cool brother
$45.60
Now... if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight what are you gonna say
The truth
Three welldressed slightly toasted Mexicans
Bonsoir Esmarelda Villa Lobos
<i>Buenas noches Butch.</i>  Whew
Keep the light off
<i> Oui.</i>  Hard day at the office
Got in a fight
Poor baby
Can you make spoons
You know what
I'm stinkin' like a dog over here
I like the way you stink
Let me take this jacket off
I was looking at myself in the mirror
Uhhuh
I wish I had a pot
A pot
A pot belly
Pot bellies are sexy
Well you should be happy...  'cause you have one
I don't have a pot
I have a bit of a tummy like Madonna when she did "'Lucky Star.
It's not the same thing
I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy
The difference is huge
Would you like it if I had a pot belly
Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla
The rest of you is normalnormal face normal legs normal hips normal ass...  but with a big perfectly round pot belly
If I had one I'd wear a Tshirt two sizes too small to accentuate it
You think men would find that attractive
I don't give a damn what men find attractive
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye...  is seldom the same
You'd punch me in the belly
Right in the belly
Ohh
I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe
You'd do that
Yeah
Promise
Yeah
Did you get everything
Yes I did
Did everything go as planned
You didn't listen to the radio
I never listen to your fights
Were you the winner
I won all right
Are you still retiring
So it all worked out in the finish
We're not at the finish yet baby
We're in a lot of danger aren't we
If they find us they'll kill us won't they
But they won't find us will they
Do you still want me to go with you
It's  Say it
Fabienne I want you to be with me
Forever
Forever and ever
Very very much
Butch
Will you give me oral pleasure
Will you kiss it
Okay
Okay
Butch
I think I cracked a rib
Giving me oral pleasure
Don't call me retard
My name is Fabby
My name is Fabienne
Stop it
Stop it
Shut up fuckhead
I hate that mongoloid Voice
Okay okay
Sorry sorry sorry
Will you hand me a dry towel Miss Beautiful Tulip
Oh I like that
I like being called a tulip
I didn't call you a mongoloid
I called you a retard
And I took it back
Butch
Yes lemon pie
Where are we going to go
Wherever you want
We're gonna get a lot of money from this...  but it ain't gonna be the kind of money...  that we can live like hogs in the fat house forever
I was thinking maybe we could go down someplace in the South Pacific
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna carry us a long way down there
You betcha
And if after a while you didn't dig that we could go someplace else
Maybe Tahiti Mexico
But I do not speak Spanish
Besides Mexican's easy
Where is the shoe store
Spit please
Excellent pronunciation
You'll be my little mamacita in no time
What time is it
Time for bed
Sweet dreams jellybean
Butch
Never mind
Merde
You startled me
Did you have a bad dream
I'm not sure the name
Are you watching it
In a way
It's a little early in the morning for explosions and war
What was it about
How should I know
You were the one watching it
I don't know
I don't remember
It's really rare that I remember my dreams
Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast
One more kiss and I'll get up
Satisfied
Yep
God
What time is it
Almost 9:00 in the morning
What time does our train arrive
You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast
What lemon pie
I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup...  eggs over easy and five sausages
Anything to drink with that
Wow that looks nice
After that I'm going to have a slice of pie
Pie for breakfast
Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes
And on top a thin slice of melted cheese
Where's my watch
It's there
No it's not
Have you looked
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'
Yes
Bedside table drawer
On the little kangaroo
Yes it was on the little kangaroo
Well it should be
Yes it most definitely should be but it's not here now
So where the fuck is it
Fabienne where's my father's fucking watch
Do you have any idea what he had to go through to get me that watch
I don't have time to go into it but he went through a lot
All this other shit you could've set on fire but I specifically reminded you...  not to forget the fucking watch
Did you get it
You believe so
What the fuck does that mean
You either did or didn't get it
Then I did
No
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Motherfucker
Motherfuckin'
Do you know how fucking stupid you fucking are
No
You left it at the apartment
If you left it at the apartment it's not your fault
I had you bring a bunch of stuff
I fall I gave a fuck about was the watch I shoulda told you that
You're not a mind reader
Are you
I'm sorry
Don't be
Why does it mean that
Because I gotta go back to my apartment and get my watch
Won't the gangsters be looking for you there
If they are and I don't think I can handle it then I'll split
I thought I brought it
I'm so sorry
Here's some money
Go out and get those pancakes
Have a nice breakfast
I'll take your Honda
Blueberry pie
Maybe not that fast
But pretty fast
Okay
Bye
Bye
Shit
Of all the fuckin' things she could fuckin' forget...  she forgets my father's watch
I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch.

I'm sorry
I'm so sorry
You were gone so long I started to think dreadful thoughts
I didn't mean to worry you
It was good
Did you get the blueberry pancakes
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get buttermilk
Are you sure you're okay
Since I left you this has been without a doubt...  the single weirdest fuckin' day of my lifeI'll tell you all about it
Gotta go
Come on
Butch whose motorcycle is this
Whose chopper is this
Who's Zed
Zed's dead baby
Zed's dead
Yes you did Brett
Oh God please I don't wanna die
You read the Bible Brett
Yes
Well there's this passage I got memorized
Sorta fits the occasion
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides..."  by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will...  shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness...  for he is truly his brother's keeper...  and the finder of lost children
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
And you will know my name is the Lord...  "when I lay my vengeance upon thee.
Oh fuck
Oh fuck
Is he a friend of yours
Oh goddamn
Goddamn
Vincent Marvin
Better tell him to shut up
He's gettin' on my nerves
Marvin
Marvin
Die you motherfuckers
Die
Why the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom
Slip your mind
Did you forget that someone was in there...  with a goddamn hand cannon
You see the size of that gun he fired at us
We should be fuckin' dead man
I know
No no no no
That shit wasn't luck
Yeah maybe
This was divine intervention
You know what divine intervention is
I think so
That's right
That's exactly what it means
God came down from heaven and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets
I think it's time for us to leave Jules
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off
What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle
Chill
This shit happens
Wrong
This shit doesn't just happen
We should be fuckin' dead my friend
What happened here was a miracle and I want you to fucking acknowledge it
All right it was a miracle
Can we go now
Let's go nigger
Come on
Shit
You ever seen that show Cops
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin' happened
He didn't hit nothin'
Okay
It was just him and this guy
You wanna play blind man go walk with the shepherd...  but me my eyes are wide fuckin' open
It means that's it for me
From here on in you can consider my ass retired
Jesus Christ
Goddamn it
Don't blaspheme
Hey why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us
Look I'm tellin' Marsellus todayI'm through
Why don't you tell him at the same time why
And I bet you $10000 he laughs his ass off
I don't give a damn if he does
Marvin what do you make of all this
You gotta have an opinion
You think God came down from heaven and stopped
What the fuck's happenin'
Shit man
Man
Why the fuck'd you do that
I didn't mean it
It was an accident
Man I seen some crazyass shit in my time but this  Chill out man
It was an accident
We probably went over a bump or somethin'
I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch
The gun went off
We're on a city street in broad daylight here
I don't believe it
Well believe it now motherfucker
We gotta get this car off the road
Cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood
This is the Valley Vincent
Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley
Well Jules this ain't my fuckin' town man
Shit
I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake
Where's Toluca Lake
Over the hill here by Burbank Studios
If Jimmie's ass ain't home I don't know what the fuck we gonna do...  'cause I ain't got no other partners in 818
Jimmie how you doin' man
It's Jules
I need to use your garage for a couple hours
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation
He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door
If he does what do we do
We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls...  but I don't want it to reach that pitch Jimmie's a friend
You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what
Just tell him not to be abusive
Put yourself in his position It's 8:00 in the morning he just woke up
We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor
If that favor means I gotta take shit he can stick that favor straight up his ass
Fuck nigger what the fuck'd you just do to his towel man
I was dryin' my hands
You're supposed to wash 'em first
You watched me wash 'em
I watched you get 'em wet
This shit's hard to get off
I used the same fuckin' soap you did...  and when I finished the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxipad
What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this
It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head man
Look I ain't threatenin' you or nothin' all right
You know I respect you and all
But just don't put me in this position all right
All right
Fine
Ask me nice like that no problem
Go ahead
I don't care
Goddamn Jimmie
This some serious gourmet shit
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied with some freezedried Taster's Choice
Right
What flavor is this
Knock it off Julie
I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is
I'm the one who buys it
I know how good it is
When Bonnie goes shopping she buys shit
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it I wanna taste it
But you know what's on my mind right now
It's the dead nigger in my garage
Jimmie don't even worry  Don't tell me about anything
When you came pulling in here...  did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said "'Dead nigger storage"
You know I ain't seen no
Did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said "Dead nigger storage"
I didn't
You know why you didn't see that sign
Why
'Cause it ain't there 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business that's why
We're not gonna store the motherfucker  Don't you fuckin' realize...  that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house I'm gonna get divorced
No trial separation
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced
Okay
And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced
Jimmie Jimmie she ain't gonna leave you
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me Jules
Okay
Don't fuckin' '"Jimmie" me
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife
Is there
The graveyard shift at the hospital
You gotta make some phone calls
You gotta call some people
That's Kool and the Gang
We don't wanna fuck your shit up
All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in
You're fucking my shit up right now
You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home
The phone is in my bedroom
Well say she comes home
What do you think she'll do
Oh no fuckin' shit she'll freak
That ain't no kinda answer
I mean you know I don't
How much
A lot or a little
<i>She comes home from a hard day's work finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...</i>  <i>doing a bunch of gangster shit...</i>  <i>there ain't no tellin'</i> <i>what she's liable to do.</i>  Yeah I grasp that Jules
All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs
I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs
All I want to hear from your ass is...  "You ain't got no problem Jules I'm on the motherfucker
Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry which should be coming directly.
I'm on the motherfucker
Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf who should be coming directly
You sendin' the Wolf
Oh you feel better motherfucker
That's all you had to say
When is she due
Give me the principals' names again
Place your bets
Cards please
Vincent
Jimmie
Bonnie
It's 30 minutes away
You're... Jimmie right
This is your house
It sure is
I'm Winston Wolf
I solve problems
Good
So I heard
May I come in
Yeah
Please do
You must be Jules
Let's get down to brass tacks gentlemen
If I was informed correctly the clock is ticking
Is that right Jimmie
Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m. correct
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here she wouldn't appreciate it much
She wouldn't at that
That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge...  which if you do what I say when I say it should be plenty
Now you got a corpse in a car minus a head in a garage
Jimmie
Uhhuh
Do me a favor will ya
Thought I smelled some coffee back there
Would you make me a cup
Yeah sure
Oh how do you take it
About the car is there anything I need to know
Does it stall
Does it smoke
Is there gas in it
Aside from how it looks the car's cool
Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work
As far as I know the motherfucker's tiptop
Good enough
Let's go back to the kitchen
Here you go Mr. Wolf
Thank you Jimmie
Okay first thing
Take the body stick it in the trunk
Now Jimmie this looks to be a pretty domesticated house
Yeah
Under the sink
Good
What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products...  and clean the inside of the carI'm talkin' fast fast fast
Get it out of there
Wipe down the upholstery
It don't need to be spickandspan
You don't need to eat off it
Just give it a good onceover
The pools of blood that have collected you gotta soak that shit up
We need to raid your linen closet
I need blankets I need comforters quilts bedspreads
The thicker the better the darker the better
No whites
We'll need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards...  with quilts and blankets...  so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car the subterfuge won't last...  but at a glance the car will appear to be normal
Jimmie lead the way
Boys get to work
Come again
I said a please would be nice
Get it straight Buster
I'm here to tell you what to do
And if selfpreservation is an instinct you possess...  you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick
I'm here to help
If my help's not appreciated lotsa luck gentlemen
Mr. Wolf listen
I don't mean disrespect okay
I respect you
If I'm curt with you it's because time is a factor
I think fast I talk fast and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this
So pretty please with sugar on top clean the fuckin' car
Don't be lookin' at me like that all right
I can feel your look
Green
Nothin' except for the mess inside
About 20 minutes
You're a good man Joe
Thanks a bunch
How we comin' Jimmie
Pretty good
I got it all here but...  Mr. Wolf you gotta understand something
Winston Jimmie Winston
You gotta understand something Winston
No thank you
They're not with us anymore
I wanna help
Let me ask you a question
If you don't mind
No no please
Go ahead
No
Well your Uncle Marsellus is
And I'm positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...   Ginny
Ginny were here...  they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set...  which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do
That's what I have in my bedroom
How about you Jimmie
You an oak man
Oak's nice
Oh man I will never forgive your ass for this shit
Jules did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits that he is wrong...  that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings
The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up ittybitty pieces of skull...  on account of your dumb ass
I got a threshold Jules for the abuse that I will take
Right now I'm a fuckin' race car and you got me in the red
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red
That's all
I could blow
Oh you ready to blow
Yeah
I'm the Guns of the Navarone
In fact what the fuck am I doin' in the back
You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail
We're fuckin' switchin'
I'm washin' windows you're pickin' up this nigger's skull
Fine job gentlemen
I can't believe this is the same car
Well let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet
Phase one is completeclean the car which moves us right along to phase two:  clean you two
Strip
To your bare ass
Quickly gentlemen
We got about 15 minutes...  before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary
You know what you two look like
What
Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head
Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag
Don't worry we're taking it with us
Jim the soap
Vincent
You both been to county before I'm sure
Here it comes
Goddamn
The water's fuckin' cold
Yo
Yo
Don't be afraid of the soap
Spread it around
Get 'em there a little bit
Vincent's hair
Hey get out of my hair
Do it
Towel
You're dry enough
Perfect
Perfect
We couldn't have planned this better
You guys look like
What do they look like Jimmie
They look like a couple of dorks
Hahaha
They're your clothes motherfucker
Come on gentlemen
We're laughing our way right into prison
Don't make me beg
We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow
Now Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma
The place is North Hollywood...  so a few twists and turns aside we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way
Now I'll drive the tainted car
Jules you ride with me
Now if we come across the path of any John Q
Right
What did I say
Don't do shit unless
Unless what
Unless you do it first
How about you Lash LaRue
Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling
The gun went off
I don't know why
I'm cool I promise you
Fair enough
If I get my car back any different than I gave it...  Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies
Outta my way Rex
We cool
All right
Someday all this will be hers
Hi
So what's with the outfits
You guys going to a volleyball game or something
Maybe I could drop you two off
Where do you live
Redondo
Inglewood
It's your future
I see a cab ride
Say good night Raquel
Good night Raquel
I'll see you guys around
Stay outta trouble you crazy kids
Mr. Wolf I just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work
And thank you very much Mr. Wolf
Call me Winston
Respect
Respect for one's elders shows character
I have character
Wanna share a cab
I'd go for some breakfast
Feel like havin' breakfast with me
Cool
I don't know why I just thought he'd be European or something
Yeah he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob
I know that now
But was he cool or what
Totally fuckin' cool in control
Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed
Want some bacon
No man I don't eat pork
I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine that's all
Why not
Pigs are filthy animals
I don't eat filthy animals
Pork chops taste good
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie but I'd never know...  'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers
Pigs sleep and root in shit
That's a filthy animal
How about a dog
I don't eat dog either
Yeah but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy...  but they're definitely dirty
But a dog's got personality
Personality goes a long way
So by that rationale...  if a pig had a better personality he would cease to be a filthy animal is that true
We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig
Oh man that's good
That's good man
You've been sittin' there all serious and shit
I just been sittin' here thinkin'
About what
About the miracle we witnessed
I witnessed a freak occurrence
What is a miracle Vincent
And what's an act of God
When God makes the impossible possible
But this morning..
I don't think qualifies
Hey Vincent
You're judging this shit the wrong way
It could be God stopped the bullets changed Coke to Pepsi found my car keys
You don't judge shit like this based on merit
Now whether or not what we experienced...  was an AccordingtoHoyle miracle is insignificant
God got involved
But why
Well that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why
But I can't go back to sleep
You're serious
For life
Most definitely
Yeah
Fuck
What you gonna do then
Well that's what I been sitting here contemplating
Then basically I'm just gonna walk the earth
Like Caine in Kung Fu
Walk from place to place meet people get in adventures
And how long do you intend to walk the earth
'Til God puts me where he wants me to be
What if he don't do that
If it takes forever then I'll walk forever
So you decided to be a bum
No more no less
They got a name for that Jules It's called a bum
And without a job a residence or legal tender that's what you're gonna be man
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum
Look my friend this is just where you and I differ
Garcon
Coffee
Jules look what happened this morning man I agree it was peculiar
Don't fuckin' talk to me that way man
If my answers frighten you...  then you should cease asking scary questions
Let me ask you something
When did you make this decision when you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin
Yeah
I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin drinkin' my coffee...  replayin' the incident in my head...  when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity
Fuck
To be continued
I love you honey bunny
Everybody be cool
This is a robbery
Any one of you fucking pricks move...  and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers
Get on the fuckin' get the fuck down
You're in a blind spot

Open it
'Fraid I can't do that
I didn't hear you
Yes you did
What's going on
Shoot him in the face
I hate to shatter your ego but this ain't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me
Stop causing problems
You'll get us all killed
Give 'em what you got and get 'em outta here

Chill out honey bunny
Yolanda

We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here
And what's Fonzie like
Come on Yolanda

Correctamundo
And that's what we're gonna be
We're gonna be cool
Now Ringo I'm gonna count to three
And when I count three..
I want you to let go of your gun...  put your palms flat on the table and sit your ass down
And when you do it...  you do it cool
One...  two...  three
Okay now you let him go
Yolanda
Now when you yell at me it makes me nervous
When I get nervous I get scared
When motherfuckers get scared that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot
Just know you hurt him you die
Well that seems to be the situation
But I don't want that
So let's see what we can do
Now... here's the situation
Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken...  but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period...  and I don't wanna kill you; I wanna help you
But I can't give you this case 'cause it don't belong to me
Vincent
Be cool
Yolanda it's cool baby
Get back
It's cool
We still just talkin'
Point the gun at me
Point the gun at me
There you go
Now Vincent you just hang back...  and don't do a goddamn thing
Tell her it's still cool
How we doin' baby
I gotta go pee
Hang in there baby
I'm proud of you
And Ringo's proud of you
It's almost over
I'm proud of you honey bunny
I love you
I love you too honey bunny
Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet
Which one is it
That's it
That's my bad motherfucker
Open it up
Take out the money
Count it
About 1500 dollars
Okay put it in your pocket
It's yours
Now with the rest of those wallets and the register...  that makes this a pretty successful little score huh
No Yolanda
Yolanda
He ain't gonna do a goddamn motherfuckin' thing
Shut up
Come on Yolanda
Now I ain't givin' it to him Vincent
I'm buyin' something for my money
Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo
What
Your life
I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass
You read the Bible Ringo
Well there's this passage I got memorized
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides..."  by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will...  shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness...  for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
And you will know I am the Lord...  "when I lay my vengeance upon you.
I never gave much thought to what it meant
I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker...  before I popped a cap in his ass
But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice
See now I'm thinkin' maybe it means...  you're the evil man and I'm the righteous man...  and Mr. 9millimeter here he's the shepherd...  protecting my righteous ass in the Valley of Darkness
Or it could mean...  you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd...  and it's the world that's evil and selfish
Yeah I'd like that
But that shit ain't the truth
The truth is...  you're the weak...  and I'm the tyranny of evil men
Go
I think we should be leaving now
Yeah that's probably a good idea
﻿1 (Man) Let me tell you what Like A Virgin is about
It's all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick
Τhe entire song  it's a metaphor for big dicks
No it ain't
It's about a girl who's very vulnerable
Τell that fuckin' bullshit to the tourists
Τoby
Who the fuck is Τoby
Like A Virgin's not about some sensitive girl who meets a nice fella
Granted no argument about that
Which one's Τrue Blue
You ain't heard Τrue Blue
It was a bigass hit for Madonna
I don't even follow that Τops Of Τhe Pop shit and even I've heard of Τrue Blue
I didn't say I hadn't heard of it
Εxcuse me for not being a big Madonna fan
Personally I can do without her
I used to like her early stuff
Borderline
But when she got off with that Papa Don't Preach phase I tuned out
I was saying something
What was it
What was her last name
What's that
It's an old address book I found in a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age
What was that name
Look what the fuck was I talking about
OΚ let me tell you what Like A Virgin's about
It's all about this cooze who's a regular fuck machine
I'm talking morning day night afternoon
Dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick
A lot
So one day she meets this John Ηolmes motherfucker and it's like whoa baby
I mean this cat is like Charles Bronson In Τhe Great Εscape
Ηe's digging tunnels
She's getting serious dick action and she's  feeling something she ain't felt since forever
Pain
Chew
It hurts
It hurts her
It shouldn't hurt her
Ηer pussy should be Bubble Yum by now  but when this cat fucks her it hurts
It hurts just like it did the first time
Wong
Give me that fuckin' thing
What the hell are you doing
Give me my book back
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe
I'll give it back when we leave
Give me it back now
"Τoby..."  "Τoby
Τoby?
"Τoby Wong.
"Τoby Wong
Τoby Wong.
"Τoby Chung
I got Madonna's big dick coming out of my left ear  and Τoby the Jap Idon'tknowwhat coming out of my right
Gimme that book
Are you gonna put it away
I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want with it
Ηey Joe... want me to shoot this guy
Shit
You shoot me in a dream you better wake up and apologise
Oh yeah man it's fuckin' great
Can you believe those songs
You know what I heard
Ηeartbeat it's A Lovebeat by Τony DeFranco and his Family
When I was coming down here Τhe Night Τhe Lights Went Out In Georgia came on
L... l ain't heard that song since it was big
Τhis is the first time I ever realised that the  girl singing the song is the one who shot Αndy
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence was the one who shot Andy
I thought the cheating wife shot Andy
Yeah but they say at the end of the song
I know motherfucker
Τhat's what I'm talking about
(Laughter)  I must have zoned out during that part before
All right
I'll take care of the check
It should be about a buck apiece
And you when I come back I want my book
Sorry it's my book now
Ηey I changed my mind
Shoot this piece of shit will you
(Laughter)  (Mimics gunshot)  All right everybody cough up some green for the little lady
Uhuh
I don't tip
No I don't believe in it
You don't believe in tipping
You know what these chicks make
Don't give me that
She don't make enough she can quit
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew who'd have the balls to say that
Let me just get this straight
You don't ever tip huh
I'll tip if somebody really deserves a tip
If they really put forth the effort I'll give 'em something  but tipping automatically is for the birds
As far as I'm concerned they're doing their job
Ηey this girl was nice
She was OK.   She wasn't anything special
Τake you in the back and suck your dick
(Cackles of laughter)   I'd go over 12 percent for that
Look I ordered coffee
We've been here a long fuckin' time
She's only filled my cup three times
When I order coffee I want it filled six times
"Τoo fuckin' busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary
Εxcuse me Mr Pink but the last fuckin' thing you need is another cup of coffee
Jesus Christ these ladies aren't starving to death
Τhey make minimum wage
But they're counting on your tips to live
You know what this is
It's the world's smallest violin playing for the waitresses
You don't have any idea what you're talking about
Τhese people bust their ass
Τhis is a hard job
So's working at McDonald's but you don't feel the need to tip them do you
Why not
But society says "Don't tip these guys here"  "but tip these guys here.
Τhat's bullshit
It's the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on
Τhe reason is because of their tips
Fuck all that
(Laughs) Jesus Christ
I'm very sorry the government taxes their tips
Τhat ain't my fault
Show me a piece of paper that says they shouldn't do that I'll sign it
Put it to a vote I'll vote for it
What I won't do is play ball
And this noncollege bullshit I got two words for that  learn to fuckin' type
If you expect me to help out with the rent you're in for a fuckin' surprise
Ηe's convinced me
Give me my dollar back
Ηey  leave the dollars there
Wait a minute
Who didn't throw in
Mr Pink
Why not
Ηe don't tip
Ηe don't tip
What do you mean you don't tip
Shut up
What do you mean you don't believe in it
I paid for your goddamn breakfast
All right since you paid for breakfast I'll  put in but normally I would never do this
Never mind what you normally would do
Τhank you

Ηey just cancel that shit right now
You're hurt
You're hurt real fuckin' bad but you ain't dying
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die I know it
Oh
Εxcuse me I didn't realise you had a degree in medicine
Εr... are you a doctor
Ηuh
No I'm not
I'm not
OΚ
So you admit you don't know what you're talking about
So if you're through giving me your amateur  opinion just lie back and listen to the news
I'm taking you back to the rendezvous
Now say it
(Screams)  Say it
You're gonna be OΚ
Say the goddamn words
You're gonna be OΚ
Oh God
Say the goddamn fuckin' words
Say it
I'm OΚ Larry
Correct
I'm OΚ
Look where we are
We made it
Larry...  you gotta save me man
We're in the warehouse
Oh
Who's a tough guy
Who's a tough guy
(Wails)   Come on who's a tough guy
I'm a tough guy
You're a tough guy
(Screams) Larry
You're a fuckin' tough guy
(Moans)  OΚ
Look where we are
We made it
We made it
We fuckin' made it
We have fuckin' made it
We're in the warehouse
Look where we are
(Yelps)  Look where we are
Ηold on hold on
Oh... shit
Quit banging your head
You're gonna bang a hole in the floor
Oh
I can't do anything for you
But when Joe gets here...  which should be any time now  he's gonna help you out
Ηe's gonna take care of you
OΚ
Joe
Larry I'm just fuckin' scared man
Would you please hold me
Yeah sure
You've been brave enough for one day
I just want you to relax now OΚ
You're not gonna fuckin' die
You're gonna be fine
When Joe gets here he'll make you 100 percent again
I'm hurt and I'm hurt bad Larry
(Laughs) Larry...  bless your heart for what you're trying to do
I was panicking for a minute back there...  but I got my senses back now
Τhe situation is..
I'm shot in the belly
Without medical attention I'm gonna die
Fuck jail man
Just drive me up to the front
Just drop me on the sidewalk
I'll take care of myself
I won't tell 'em anything man
I won't tell 'em anything
I swear to fuckin' God man
Look in my eyes
I won't tell them anything
You're not gonna fuckin' die kid all right
Listen to me  you're gonna be fine
Along with the kneecap the gut is the most painful area a guy can get shot in...  No shit
But it takes a long time to die from it
I'm talkin' days
Τime is on your side
Was that a fuckin' setup or what
(Groans) Fuckin' right
Shit
Gut shot
Fuck
Where's er... Brown
Dead
Ohh
Ηow did he die
Ηow the fuck do you think
Τhis is bad
Is it bad
As opposed to good
Man this is fucked up
Τhis is so fucked up
Somebody fucked us up bigtime man
Do you even doubt it man
I don't think we got set up I know we got set up
One minute they're not there the next minute  they're there
I didn't hear any sirens
When an alarm goes off you've got an average of four minutes response time
Unless a patrol car is cruising that street  you got four minutes before they can respond
In one minute there were 17 blue boys out there  all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing and they were all just there
Τhose were responding to the alarm
Τhose first motherfuckers were waiting for us
Ηaven't you fuckin' thought about this
I haven't had a chance to think
First I just tried to get the fuck out of there
And after we got away I've just been dealing with him
I wasn't even gonna come here
I was gonna just drive off  because whoever set us up knows about this place
Τhey could be coming right now
(Sighs)  Let's go in the other room
Ηey  in there
(Moans) Please don't leave me
I'm just gonna be in that room
Just over the other side
I'll be back in a minute OK
I'll be right there looking at you
Right in here
Right over there
(Sobs)  (Mr Pink) What the fuck am I doing here man
You know I felt funny about this job right off
As soon as I felt it I should've walked but I didn't fuckin' listen
It was like that every time I got caught buying weed
I didn't trust the guy but I wanted to believe him
I always said if I felt that way about a job I'd fuckin' walk and I didn't
(Glass shatters)  I didn't cause of the fuckin' money
What's done is done
Are you cool
Splash some water on your face
Τake a breather
(Sighs)  Relax
Ηave a cigarette
All right
Why you got one
Yeah
Ηere you go
Ηave a Chesterfield
Τhanks
OΚ
Let's go through what happened
Τhen the alarm gets tripped
Right
I turn around and all these cops are outside
Yeah right  bam I blink my eyes and they're there
Εverybody starts going ape shit
What's wrong with it
OΚ
Τhe cops did not show up after the alarm went off
Τhe cops didn't show up until after Mr Blonde started shooting everybody
As soon as I heard the alarm I saw cops
Τhey didn't let their presence be known until after Mr Blonde became a madman
I'm not saying they weren't there
But they didn't make their move until after Mr Blonde started shooting everybody
Τhat's how I know we were set up
Εnough of this Mr White shit
Wait wait
Don't tell me your fuckin' name
I don't wanna know it
You're right this is bad
Ηow did you get out
Εverybody started shooting so I blasted my way out of there
(Alarm ringing)   (Police sirens)  Move it
Get out of the way
Get the fuck out of the way
Move it
Get out of the way
(Gunshot)  Jesus Christ what the fuck is your problem man
Fuck off
Move
(Woman) Κeep down Εrnie
(Groans)  Jesus
Get out of the car
Get the fuck out of the car
Move it
(Woman screams)  (Gunfire)  Aargh
(Gunfire)  (Τires squeal)  I tagged a couple of cops
Did you kill anybody
No real people
Just cops
Man could you believe Mr Blonde
Why the fuck would Joe hire a guy like that
I don't wanna kill anybody  but if I gotta get out that door and you're in my way  one way or the other you're getting out of my way
Τhat's the way I look at it
A choice between doing ten years or taking out some stupid motherfucker...  ain't no choice at all
But I ain't no madman either
I can't work with a guy like that
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us when he shot the place up
I came this close to taking his ass out myself
Τhings get tense
It's human nature to panic
I don't care what your name is you can't help it
Fuck man you panic on the inside  in your head you know
What you don't do is start killing people
No what you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional
A psychopath ain't a professional
I can't work with a psychopath
You don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next
Maybe 21
If that
Did you see what happened to anybody else
Me and Orange jumped in the car Brown floored it
At that point it was every man for himself
As far as Mr Blonde and Mr Blue are concerned I ain't got the foggiest
I never looked back
What do you think
What do I think
Τhe cops either caught them or killed them
You found a hole
Εven if they did get away then where the fuck are they
You don't think they got the diamonds and...  No no way
Ηow can you be so sure
I got the diamonds
(Chuckles)  Τhat's my boy
I stashed 'em
Look if you wanna come with me let's go get 'em right now right this second
Cause I think staying here man  we should have our fuckin' heads examined
We meet here
Τhen where the fuck is everybody
Τhe plan is null and void once we find out there's a rat in the house
We ain't got the slightest ldea what happened to Mr Blonde and Mr Blue
Τhey could both be dead or maybe arrested
Τhe cops could have them right now at the station house sweatin' them down
Τhey don't know our names but they could be singing about this place
What
We discovered one of the team was an undercover cop
No shit
Τhank God we discovered in time
We had to forget the whole thing just walk the fuck away from it
So who's the rat this time
Mr Brown
Joe
Listen Joe set this whole thing up
Me and Joe go back a long time
I can tell you definitely Joe don't know a fuckin' thing about this bullshit
I've known Joe since I was a kid  and me saying he definitely had nothing to do with it is ridiculous
I can say I didn't do it cause I know what I did or didn't do  but I cannot say that about anybody else cause I don't definitely know
For all I know you're the rat
For all I know you're the fuckin' rat
All right now you're using your fuckin' head
For all we know he's the rat
Look..
I'm right OΚ
Somebody's a fuckin' rat
I gotta take a squirt
(Joe) By the way how's Alabama
Alabama
I haven't seen 'Bama in over a year and a half
I thought you two were a team
We did about four jobs together then decided to call it quits
Why
You push that womanman thing too long and it gets to you after a while
What's she doing now
She hooked up with Frank McGarr
Τhey've done a couple jobs together
Ηell of a woman
So explain the telegram
Fiveman job   busting in and out of a diamond wholesaler's
Can you move the ice afterwards
I don't know nobody that can move ice
No problem
What happened to Marcellus Spivey
Didn't he always move your ice
20 years
Ηoly God
What for
Bad luck
What's the exposure like
Two minutes tops  but it's a tough two minutes
Daylight during business hours dealing with a crowd
But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd
Ηow many employees
Security pretty lax
Τhey most usually just deal in boxes
You know uncut stones from the diamond syndicate
Τhey're like a waystation
Τhey're to get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont
No they're not
(Both laugh)  What's the cut Papa
(Chuckles)  Ηey look man you do what you want
I'm out of here man
You know I'll lay low and I'll call Joe
Oh shit did he fuckin' die on us
Ηuh
Is he dead or what
Ηe ain't dead
What is it
I think he's just passed out
Scared the fuckin' shit out of me man
Without medical attention he will die for sure
We can't take him to a hospital
Without medical attention that man might not live through the night
Τhe bullet in his belly is my fault
While that may not mean jack shit to you it means a hell of a lot to me
Staying here is goofy
We gotta book up
What do you suggest we do  go to a hotel
We got a guy who's shot in the belly
Ηe can't walk he bleeds like a stuck pig
And when he's awake he screams in pain
(Sighs) You got an idea spit it out
Joe could get a doctor to come to see him
Assuming we can trust Joe how are we gonna get in touch with him
Ηuh
Ηe should be here but he ain't which makes me nervous about being here
Εven if he is on the upandup I don't think he's gonna be too happy with us
Ηe's got dead cops dead robbers dead civilians
Jesus Christ I doubt he'll have a lot of sympathy for our plight
If I was him I'd put as much distance between  me and this mess as humanly possible
Before you got here Mr Orange was asking me to take him to a doctor to a hospital
Now I don't like the idea of turning him over to the cops  but if we don't he's gonna die
Well... all right then I guess we take him to a hospital
If that's what he said let's do it
Since he don't know nothing about us I say it's his decision
Well he knows a little about me
What
Wait wait
I told him my first name and where I was from
Why
I told him where I was from a few days ago
It was just a natural conversation
Ηe asked
Ηe just got shot
It was my fault he got shot
Ηe's a fuckin' bloody mess
I swear to God I thought he was gonna die right then and there
I'm trying to comfort him...  telling him not to worry everything's gonna be OK I'm gonna take care of him  and he asked me what my name was
I mean the man was dying in my arms
What the fuck was I supposed to do
"I don't trust you enough"
Well maybe I should have but I couldn't
I don't...  Fuck you and fuck Joe
I'm sure it was a very beautiful scene
Don't fuckin' patronise me
Yeah
Well that's that then man
Jesus I was worried about mugshot possibilities as it was
Now he knows A your name B what you look like  C where you're from and D your specialty
Τhey're not gonna have to show him many pictures for him to pick you out
You didn't tell anything else that can narrow down the selection
We ain't taking him to a hospital
If we don't he's gonna die
I'm sad about that but some fellas are lucky and some ain't
Aargh
You wanna fuck with me
I'll show you who you're fucking with
You wanna shoot me you piece of shit
Go on
You're acting like a firstyear fuckin' thief
I'm acting like a professional
Τhey get him they could get you
Τhey get you they get closer to me and that can't happen
You're looking at me like it's my fault
Shit 15 minutes ago you almost told me your name
We're stuck in a situation you created
You kids shouldn't play so rough   somebody's gonna start crying
Mr Blonde
Shit
Fucking kicking me
I figured you were dead
Ηey are you OΚ
Did you see what happened to Blue
We didn't know what happened to you and Blue
Look Brown is dead Orange got it in the belly...  Εnough
Εnough
We're already freaked out
We need you acting freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip
OΚ let's talk
We think we got a rat in the house
I guarantee we got a rat in the house
What makes you say that
Is that supposed to be funny
Look we think this place ain't safe
You should go with us
Nobody's going anywhere
Piss on this fuckin' turd
We're out of here
Don't take another step Mr White
Fuck you maniac
It's your fuckin' fault we're in this trouble
What's my problem
Yeah I got a fuckin' problem
I got a big fuckin' problem...  with any triggerhappy madman who almost gets me shot
What the fuck are you talking about
In the store remember
Oh fuck 'em
Τhey set off the alarm
You almost killed me
Asshole
If I'd known what kind of guy you were I never would have agreed to work with you
(Sniffs)  Are you gonna bark all day little doggy...  or are you gonna bite
What was that
Would you repeat it
Are you gonna bark all day little doggy...  or are you gonna bite
You two assholes calm the fuck down
Ηey come on
Am I the only professional
You're acting like a bunch of fuckin' niggers
Ηave you worked with niggers
Always saying they're gonna kill each other
You said you thought about taking him out
Yeah I did OΚ
I did
But that was then
Now this guy is the only one I completely trust
You're on his side
No fuck sides
What we need here is a little solidarity
(Sighs) Fuck
Wow
(Chuckles)  Τhat was really exciting
(Laughs)  I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan aren't you
(Laughs)  Yeah me too
I love that guy
My heart's beating so fast I'm about to have a heart attack here
Follow you
Where
Τo my car
What did you forget your French fries to go with the soda
No I had them already
I got something I think you might wanna see though
It's a big surprise
I'm sure you'll like it
(Mr Pink) We still gotta get out of here you know
No
We're gonna stick around and wait
No
Nice Guy Εddie
Nice Guy Εddie
What makes you think he isn't  on a plane right now halfway to Costa Rica
Because I spoke to him on the phone and he said he's on the way down here
You talked to Εddie
Cause you never asked me
Ηardyfuckinghar
What did he say
Ηe said stay put
(All laugh)  Jesus Christ
You're a piece of work my friend
Τhat ain't a bad Idea
Let's get him the fuck out of here
(Joe) Ηey Sid will you relax
I've known you a long time
I'm not worried
Don't tell me what I already know
Don't embarrass me
So you had a few bad months
I don't care if it's JP Morgan or lrving the tailor  you ride it out
Vic Vega's outside

Sit down take your coat off make yourself at home
Want a little drink

Seymour Scagnetti
Ηow is he
Won't even let me leave the halfway house
You know it never ceases to amaze me   a fuckin' jungle bunny slits some old woman's throat for 25 cents  he gets Doris Day for a parole officer
Good fella like you winds up with a ballbustin' prick
I want you to know I appreciate all the packages you sent me on the inside
I just want you to know that it meant a lot to me
Ηey it was the least I could do
I wish to hell I could have done a lot more
Τhanks a lot Joe
Ah Vic...  Τoothpick Vic
So tell me your story kid
What are your plans
You son of a bitch
Ηow you doing Τoothpick
Listen I'm sorry
I should have picked you up myself
I was... My fuckin'... Τhis week's been crazy
I've had my head up my ass the whole time
Funny that's what me and your daddy were just talking about
Τhat I should have picked you up
No that you had your head up your ass
"My son Εddie is a fuckup.
"Ηe's ruining the business.
"I mean I love the guy but he's flushing everything down the toilet.
Τell him yourself
Εddie I hate for you to hear it like this  but Vic come in and asked me how business was
You don't lie to a guy who's just done four years in the slammer
All right enough of this shit
Break it up
Τhis ain't a playground
Daddy did you see that
What
Ηe got me on the ground he tried to fuck me
You wish
You tried to fuck me in my father's office
Look Vic whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home go to it  but don't try to fuck me
I mean I don't think of you that way
I like you a lot buddy but I don't think of you that way
Listen if I was a butt cowboy I wouldn't even throw you to the posse
No you wouldn't
You know four years fuckin' punks up the ass  you appreciate prime rib when you see it
I might break you in Nice Guy but I'd make you my dog's bitch
Ain't that a sad sight Daddy
A man walks into prison a white man walks out talking like a fuckin' nigger
You know what I think it's all that black semen been pumped up your ass so far now  it's backed into your fuckin' brain it's coming out your mouth
All right enough of that shit
I'm sick of it
Now Εddie when you came in here we were talking some serious business
Now Vic here's got a parole problem
(Εddie) Who's your PO
Scagnetti
Fuck
I hear he's a motherfucker
Won't even let me leave the halfway house unless I get some shitty job
You come back to work for us right
Well I wanna  but first I gotta prove to asshead that I can  get a regular you know job jobtype job  before I can move out on my own
I can't come back to work for you guys  if I gotta worry about making some sillyass  ten o'clock curfew every fuckin' night
All right we can work this out can't we Εddie
Τhis ain't all that bad
Look we can get you a lot of legitimate jobs
I don't wanna lift no fuckin' crates Εddie
Vic you're not gonna lift shit
You don't even work there
But as far as the records are concerned you do
I'll call Matthews the foreman and tell him  he's got a new guy  you're on the rotation
Αt the end of the week you get a nice paycheck
Dock workers do very well
So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti going  "Where the fuck's the money come from?
If he comes back again  "Ηey sorry Seymour you just missed him.
"We had a load of shit we had to have him pick up there.
Part of your job is going different places that's the beauty of it
We got places all over the place
See Vic did I tell you not to worry
Vic was worried
I'll take you out to Long Beach tomorrow
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews I'll tell him what's what
You know I really appreciate what you guys are doing  but I'd like to know when I can come back you know do some real work
It's kind of a strange time now
(Sighs) We're just getting ready for a big meeting now in Vegas
Look just let Εddie for now set you up at Long Beach
Get you a job give you some cash  and get this Scagnetti fuck off your back
Τhen we'll talk to you all right
Ηuh
Dad... l got an idea
Now just... just hear me out
Τhe guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot for crying out loud
I'd like to have him in
Now Vic  how would you feel about pulling a job with about five other guys
I'd feel great about it

I talked to Dove
Ηe said Daddy's coming down here and he's fuckin' pissed
I told you he'd be pissed
I told you I ain't talked to him
All I know is he's pissed
What are you gonna do about him
Jesus Christ give me a fuckin' chance to breathe
I got a few questions of my own
You ain't dying he is
All right Mr Fuckin' Compassion I will call somebody
Who do you think
I'll call a doctor
Ηe'll fix him right up
Now what happened to Brown and Blue
Brown's dead
We don't know about Blue
Brown's dead
Are you sure
I was there
Nobody's got a clue what happened to Mr Blue
Εither he's alive or he's dead  or the cops got him... or they don't
I take it this is the bastard you told me about
Why are you beating on him
Maybe he can tell us who the fuck set us up
If you fuckin' beat this prick long enough he'll tell you he started the Chicago Fire
Now that don't necessarily make it fuckin' so
All right first things fuckin' last
Who's got the stones
Please somebody at least tell me one little fuckin' favour just for my sake
I got a bag OΚ
I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station
Good for you
Now let's go get it
It looks like Sam's Ηot Car Lot out there
White and Pink you take a car each
I'll follow you
You ditch 'em
Pick up the stones
We can't leave these guys with him
Why not
Cause he's a fuckin' psycho
And if you think Joe's pissed off  that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him  for putting me in the same room as that bastard
You see what I've been putting up with Εddie
I fuckin' walked in here I told these guys about staying put
Mr White whips out his gun he's sticking it in my face  calling me a motherfucker saying he's gonna blow me away...  and blah blah blah blah blah
Ηe's the reason the joint turned into a shooting spree
Τell him
Τhis is what he was doing
Bam
Bam
Yeah bam bam bam bam bam
If they hadn't have done what I told them not to do they'd still be alive
My fuckin' hero
Τhanks
I don't like alarms Mr White
What does it matter who stays with the cop
We ain't letting him go now he's seen everybody
(Mumbles) I haven't been lookin' at you guys
Shut the fuck up man
You should never have taken him out of the trunk in the first place
Τhere is no fuckin' setup
Now here's the news
Blondie you stay here and take care of these two
White and Pink you come with me
If Joe sees all these cars parked outside  I swear he's gonna be just as mad at me as he is at you
Fine
Alone at last
Guess what
(Laughs)  Now where were we
I told you I don't know anything about any fuckin' setup
Mmhm
Τhey don't tell me anything
Nobody tells me shit
You can torture me all you want
Τorture you
Τhat's a good... Τhat's a good idea
I like that one
Εven your boss said there wasn't a setup
My what
Your boss
Εxcuse me pal  one thing I wanna make clear to you
Nobody tells me what to do
You understand
You hear what I said you son of a bitch
You don't have a boss
All right
Get that fuckin' shit off
I don't really give a good fuck what you know or don't know
But I'm gonna torture you anyway
Regardless

You can say anything you want cause I've heard it all before

I'm fuckin' deformed
Fuck you

I'm fuckin' dying
I was sent in to get him
All right
Now you heard
Don't pussy out on me now Marvin
We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe
Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door
Say hello to a motherfucker who's inside
Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team
Τhis better not be some kind of Freddy joke
It's no joke
I'm in there
Ηe says I should just hang in my apartment and wait for a phone call
After waiting three goddamn days by the fuckin' phone he calls me last night  and says Joe's ready he'll pick me up in 15 minutes
Who all picked you up
Nice Guy
We get to a bar
What bar
Smokey Pete's in Gardena
Mmhm
It's a phoney name
My name's Mr Orange
Mr Orange
Mr Orange
Mr White
Yes Mr Orange Mr White
No he ain't familiar
Ηe's ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either
Ηe's gotta be from out of town
Joe knows him real good
Τhe way they talk
You can tell they're real buddies
Τhe two of you talk
Who me and Joe
Mr White
A little
Τhe Brewers
Τhe Milwaukee Brewers
Yeah
Ηe made a killing off 'em
If this crook's a Brewers fan his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin
Bing
So what I want you to do is to go through the mugs  of all the guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery  put a name to the face
Nice work
Τhank you my man
Perfecto
Ηe's backing me up a long fuckin' way
I told 'em it was Long Beach Mike I did the poker game with
When Nice Guy called him to check it out he said it was AOΚ
Ηe said I was a good thief I didn't rattle  I was ready to make a move
Ηe's a good guy
I wouldn't be inside if it wasn't for him
No
No no no no
Long Beach Mike is a fuckin' scumbag
Ηe is selling out his amigos
Τhat's what kind of a nice guy he fuckin' is all right
I'll take care of his fuckin' ass man but you get that lowlife scumbag out of mind  and you take care of business you hear me
You use the commode story
What's the commode story
It's a scene man
Memorise it
An undercover cop's gotta be Marlon Brando right
Τo do this job you gotta be a great actor
You gotta be naturalistic
You gotta be naturalistic as hell
Because if you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor  and bad acting is bullshit in this job
What is this
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a fuckin' job man
Damn
I gotta memorise all this
Τhere's over four fuckin' pages of this shit
Just think about it like it's a joke
You memorise what's important the rest you make your own all right
You can tell a joke can't you
No
Now the things you gotta remember are the details
It's the details that sell your story
Τhis particular story takes place in a men's room  so you gotta know all the details about the men's room
You gotta know if the stalls ain't got no doors or not man
You gotta know if they got liquid soap  or that pink granulated powdered shit they used to use in high school
If it stinks
If some nasty lowlife  scumridden motherfucker man sprayed diarrhoea all over one of the bowls
You gotta know every detail there is to know about this commode
So what you gotta do is take all them details man and make them your own
Τhe only way to do that my brother   keep saying it and saying it and saying it and saying it and saying it
(Freddy) Τhis was during the Los Angeles marijuana drought in 1986
I still had a connection which was insane  cause you couldn't get weed anyfuckingwhere
Αnyway..
I had a connection with this hippy  chick in Santa Cruz and all my friends knew it
"Can you get some for me too?
Like they knew I still smoked  so they asked me to buy some for them when I was buying for me
But it got to be...  Got to be got to be...  Got to be... every time I bought some weed  I was buying for four or five different fuckin' people
Finally I said "Fuck this shit
I'm making this bitch rich.
She never even had to meet these people
I was doing all the work
But then that got to be a pain in the ass
I couldn't even rent a fuckin' tape without six fuckin' phone calls interrupting me
"When's the next time you're getting some?
Motherfucker
I'm trying to watch Τhe Lost Boys
"When I get some I'll let you know.
I got all my shit laid out in $60 bags
Τhey don't want $60 worth
Breaking it up is a major fuckin' pain in the ass
I don't even know what $10 worth looks like
Τhis is a very weird situation
I don't know if you remember back in '86 there was a major fuckin' drought
Nobody had anything
People were living on resin smoking the wood in their pipes for months
Τhis chick had a bunch  and she's begging me to sell it
She had a brick of weed she was selling she didn't wanna go to the buy alone
Ηer brother usually goes with her but he's in County unexpectedly
What for
Ηis traffic ticket's got a warrant
Now she doesn't wanna walk around alone with all that weed
I don't wanna do this
I have a very bad feeling about it
She keeps asking me keeps asking me keeps asking me
Now we're picking the guy up at the train station...  You go to the station to pick up the buyer with the weed on you
Τhe guy needed it right away
Don't ask me why
Anyway we get to the train station and we're waiting for the guy
I'm carrying the weed around in one of those  little carryon bags I gotta take a piss
I tell the connection I'll be right back I'm going to the boys' room
So I walk in the men's room and who's standing there
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs and a German shepherd
When I walk through the door they all stop what  they were talking about and they looked at me
(Laughs) Τhat's hard man
Τhat's a fuckin' hard situation
Τhe German shepherd starts barking
(Barks)  Ηe's barking at me
I mean it's obvious he's barking at me
(Barks)  Εvery nerve ending all my senses  blood in my veins everything I have is screaming  "Τake off man
Just get the fuck out of there!
First there's the shock of it
Bam right in the face
I'm just standing there drenched in panic  and all these sheriffs are looking at me and they know man
Τhey can smell it sure as that fuckin' dog can
Τhey can smell it on me
(Dog barks)  (Cop) Shut up
(2nd cop) So anyway...  (Dog whimpers)  I got my gun drawn right  and I got it pointed right at this guy and I tell him "Freeze
And this little idiot's looking right at me nodding  and he's saying "I know I know I know.
But meanwhile his right hand is creeping towards the glove box
And I scream at him
"Put your hands on the dash!
And he's still looking at me nodding his head  you know "I know buddy
I know
I know.
Αnd meanwhile you know his hand is still going for the glove box
And then this guy's girlfriend this real sexy Oriental bitch you know  she starts screaming at him "Chuck
What are you doing?
"Listen to the officer
Put your hands on the dash!
So you know then like nothing the guy snaps out of it  and casually puts his hands on the dash
(2nd cop) Ηis fuckin' registration
(Cop laughs) You're kidding
(2nd cop) No
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close he came to getting blown away
(Dryer drowns out conversation)  (Barks)  bonehead running around the neighbourhood
Police brutality
(Joe) You knew how to handle that situation
You shit your pants and dive in and swim
(Man) Tell me more about Cabot
(Freddy) I don't know
He's..
I don't know
He's funny
He's a funny guy
Oh yeah with that invisible bitch and "Flame On" and shit

I'll make you a bet that those same damn  niggers who are showing their ass in public  when their bitches get 'em home they chill out
Not these guys
I'll tell you guys a story
In one of Daddy's clubs there's a black cocktail waitress named Εlois
Εlois
Yeah Εlois
ΕLois
We called her Lady Ε
Compton
Ladera Ηeights  that's the black Beverly Ηills
No it's not the black Beverly Ηills
(Laughs)   it's the black Palos Verdes
(Laughs)  Anyway Lady Ε I mean she was a maneaterupper
Εvery guy who ever laid eyes on her  had to jack off to her at least once
You know who she looked like
She looked like Christie Love
Remember that TV show Get Christie Love!  about the black female cop
She always used to say  (Both) "You're under arrest sugar.
(Laughs)  Who was the chick who played Christie Love
Pam Grier
No it wasn't Pam Grier
Pam Grier did the film
So who was Christie Love
Ηow the fuck should I know
Great now I'm totally fuckin' tortured
Whoever it was it doesn't matter
Anne Francis
No that was Ηoney West
Anne Francis is white
Shut up
I'm trying to tell a story here
Anyway... l come into the club one night  and there's Carlos  he's the bartender
Ηe's a wetback
Ηe's a friend of mine
Now apparently Lady Ε was married to a real piece of dog shit
I mean a real fuckin' animal
Ηe used to do things to her
Do things
Do things like what
Did he beat her up or something
I don't know what he did
Ηe just did things all right
She waits for this bag of shit to get drunk  he falls asleep on the fuckin' couch  she sneaks up on him puts some wacko glue on his dick...   Ohh
..And glues his dick to his belly
No
Jesus Christ
I'm serious man
I'm serious
Τhey had to call the paramedics to cut the prick loose literally
(Freddy) ..do some crazy things with it
(Laughs)  Ηow would you feel if every time you had to  take a piss you had to do a fuckin' handstand
(Laughter)  You guys like to tell jokes and giggle and kid around huh
Giggling like a bunch of young broads in the school yard
Five guys sitting in a bullpen in San Quentin  wondering how the fuck they got there
"What did we do wrong
What shoulda we done?
What didn't we do
"It's your fault my fault his fault.
Finally someone comes up with the idea "Wait a minute"  "while we were planning this caper all we did was sit around and tell fuckin' jokes.
Got the message
Fellas I don't mean to holler at you
When this caper's over and I'm sure it's gonna be a successful one  hell we'll go down the Ηawaiian islands I'll laugh with all of you
You'll find me a different character there
With the exception of Εddie and myself who you already know  we're gonna be using aliases on this job
Under no circumstances  do I want any one of you to relate to each other by your Christian names  and I don't want any talk about yourself personally
Τhat includes where you been your wife's name where you might have done time  or a bank that you robbed in St Petersburg

Ηere are your names
Mr Brown  Mr White  Mr Blonde  Mr Blue Mr Orange   and Mr Pink
Because you're a faggot all right
(Mr Brown laughs)   Why can't we pick our own colors
No way
No way
Τried it once it doesn't work
You get four guys all fighting over who's gonna be Mr Black
Τhey don't know each other so nobody wants to back down
No way
You're Mr Pink
Be thankful you're not Mr Yellow
Mr Pink sounds like Mr Pussy
Ηow about if I'm Mr Purple
Τhat sounds good to me
I'll be Mr Purple
Some guy on some other job is Mr Purple
You're Mr Pink
Who cares what your name is
Yeah that's easy for you to say
You have a coolsounding name
All right look if it's no big deal to be Mr Pink do you wanna trade
Τhis ain't a goddamn fuckin' city council meeting you know

Let's go to work
(Mr White) Let's go over it
Where are you
I don't let anybody go in or go out
(Mr Orange) Mr Brown waits in the car
Ηe's parked across the street
When I signal he pulls up in front of the store
Mr Blonde and Mr Blue
Crowd control
Τhey handle customers and employees
Τhat girl's ass
(Laughs)  Myself and Mr Pink
Ah you two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds
We're there for those stones period
Since no display cases are being fucked with no alarms should go off
What happens if the manager won't give you the diamonds
When you're dealing with a store like this they're insured up the ass
Τhey're not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever
If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson  take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in
It drops them right to the floor
Εveryone jumps
Ηe falls down screaming blood squirts out of his nose   freaks everybody out
You might get some bitch talk shit to you  but give her a look like you're gonna smash her face next
Watch her shut the fuck up
(Laughs)  Now if it's a manager that's a different story
So if you get one that's giving you static  he probably thinks he's a real cowboy  so you got to break that son of a bitch in two
If you wanna know something and he won't tell you cut off one of his fingers
Τhe little one
Τhen tell him his thumb's next
Αfter that he'll tell you if he wears ladies' underwear
I'm hungry

I'm gonna die I know it
(Freddy moans)  (Sniffs)  What the fuck happened
Ηe slashed the cop's face cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive
What
I said...  Blonde went crazy
Ηe slashed the cop's face cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive
Τhis cop
Worse or better
Εddie he was pulling a burn man
When you guys walked through the door  he was gonna blow you to hell and make off with the diamonds
What'd I tell you
Τhat sick piece of shit was a stonecold psycho
You could've asked the cop if you didn't just kill him
I don't buy it
Doesn't make sense
Makes perfect fuckin' sense to me
You didn't see how he acted during the job
We did
Ηe's right about the ear  it's hacked off
You're saying that Mr Blonde was gonna kill you  and then when we got back he was gonna kill us  take the satchel of diamonds and scram
I'm right about that right that's correct that's your story
I swear on my mother's eternal soul it's what happened
Ηe got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items
Ηe could've fuckin' walked
All he had to do was say my dad's name but he didn't he kept his fuckin' mouth shut  and he did his fuckin' time like a man
So Mr Orange...  you're telling me that this very good friend of mine  who did four years for my father  who in four years never made a deal no matter what they dangled in front of him...  you're telling me that now that this man is free  and we're making good on our commitment to him  he's just gonna decide out of the fuckin' blue... to rip us off
Why don't you tell me what really happened
What the hell for
It'd just be more bullshit
Τhis man set us up
Dad I'm sorry but I don't know what the hell's happening
It's all right Εddie I do
Τhat lump of shit's workin' with the LAPD
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talking about

Τhe cocksucker tipped off the cops  and got Mr Brown and Mr Blue killed
Mr Blue is dead
Ηow do you know all this
Ηe was the only one I wasn't 100 percent on
I should have my head examined going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent
You don't need proof when you have instinct
I ignored it before but no more
Ηave you lost your fuckin' mind
You're making a terrible mistake
I'm not gonna let you make it
We're supposed to be fuckin' professionals
Larry look  it's been quite a long time
A lot of jobs

Let's just put our guns down...  and let's settle this with a fuckin' conversation

Early retirement
Not my idea
Doctor's orders
Heart condition
"Angina " he calls it
I'm polishing my badge getting myself used to the idea  of saying goodbye to it
I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile
And I'm thinking about the one loose end I haven't tied up
A young girl who's out there somewhere  helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic
Damn it Hartigan I won't let you do this
You're gonna get yourself killed
You're gonna get us both killed
I'm warnin' you
Let go of my coat Bob
You're draggin' me down with you
I'm your partner
They can kill me too
I'm gettin' on the horn calling for backup
Sure Bob
We'll just wait
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat  gets his sick thrills with victim number four
Nancy Callahan age 11
And she'll be raped and slashed to ribbons
And that backup that we're waitin' on will just so happen to show up  just late enough for Roark to get back to his US Senator daddy
Take a deep breath Hartigan
You're pushin' 60 and you got a bum ticker
You ain't savin' anyone
You got a great attitude Bob
Real credit to the force you are
Think about Eileen
Heck Bob...  maybe you are right
I'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense
[grunts]  to end a partnership
Nancy Callahan age 11
For all I know she's dead already
a very good girl Nancy
[whimpering]  Don't be scared
We're gonna be taking you home soon
But first we're going to introduce you to somebody
He's a very nice man
where Weevil said they took her  and it hits
Wicked spot of indigestion
[groaning]  At least that's what I pray it is
You would risk engenderating ill will on the part of our employers
and Douglas Klump:  two anydirtyjobthereis thugs with delusions of eloquence
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet  remanded to our custody though it may be  remains the property of the son of Senator Roark
Take 'em down fast
[heart beating]  [groans]  Give your heart time to slow down
But it won't slow down
Get over it
She needs you
We're all done here Benny
Let's give them some time together
Give them some privacy
Be with you in a minute Lenny
What kind of beast couldn't get along with a precious little girl like this
You must be awfully scared now
But you've got nothing to be scared of
All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk
Just a nice talk
Just you and me
Don't you cry now
Just take the pill he gave you
Not anymore
Breathe steady old man
Prove you're not completely useless
What the hell
Go out with a bang
I've seen his victims and their twisted little faces  all widemouthed and bugeyed frozen in their last horrible moment of living
No screams
Either I'm just in time or I'm way too late
On your feet old man
Let the girl go
You can't do a goddamn thing to me
You know who I am
You know who my father is
You can't touch me you pieceofshit cop
Look at you
You can't even lift that cannon you're carrying
Cover your eyes Nancy
I mean it baby
Cover your eyes right now
[Hartigan] I take his weapons away
[screaming]   Both of them
don't make it any worse
Don't make me kill you
Doin' fine Bob
[Roark groaning]  I'm ready to kick your ass
Just a few more minutes
Till the backup gets here
Sit down and stay down
I'll kill you if I have to
skinny little Nancy
Can't kill her once backup gets here
Run home Nancy
Hey
He's a crazy man
What a tough man you are
You stay right where you're at
You shoot your partner in the back...  then you try to scare a girl
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod  plug you a couple of times show you how it's done
We could've worked something out
[Hartigan] So slow never stop me
Sit down
You'll never be able to stop me
[screams]   just like you told me to
The sirens are close now
Things go dark
Getting sleepy
It's OK.  She'll be safe
An old man dies  a little girl lives
Fair trade
Just tell me it isn't true John
It can't be true
If you ever want to see me again...  say something now
We're looking at your basic mountain of DNA evidence
The testimony of your own partner  corroboration by six eyewitnesses and that's just so far  and there's your own silence
I'll do what I can but let us just say you are good and screwed
What's shuttin' you up
This whole thing stinks to high heaven
Sure I'll rinse your bedpan and wipe your butt
That's my job
But don't expect any friendly chitchat out of me mister
I heard what you done to that girl
I hope they throw away the key
I don't have to introduce myself do I
You read the papers
You know who I am and what I can do
And I'm doin' you Hartigan
Cold and hard I'm doing you
You blew my son's ear off
You blew his arm off
You even blew his nuts and his pecker off
He's in a coma right now
My boy
He could've been the first Roark to become the president  but you went and turned him into a braindamaged dickless freak
Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful
Power don't come from a badge or a gun
Lying big and gettin' the whole damn world to play along with you
Once you got everybody agreeing  with what they know in their hearts ain't true you've got 'em by the balls
There's what maybe 500 people in this hospital
I could pump you full of bullets right now and I wouldn't even be arrested
Otherwise their lies everything that runs Sin City  it all comes tumbling down like a pack of cards
But I want you firm and fit and healthy
I'm even putting up cash of my own to get you more surgery
Fix that heart condition of yours
I'm gonna make sure of that
You're gonna be convicted of raping that little brat and shooting my boy
You're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison  disgraced destroyed...  alone
Your wife
You tell anybody the truth and they're dead
They won't let me testify
I told the cops that you saved my life and they just acted like I was crazy
They said that you'd done things that you didn't do
I told them you saved me from that Roark creep  but they won't even check me out to see that I'm still a virgin
I'm still a virgin still alive thanks to you
They got it all backwards
Sometimes the truth doesn't matter like it ought
But you'll always remember things right
But stay away Nancy
They'll kill you if you don't stay away
Don't write me
Don't even say my name
Maybe you won't let me visit but I'll still write to you Hartigan
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia.
I'll write you every week... for forever
Sure kid
Now run on home
Bye Nancy
I love you
[groans]  John Hartigan
Mr. Law and Order
Mr. By the Book
I gotta give you credit being a straight arrow for so damn many years  without it catching up with you
It's catching up with you now friend of mine
It's catching up with you but good
Maybe I oughta look at him
Oh
He's hale and hearty Tammy
See
He's the picture of health
[laughing]  That Tammy there she's fine isn't she
I wanted to show you what you won't be getting any of not in prison
You hear me Hartigan
You see that
She flinched
You make her sick
I promised myself I'd pay  and I'm paying it
You don't save a little girl's life  then turn around and throw her to the dogs
Not in my book you don't
They want a confession
They won't get it
There was a letter from Nancy waiting when they put me in solitary
She calls herself "Cordelia" just like she promised
She makes no mention of anything that would give her away
But every Thursday another one arrives
What a sweet kid
She's the only friend I've got the daughter I never had
My sweet Cordelia
Skinny little Nancy Callahan
Eight years pass
Then comes a Thursday when I bound from my cot  excited as a kid at Christmas  only to find myself staring at the damn floor of my damn cell  looking for a letter from Nancy that isn't there
Is she all right
Did something happen to her
Nothing
Two months now
Did they find her
Did they get to her
Stupid old man
Do your math
Nancy's 19 years old
She was a saint to keep it up as long as she did
She's forgotten you old man
You're alone
You're all alone
Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster in the middle of summer
He stinks so bad I want to throw up
Practically knocked my head off the bastard
When I come to I see it
The same kind of envelope Nancy always uses  but there's no letter inside of it
There's something soft something that ought to be alive  a hunk of meat and bone that ought to be the index finger  of the right hand of a 19yearold girl
She was so careful
She never gave away where she lives or where she works
I've got to get out
Nothing else matters
Not my life and not my pride either
It's only one final surrender they want
You got me Roark
[phone ringing]  [sirens wailing]  I'll get it Claire
It's gotta be Marv
He never sleeps and he's always getting himself in deep
Yeah
What
Yes yes
No I'll get right on it right this second
I'll be there by ten I promise
She almost slugged me when I stopped her from hiring a new attorney
When I refused to plead innocent she did slug me
When she hears what I'm gonna do she'll probably slug me again
Hartigan
It's like they were waiting for my call
They're ready to deal
They're practically begging for a deal
One of them promised me you'd be out on parole  if you confessed and expressed regret and all that other dumb crap  that of course we won't go for
No we're getting you out for time served no strings attached
Then we're gonna turn right around and sue those sorry sons of bitches  for false prosecution
You're gonna be a very rich man
Like hell it isn't
Doesn't take a genius to figure out who framed you
But even Senator Roark...  You hung up the phone too soon
We'll use the law the press..
Going to a lot of trouble for nothing
He will never know what hit him
Excuse me
John Hartigan crawling on his belly in front of a parole board  confessing to raping a little girl and blubbering for mercy
No doesn't work
I'm going in there and I'm telling them I'm a twisted wretched child molester
I'm agreeing to anything they want from me
Let's get this over with
hear just the way they want to hear it
I tell them I'm a twisted wretched child molester
I agree to everything they want from me
It's a lot of miles into town Hartigan
You care for a ride
Prison's made you paranoid
Talk about water under the bridge
Christ
Yeah
Eight years
Well if it's any consolation to you...  you made me hate myself
Any word from Eileen
She got remarried four years ago
She had two kids
I'm sorry John
Nah
Don't be
I'm glad
Eileen always wanted kids
She'll make a good mother
with fond farewells to each other  then I go looking for the only human being who means a damn to me:  Nancy
How could they have found out it was you writing all those letters to me
And what have they done to you baby
Not a sound
No sign of life
Has Roark gone to all this trouble just to torture a broken old man  like a kid poking at a fly when he's already torn his wings off
All she does is read and study and write
No diary no phone numbers or addresses written down anywhere
It's a long shot but maybe she's got some friends there
A dead end
Nancy wouldn't have anything to do  with a pack of drunks and losers like this
But if there's anything to be found the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is  or who kidnapped and mutilated her this is the place
Excuse me miss
Wondering if you could help me
I'm looking for somebody
It's not like that
Her name is Nancy
Eyes to the stage pilgrim
She's just warming up
She grew up
Nancy Callahan 19 years old
How little she told me about herself in all her letters for all those years
How the hell did they find her
Then it hits me
I've /ed them straight to her
She hasn't spotted you yet
Turn around and walk out the door
Lead the creep outside
Get that Beretta away from him somehow and kill him
I'm just a horny excon watching an exotic dancer
No Nancy
Don't notice me
Don't recognize me
There's no time to explain
I've made a terrible mistake put you in terrible danger
We need to get out of here right this second
Let me throw some clothes on
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten all about me
Kept me going
Kept me from killing myself
Hurry up will you
Maybe I should drive
Not a chance
Besides from the sound of things you might have to shoot somebody
I don't have a gun
Under the seat
It's loaded and it works
Yeah this'll do
Kicks like a mule
Hartigan there's so much I've wanted to say to you
I've lain awake nights thinking of you
What are you talking about
Keep driving Nancy
Keep driving and keep the car on the road
What are you doing
Prove you're still worth a damn
Try to keep it on the road Nancy
Throwing away bullets like they were candy
He doesn't know how to take his time
Aim careful and look the devil in the eye
Ah
Stop the car Nancy
What
Stop the car now
Right
Stop the car confirm the kill
Sorry
I got a little rattled
Sit tight
I'll be right back
Let me stay close
Nothing can happen to me when I'm with you
Please
Let me stay close
His blood smells worse than he does
Jesus
[sirens wailing]  We're out of time
I used to welcome the sound
Nothing to do now but find a place for the night  get Nancy calmed down and figure out what on Earth I'm going to do next
The stink... somehow it stays with us all the way to the motel
Your window was thrown wide open
The rooms looked almost empty
That's why I was sure you'd been kidnapped
My window
Robbed again
That's the third time this year
I swore if I ever saw you again I'd show you I grew up strong
But there I was just like before scared and helpless
better if you sit down
all that good with people
When it comes to reassuring a traumatized 19yearold  I'm as expert as a palsy victim doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench
It's always been you Hartigan
It's just nerves making you say that Nancy
You're just exhausted
You need to sleep
Sleep with me
Stop it Nancy
Eight years
It wasn't just gratitude
I tried to fall in love with boys
Even thought I did once or twice
But I was already in love... with you
There's wrong and there's wrong and then there's this
For God's sakes you're just a kid
I love you
I love you too
With all my heart
No Nancy
Recognize my voice you piece of shit cop
I look different but I bet you can recognize my voice
I recognize your voice Junior
Everything's gone straight to hell
I've been suckered into betraying the only friend I've got  put her in the hands of a rapist I thought I'd put down for good
Suckered by a spoiled brat son of a senator
I got a dead man needs to be fetched
I want you to set me up for a party
I've already got the girl you dumb shit
Hey it better be perfect or I'm calling my dad
It better be ready
It better be perfect
My dad..
I'd love him if I didn't hate him
He spent a fortune hiring every expert on the planet  to grow back that equipment you blew off between my legs  just so the old fart can hold out some kind of hope of having a grand kid
Although as you can see there were some side effects
I'm not complaining
And now you've led me back to your darling Cordelia
We wondered who wrote those letters
She left not a clue
Clever girl
And so pretty so pretty
A little old for my taste but I can forgive that just this once
Whatever he does to you don't scream
She'll scream
And you're gonna die knowing that it's all your fault
They've all screamed Hartigan
Dozens of them maybe a hundred
Eight years' worth
Every one of them has screamed
It's gonna be one hell of a show
No way to fight it now
No hope left
No chance
This is the end
No
Give it a shot old man
Keep your neck tight
The window maybe there's an alarm
The window
Keep your neck tight goddamn it
Stay conscious
Stay conscious
The glass
Cut the rope
You can do it
You can do it
to comment with marked displeasure on your rash impulsiveness  in selecting such an eyecatching and impractical car  to heist Mr. Shlubb
An engine of cyclopean power throbs beneath this steel stallion's hood
A worthy concern
Neatly elucidated
I can only express puzzlement that borders on alarm
Tell me where Roark takes the girls or I'll cut your damn head off
In plain English creep
The farm
Every cop on the force  knows about the Roark family's farm and to stay away from it
Shlubb and Klump were packing an arsenal
But at first I'll have to play it quiet
Quiet and nasty
Nancy's car six miles from the farm
"Nobody but me can keep this heap running" she told me
Good girl
The car stalled out on that yellow bastard  and you didn't tell him how to start it up again
I'll bet Junior was furious
I'll bet he slapped you around something fierce
But you stayed strong
You bought a few extra minutes
There's still a chance Nancy
I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm  and make my way through the woods
I'm not halfway there when it hits
I was cured
Blood in it
I don't have to stay alive that much longer anyway
Rotten way to kill a man but it's quiet
Hate yourself later
you stupid cow
[whip lashing]  [Roark grunting]  Do you think I'm tired
Is that it
Do you think I'm getting tired
You're the one who's gonna crack
You'll cry and beg
Oh yeah you'll scream you big fat ugly cow
You'll scream
You're thinking the whip was the worst I could do
That was foreplay
Hartigan was right about you
You can't get it up unless I scream
You're pathetic
It's not wise at all to make fun of me like that
It brings out the worst in me
In too much of a hurry
It can't be
just like I told myself I wouldn't
[man] You tagged him good
[man 2] Perforate the fool
Good advice
It's over
You're dreaming Hartigan
I see your eyes while I fillet the woman of your dreams in front of you
Look at you
You're about to keel over
You can't even lift that cannon
Sure I can
You gave me a scare there for a second there old man
I'm taking no chances with you
First I soften you up and then it's showtime
It's gonna hurt
You're right about that.  
[gasping] ' [sighs]  Sucker
Both of them
[screaming]  Eight long years son of a bitch
is pounding wet chunks of bone  into the floorboards so I stop
Been a pleasure
I didn't scream Hartigan not once
I know it baby
You grew up strong
to the car Nancy stops shaking
Her skin is warm again
Thanks for remembering my coat
And for all the little things
Like saving my life twice
You're not coming along
No
I have friends on their way to collect evidence
I'm gonna blow this whole sick mess wide open
I'm gonna clear my name
I can't lose you not again
You'll never lose me Nancy
the love of my life
Shame to lie to her
I hope she forgives me for it
Sure
Maybe after I've pulled off that miracle I'll go and punch out God
There isn't a prosecutor in the state who'll go after Senator Roark
I killed his only son
The bloodline is cut
He'll use all his power to get revenge on me
He'll find her again
There 'll be no end to it
She'll never be safe
There's only one way to beat him
An old man dies  a young woman lives
Fair trade
I love you Nancy
like the last leaf on a dying tree
I let her hear my footsteps
She only goes stiff for a moment
Care for a smoke
I'll take one
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am
I came here for you
I've watched you for days
You're everything a man could ever want
It's your eyes
All the things I see in your eyes
What is it you see in my eyes
I see a crazy calm
You're ready to face what you have to face
But you don't want to face it alone
No
I don't want to face it alone
Her perfume a sweet promise that brings tears to my eyes
I tell her that everything will be all right
That I'll save her from whatever she's scared of and take her far far away
[muffled gunshot]  [thunder rumbles]  The silencer makes a whisper of the gunshot
I hold her close until she's gone
I'll never know what she was running from
I'll cash her check in the morning
Oh Mom don't go on like that
I could've gotten in a traffic accident anywhere
Yeah just a fracture
The doctor said it's a clean break
Uhhuh
Mmhmm
and you can find... anything
Becky
Care for a smoke
Love you too Mom
It's a lousy room in a lousy pan' of a lousy town
I'm staring at a goddess
I want you
like angels ought to smell
The perfect woman
The goddess
I need you
Three hours later and my head is feeling several sizes too big
And that cold thing happens to my stomach
And I realize Goldie's dead
You'd have to check her pulse or notice those perfect breasts of hers  aren't moving like if she was breathing
She was murdered and I was right here when it happened
Lying next to her stone drunk just like she was
Damn it Goldie
Who were you and who wanted you dead
Who were you besides an angel of mercy  giving a twotime loser like me the night of his life
So why the sleazy saloon
Why the kindness Goldie
too much showing up before anybody  but me and the killer could know there's been a murder
Somebody paid good money for this frame
No reason at all to play it quiet
No reason to play it any way but my way
I'll be right out
why you died Goldie
I don't know why and I don't know how I never even met you before tonight  but you were a friend and more when I needed one
And when I find out who did it  it won't be quick and quiet like it was with you
And when his eyes go dead the hell I send him to  will seem like heaven after what I've done to him
I love you Goldie
[siren blares in distance]  [helicopter passing]   Claire
Now don't worry Lucille
You got any beers around this place
No way I'm giving you any alcohol
Besides it's not what you came here for anyway is it
No
You're worse without 'em
Thanks
She's a dyke but God knows why
With that body of hers she could have any man she wants
The pills come from a girlfriend who's a shrink
She tried to analyze me once but she got too scared
Haven't seen you like this in a while
Got in a fight with some cops
Not that I know
But they know they've been in a fight that's for damn sure
There ain't no squaring it
Not this time
This isn't some barroom brawl
Hey hey
This is big
Settle down Marv
Take another pill
There ain't no settlin' down
This is blood for blood and by the gallons
This is the old days and the bad days the allornothing days
There's no choices left
Prison was hell for you
It's gonna be life this time
Hell's waking up every goddamn day and not even knowing why you're here
But I'm out now
It took somebody who was kind to me getting killed to do it
But I'm out
I know exactly what I gotta do
Sweet Gladys
But I'll have to sneak past Mom  and her ears have gotten a whole lot better since she went blind
Every week she dusts it all off so it looks like it was only yesterday  that I moved out
Every time I come visit she has me sleep in here  and the old smells make me cry like they do right now
I knew Gladys would be safe here
I call her Gladys after one of the sisters from school
For a while we just get the feel of each other back
Good as ever
I tell her about Goldie and what we have to do
Is that you baby
Yes Mom
I'm sorry I woke you up
I couldn't sleep for the worry
There were men here looking for you
It was about my job
I got a new job
It's night work
What did you do to your face
Oh I... cut myself shaving
You're getting confused again aren't you
weren't you Goldie
Somebody wanted you dead and you knew it
So you hit the saloons the bad places  looking for the biggest meanest lug around and finding me
Walk down the right back alley in Sin City...   Leave your hands off Nancy
That coat looks like Baghdad
So does your face
Take off
He's new here Marv
He didn't know
Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy  shoulder to shoulder with all the other losers like me
But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight
I'm looking for something small and hairy
Take it easy Weevil
I'm here to do you a favor
It's money in your pocket
Spread the word
What'll it be Marv
A shot and a brew Shellie and keep 'em comin'
Sure honey
You take it slow now
Or in a Roman arena taking a sword to other gladiators like him
They'd have tossed him girls like Nancy back then
Show's over dickwad
Drink up
That's one finelooking coat you're wearing there
Your killin' days are over you overthehill dogooder son of a bitch
you do to them you don't feel bad
[Marv] Take it off
All right it's all yours
Oh God
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie
The guy who did that he knew what he was doing
So tell me man
I don't hear you giving me any names
So I guess when I shot you in the belly I aimed a little too high
[screams]  [gunshot]  and I'm gonna have to get really nasty
It was Telly... Telly Stern passed me the order
He runs the tables over to the Triple Ace Club
Thanks again
damnedest thing happens
Just need my medicine is all
Bastard
Feel like talking Louie
How many got paid off for the frame Louie
It was Connelly
He set me up
He'll never talk
I don't know about you but I'm havin' a ball
I don't want to keep you up all night  so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch
These here hands of mine they got blood all over 'em
You're speaking figuratively
When I need to find something out I just go out and look for somebody  that knows more than me and I go and I ask them
Sometimes I ask pretty hard
By way of a "for instance" I killed three men tonight
Tortured 'em first
First two were minnows smalltime messengers
Dear Lord man this is a house of God
Just give me a damn name
Roark
You really are pushing your luck  feeding me garbage like that
It can't be that big
There's a farm at North Cross and Lennox
Find out for yourself
And while you're at it  ask yourself if that corpse of a slut is worth dying for
Worth killing for
[gunshot]  Worth going to hell for
Amen
His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes  or at least that's what they're passing off as a Mercedes these days
[grunts]  Goldie
[grunts]  It couldn't be Goldie
It's my own fault and nobody else 's that I got confused
I've been having so much fun I forgot to take my medicine
That wasn't Goldie back there
Goldie's dead  and that's the whole reason that I've been doing what I've been doing
When you got a condition it's bad to forget your medicine
The cold thing  it creeps into my gut and tells me one more time it won't let go
People have died here...  [soft growling]  the wrong way
[barking growling]  I don't want to fight pooch
Easy boy
my gun on you buddy
It's whoever owns you I'm curious about  because there's blood on your breath and I think I know what kind
So I sniff around to see what's buried
Here we go
Nobody can sneak up on me
I go blind
Not a sound
Nobody's that quiet
Except the one who snuck into that hotel room two nights ago
You killed her
You killed Goldie
It was... [grunts]   I found your killer but he was better than me
Too quiet too quick
Why didn't he finish the job
He keeps the heads
He eats the rest
It's not just that wolf of his
The wolf just gets scraps
Bones
He... eats... people
He cooks them like they were steaks
Just like they were steaks
Now he's got both of us
It's all right
Take a nice slow breath
Just look at the heads on the wall
The heads on the wall
Son of a bitch
He kept smiling that damned smile
He made me watch him suck the meat off my fingers
Oh Jesus
Christ I could use a cigarette
gotta do is let it out
And a few buckets later there's no way you'd know
You've brought us some big trouble this time Marv
Whoever's behind this whole thing has his connections right in the department
One guy I talked to told me it was Roark running the show
Whoever it is he knew I was checking out that hooker almost before I did
What hooker
The one you've been obsessing over
The dead one
I didn't know she was a hooker
Doesn't make any difference about anything
She was highclass stuff
Must have shown you quite a time
Quiet
There's a car coming
and a name
I'll see you later Kevin
They're done checking the house
Bastards
I'll show them.  
[grunts]  [thudding]  You're not gonna get either of us killed Marv
No don't shoot
Please
Listen to me
I'm his parole officer
Here's a sign
[screaming]   That there is one damn fine coat you're wearing
I just killed and what he told me
I was pretty steamed about what he'd done to Lucille  so I took my time with that son of a bitch
It wasn't till I showed him all those pieces of himself that he said it
Could've become president but he chose to serve God
Along the way he happened to become the most powerful man in the state
He's brought down mayors and governors like they were nothing
He even made his rotten brother a US senator without breaking a sweat
And here he's gonna get killed in the name of a dead hooker
I'm getting used to the idea
More and more I'm liking the sound of it
What if I'm wrong
I've got a condition
I get confused sometimes
And with Lucille dead I can't get my medicine
A maniac
A psycho killer
Can't kill a man without knowing for sure you ought to
I've gotta know for sure
The merchandise is on display by the time I make my way to Old Town
I don't get any answers but I know I'm bound to
Lucille said Goldie was a hooker  and if she was she has roots here:  Friends maybe even family
You can't be Goldie
Goldie's dead
I haven't eaten anything or taken my medicine for days now
No wonder I'm seeing things
Bastard
Hit him again Wendy
Harder
Wait a minute
Why did she call you Wendy
My twin sister
I guess she was the nice one
Goldie and the other six where are they
What did you do to them
Just take a look at this mug
Would any of you dames let me get close enough to you to kill you
None of you would but Goldie
And she only did because she thought I could protect her
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn thing about those other girls did they
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy they showed up guns blazing
But they didn't get me and I've been killing my way to the truth ever since
So go ahead doll
OK I'm glad we got all that sorted out
What the hell
I tied those knots
That's my specialty
You sat there and took it  when you could've taken my gun away any time you wanted to
Well sure
And I probably would have had to paste you one  and I don't hurt girls
I need a pair of handcuffs
What style do you want
I got a collection
Just give him the ones you got with you Gail
It was a farm boy named Kevin who killed Goldie  but it was Cardinal Roark who was behind it and I don't know why
Goldie worked the clergy
a puzzle piece falls smack in my lap
I'm too dumb to put the whole picture together yet  but she fires up two cigarettes and hands me one  and I taste her lipstick on it
And suddenly my heart's pounding so loud I can't hear anything else
I want to reach over and touch her and taste Goldie's sweat one more time
But she isn't Goldie
I'm gonna be needing a dozen twofoot lengths of this rubber tubing...  and a spool of razor wire...  and a pair of those special gloves that'll let me handle the wire
the old home security huh
Why are you willing to go up against Roark for someone you barely knew
She was nice to me gave me something I didn't even know existed
I wasn't never even able to buy a woman
and I crawl back inside myself
I check the list: rubber tubing gas saw  gloves cuffs razor wire hatchet  Gladys and my mitts
We're close enough
Pull over
Yes Marv
Keep the engine runnin'
If I'm not back in 20 minutes you get the hell outta here and don't look back
Kill him good
I won't let you down Goldie
to the kitchen
Getting himself a midnight snack and I can guess what kind
Is that the best you can do creep
That's right
Get personal get close
I got you you little bastard
Let's see you hop around now
and breathe the fire out of my lungs
Let me do it Marv
She was my sister
Let me finish him
You wasn't supposed to come down here Wendy
Oh but I want to..
I'm sorry kid but I haven't even started with this creep  and I don't want you watching the rest
It'll give you nightmares
And it's not that fight of ours that did me in either
It's all that sawing and tying
It's not as easy as it looks
I gotta admit there was a spurt or two  to get the scent in the air to get that friend of yours to come running
Well what do you know
Look who's here
[growling]  That's a good dog
not even when the mutt's had its fill  and Kevin's guts are lying all over the place
Somehow the bastard is still alive still staring at me
Not even when I grab the saw and finish the job
I put in a call to Kadie 's and ask Nancy to get her clothes on  and meet me at her place
She says "Yes" like always
Hey Nancy you got any beers
Sure Marv
Who's the babe
Not since a year back when a frat boy roughed her up  and I straightened him out but good
It really gets my goat when guys rough up dames
Well your best bet is drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks
What about you
Are you leaving town
Hell no
I like it here
and stay under the speed limit  so as not to get any attention
My head starts to clear
I owe you Goldie
So if going after Roark means dying win or lose  hell I'll die laughing if I know I've done this one thing right
Quiet as a grave out here
No sign of target
Kevin
The dog ate the rest
Oh my God
You monster
You demon
Don't scream or I'll plug you
And he's dead now because of one stupid whore
It's not a real good idea for you to talk about Goldie  that way while I'm around
When he came to me...  he was a tormented boy
Tormented by guilt
I tried to counsel him
But the eating it filled him with white light
What the hell do you know
He didn't just eat their bodies he ate their souls
And I joined in
They were all whores
Nobody cared for them
Nobody missed them
And then your... Goldie almost ruined everything
She stayed in public places
And then with you
You'd broke a man's jaw that very night
Who would believe a thug like you
I ordered the police in for you but you wouldn't be caught
You wouldn't stop
And now he's dead and you're here to...  eliminate me
Will that give you satisfaction my son
Killing a helpless old fart
The killing no
Kevin...  we're going home
You can scream now if you want to
It's just like I promised only better
And when his eyes go dead the hell I sent him to  must seem like heaven after what I've done to him.  
[man 2] Oh my God
[heart monitor beeping]  [Marv groans] Jerks
They should've shot me in the head and enough times to make sure
It's so stupid
Everybody knows what's coming but they go through the motions anyway
What a waste of time
Night after night I wait for somebody to come and finish me off
After a while I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that
I'm on my feet for ten minutes  before the cops kick them out from under me
They don't ask me any questions
And I keep spitting blood all over it  and laughing at how many fresh copies they come up with
Then along comes this worm assistant district attorney  who turns the recorder off and says if I don't sign their confession  they'll kill my mom
I break his arm in three places and I sign it
They nail me for the works not just the people I did kill  but even Lucille and the girls that Roark and Kevin ate  and even Goldie
The judge is all fire and brimstone when she hands down the sentence
Midnight and my death are only a few hours away  when I get my first surprise in 18 months
I'm ready for anything but that scent
I got 'em for you good didn't I Goldie
Oh I'm sorry Wendy
I..
Just seeing you like this
You can call me Goldie
like angels ought to smell
The perfect woman
Goldie
She says her name is Goldie
They fix me a pretty decent steak for my last meal
They even throw in a brew
Then they shave my head and fix me with a rubber diaper and get to it
And it's about damned time if you ask me
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow..."  Would you get a move on
I haven't got all night
Hit it
Is that the best you can do you pansies
He's gone
Forget it man
You can bang on that door all night if you want to
There is no way in hell I'm letting you in
you're doing this to me Shellie
Everything we've shared..
It meant plenty
Plenty of lost pay on account of how nobody wants  to flirt with a waitress whose face is all purple and swollen up with bruises
I know you're angry baby
There's a difference between getting honked off at a guy who's not so bad  and finding out that you've been sweettalked by a total jerk loser  who skips out on a wife he doesn't even tell you about  every time he gets drunk which is way too often
Especially the kind of total jerk loser  who has to beat up on a girl to make himself feel like a man
It's one thing for you to play hard to get  but don't go trying to cut my nuts off
I am impossible to get
Do yourself a favor Jackie Boy and get help  like... a shrink
Go ahead and open the door Shellie
I'll take care of this
Just open the door and you'll see how wrong you've been about me
Oblige him Shellie
I'm ready for him
No
If he knew that you were here with me   you don't know how bad this could get
He's got four friends out there in the hall  breathing hard and just as drunk as he is
Hey I could swear I heard somebody in there with you just now
Somebody
I'm no racist
I mean I got me all five starters  half the bench of the Basin City Blues keeping me company
You feel like taking them on
Some of my best friends..
But you're really pushing my buttons
OK baby you know what I can do
One two...  All right then
All right
All right all right
Troops make yourself at home
You brought your whole pack with you
You're gonna love this baby
Call up some of your friends who work the saloon
With you and the bunch of us we're gonna hit every joint in town   and it's gonna be great
I ain't calling up nobody
That's a man's shirt and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine
You got somebody's love stink all over you
You've been with another man and you've been with him tonight
He's Superman
[Jackie Boy chuckling]  I have no feelings at all
just go ahead and get it over with you sick bastard
lying about me again  right in front of my friends
I have never hit a woman in my life
That's showing her man
You goddamn coward
Baby we're here to have a good time
Yeah
I gotta take a leak
Then you could've met my boyfriend
Could've seen what a real man looks like
There you go after my nuts again
[scoffs]  I'm a generous guy
He is generous
But that temper of his...  You never should have picked on him like you did
My temper you don't have to worry about
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself or I'll cut your little pecker off
I've been told
Oh you don't wanna be hitting the streets dressed like that
You got a couple phone calls you ought to make
Answer me
Oh I don't need this grief
Hi
I'm Shellie's new boyfriend and I'm out of my mind
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again you even think her name  and I'll cut you in ways that'll make you useless to a woman
A big mistake
Yeah
You already made a big mistake yourself
You didn't flush
No questions damn it
No questions
Now
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine
How's your jaw
I've been slapped around worse
Dwight he was from a while back  before you showed up again with that new face of yours
And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him
And it was only once
Seeing how I'm one of those dumb things  I can't give you too hard a time about that
But this guy he's a menace
He might kill somebody if I don't stop him
No don't go
I can't make out  over the racket of a passing police 'copter
Stop
It sounds like "stop"  but I can't be sure
They're a pack of predators and they're out for blood tonight: a woman's blood
Damn it Dwight
Damn it
You damned fool
across the park  to pick up Jackie Boy heading like a bat outta hell up the hill
I'm speeding
If you're a murderer with a new face who's one fingerprint check away  from the fast track to the gas chamber like I am  the last thing you want is to get noticed
I don't have nearly enough cash on me to bribe this cop and even if I did  there's the outside chance he's one of the honest ones
Do I try to talk my way out of this or do I take this cop down and risk it all
Then Jackie Boy saves me a great big steaming pile of trouble
Watch it Jack
[horn honking]   [tires screeching]  [siren wailing]  Cops
They're right on our ass
Not where we're headed
Jackie Boy's leading us straight to Old Town
He knows he's not the law not in Old Town
The ladies are the law here beautiful and merciless
If you've got cash and play by the rules  they'll make all your dreams come true
But if you cross 'em  you're a corpse
I called it
Was I right
You're always right Jack
But I heard things about these girls
Things they'd done to guys who got out of line
Who's out of line
Ha
Hey baby
Hop in sugar
We'll get you there
Aw sweetheart I work the day shift and it's been a long day
Besides I don't do group jobs
Get in the car baby
It'll be nice
I don't do talk jobs either
Baby doll I've had me one hell of a bad day
I've been beat up every time I turn around
But the day I get turned down by a hooker  when I got good hardearned cash to pay her with  well there's only so much a man can take
That's the Alamo not the Amigo
The Amigo's a fag joint
a good time humiliating me like this  for no damn reason at all
We've been on top of these peckervvoods  since they showed up with that cop behind them
Everything's under control
Enjoy the show
The ladies are their own enforcers
How's the barmaid
You know the one that never shuts up
Not right now Gail
Ooh
That's your whole problem Dwight
You worry too much
These days anyway
Damn it Gail
Not right now
Those clowns down the way they some of the barmaid's boyfriends
One of them thinks he is
I followed them here to make sure he didn't hurt any of the girls
Us helpless little girls
to hit less than 20 yards ahead of us  and still it's hard to take my eyes off her
Us girls are safe as we can be Lancelot
Those boys in that Chrysler are one mistake away  from seeing what Miho can do
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge
Deadly little Miho
[girl] You're running out of alley
Save yourself and your buddies a ton of grief
a sassy little thing
You ain't hardly in any kind of position to be making threats
locked and ready to spring
So what
They're scum
They deserve what's coming
They haven't killed anybody I know about
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place but they didn't kill anybody
And they won't
Something Shellie said
OK OK OK
I sounded off a little more than I should have
Over the edge
It's not a woman you need
You couldn't handle a woman the state you're in
She's saying you ain't got what it takes Jack
You wanna see it
You wanna see what I got
Huh
You seen this one
Get in the car
Oh sugar you just gone and done the dumbest thing in your whole life
Oh God no
Out of nowhere for no reason at all
Go ahead
Go ahead
He's got the drop on her
He's got squat
He's dead
He's just too damn dumb to know it
I got you right where I want you
This is a careerending wound whore
And there's gonna be hell to pay
Watch your step Jackie Boy
This isn't funny
I got friends you can't imagine
Every one of you is gonna burn
You're only making it worse
You shut the hell up
Don't pull the trigger
She blocked the barrel
I told you to shut up
What's happening
I can't see
I can't hear anything
For God's sake Miho finish him
Yeah
Make it quick will you
quite chop his head off
She makes a Pez dispenser out of him
I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants
MasterCard Discover Platinum American Express  and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties  that I'm not too proud to stuff into my own pockets
Then I find an atom bomb
Jackie Boy  you son of a bitch
There was a helicopter that kicked up such a racket  I couldn't quite make out what she said
She said "cop.
Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty
Iron Jack the papers call him
A goddamn hero cop
It's held for years the shaky truce
The cops get a slice of the profits  and free entertainment when they throw a party
They get to defend their own tun'
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood  and he's not shopping for what the girls are selling they send him packing  but they send him back alive
That's the truce
The cops stay out
That keeps the girls free to keep the pimps and the mob out
Old Town will be left wide open
The streets will run red with blood
Women's blood
The cops
Things are gonna go back to the way they used to be
The hell they will
We got guns
We'll fight the cops and the mob  and anybody else who tries to move in on us
[Dwight] Don't be stupid
You wouldn't stand a chance
Get me a car
Make sure it's a hardtop with a decent engine
Did you forget that cop car that trailed them here
The cops know Rafferty came here
They'll check the river they'll check the sewer
They'll find him and come gunning for us
I'll haul the bodies to the pits
The cops won't check
Who do you think you are giving orders
You got what you wanted out of us
Shut up Gail
You got what you wanted out of me
Gone until you brought this unholy mess on us
One word from Gail and she'll cut me in half
They'll be watching the roads
They'll catch you
It'll be the bad old days all over again
The pimps the beatings the drugs the rapes
Not yet they won't
Get me a damn hardtop
Get that gun out of my face now
Ah
Bastard
I forgot how quick you are
She almost yanks my head clean off  shoving my mouth into hers so hard it hurts
An explosion that blasts away the dull gray years  between the now and that one fiery night when she was mine
And make sure it's got a big trunk
I'll always love you baby
Just look at that trunk
We'll never fit 'em all in
Um unless there's something else you want me to do  you think maybe I could go home
All this blood and stuffs got me feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl
Sure Becky go home
But don't you talk to anybody not even your mom
They'll never fit in that trunk
Not like this they won't
Miho
You'll catch cold if you don't
Yeesh
Hey Becky
I just want to hear my mom's voice
I won't tell her nothing
Please don't say nothing to Gail
Hey Mom
We were barely able to get the trunk closed as it was  we packed it so tight
There wasn't anything we could do but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me  out where anybody who cares to look will see him
Go ahead take one of his cigarettes
It'll help
You shut the hell up Jackie Boy
You're dead
I'm just imagining this so shut the hell up
Well it tells you something about your state of mind don't it
It's got your nerves shot
It's got you smoking
[wheezing]  Nobody ever really quits
A smoker's a smoker when the chips are down
And your chips are down
I'm fine
You shut the hell up
Will you look at that
Ooh
What are you gonna do when you run outta gas call AAA
You sucker for the babes you
You ain't even gonna make it to the pits
You shut the hell up
I'll make it
Watch it
Ah this is great
Just like being in a buddy movie
_ [Jackie Boy laughing]   Boy you're screwed you're out you're finished
Stick a fork in it
You're swirling around the bottom of the bowl  nosediving down the pipe
It's over
to tell him to shut up
Sure he's an asshole
Sure he's dead
None of that stops the bastard from being absolutely right
I don't have a chance in hell of outrunning this cop
Not in this heap
Pull over
The only question left is whether I'm gonna kill him or not
Tough call
My hand moves all on its own  sliding one of my guns to my lap and thumbing back the hammer
I don't know what to do
Better stop
Whatever you say
I'm the designated driver
Well you're driving with a busted tail light
I'll let you off with a warning
What next
a quarter mile from the pits
I shove the TBird the rest of the way
Jackie Boy will go into the damn tar pits  I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks go home and call it a...  No more questions Dallas
Do what I say
Clear the streets
We're not selling any tail in Old Town
Not tonight
Don't struggle
You'll only hurt yourself
We know everything
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty will be in our possession  and the truce between your prostitutes and the police will be shattered
There'll be arrests
There'll be deaths
My employer will seize what remains of this neighborhood
You will all be slaves
Nothing can stop this
Son of a bitch
I have suffered your kind before the dregs of Sin City
I serve a new master now  and soon you and all your wretched kind will serve him as well
Now get dressed and shed a tear for Dwight McCarthy if you must  because by now he is surely dead
You don't know him
My man will find a way
He always finds a way
This is a fine grand country
Guiding light of the modern world it is
Low taxes land of opportunity
airports and churches  without shite to show for it
Yeesh
You find something Murphy
Looks to be a poor dead cop's badge
What's this stuck in it
Bloody hell
You son of a bitch
Bastard
They were mercenaries
If they were hired by who I think they were  the bad times haven't even started yet
every last inch of the man Brian
Ronnie
Lend me your knife
Should I take a nap while I'm doing all this waiting
I'm at the bone all right
Have you ever seen anything so pretty in your whole life
We'll be back for the three of you and if anyone happens by  use your imagination OK
No air to breathe
Let it in
Let it fill your lungs
They were counting on you and you blew it
Skinny steely fingers at my wrist
Miho you're an angel
You're a saint
You're Mother Teresa
You're God
If you'd shown up ten minutes earlier we'd still have Jackie Boy's head
It's a cinch
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob
First we gotta get Jackie Boy's head  before it gets to wherever it's going and this situation blows wide open
Miho I hope to hell you left one of 'em alive enough to talk
I'm not fooling around
We talk
Stay cool
It's time to prove to your friends that you're worth a damn
Sometimes that means dying
Sometimes it means killing a whole lot of people
There they are
What do we do
We stop 'em Dallas
is close to me  I could almost reach out and grab it right then and there
Get the head
I got it
I got it
Suck on this you stupid slag
So come down and get it
I could've put a bullet straight down your ear just now  if I hadn't got me revolver all wet and useless
You got the drop on me love
I got to come clean with you sweetheart
It was an outright lie I was giving ya about me revolver being wet
You see I'm not too fond of shootin'
It's my preference to blow things up
Once you blast the roof off a pub  and seen all the parts flying off people  a little bang bang's never gonna match the sight of that
You killed me mates
Someone shoulda told ya: never give an Irishman good cause for revenge
You won't feel a thing unless she wants you to
She twists the blade
I tell Miho what we're gonna do and how we're gonna do it
I grab poor Dallas's earphone and make the most important call of my life
First we gotta rescue Gail then comes the kill
The big fat kill
_ [gasping]  [crunching]  Do we just gotta stand here and watch this
What are you kidding me man
I could watch old Manute do his thing all night and not get tired of it
Only an artist should be allowed to touch such a beautiful subject
Your nerves responsive
Beautiful
Just give them what they want Gail
Becky
It's over Gail
Dwight's dead
They got what's left of that cop we killed
Mob's gonna turn it over to the chief cops'll mow us down
We gotta cut a deal
You sold us out
I didn't have no choice
They was gonna hurt my mom
You gotta out a deal with these people
It's selfish you holding out like this
You'll get a lot of girls killed for no good reason
It wasn't your mom
It was the money you stupid little bitch
Sure you could've moved my mom into Old Town  and let her know that her daughter's a goddamn whore
Breaks your heart doesn't it
They offered me what you couldn't never offer me: a way out
I had to watch out for my own neck
Your precious scrawny little neck
You're crazy
You could have ripped my throat out you crazy whore
Stuka kill this one
No I was promised
Stupid little bitch
You deserve worse
Hey
Hey
Nobody
I don't see nobody
Will you look at that
It's right through me
Guys look
Some kind of note
[Manute] Give it to me
Guys look
It's starting to hurt
Out back
Bring the women
Do you think somebody should call me a doctor or something
McCarthy you fool
Hey
Oh...   armed to the teeth
I'm outnumbered outgunned
But the alley is crooked dark and very narrow
They can't surround me
You can have Old Town I don't care
Just give me the woman
[muffled talking]  Shut up
Dwight don't do this
Something's not right
Shut up or I'll plug you
Of course Mr. McCarthy
A fair trade
She's all yours
Exactly what I had to
Every step of the way
No
It isn't right
There wasn't no tape over his mouth
How come there's tape over his mouth
counts for a lot
But there's nothing like having your friends show up with lots of guns
McCarthy you shit
The girls all know the score
No escape  no surrender no mercy
We gotta kill every last rat bastard one of 'em
Not for revenge not because they deserve it  not because it'll make the world a better place
We need a heap of bloody bodies  so when mob boss Wallenquist looks over his charts of profits and losses  he'll see what it cost him to mess with the girls of Old Town
They run out back
Right on schedule
She gets her practice in
The Valkyrie at my side is shouting and laughing  with the pure hateful bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter  and so am I
The fire baby
It'll burn us both
There's no place in this world for our kind of fire  my warrior woman my Valkyrie
You'll always be mine
Always... and never.﻿1 Chapter one last stage to red rock  got room for one more
Names major marquis Warren former U.S. calvary
Currentrly I'm a servant of the court
Tryin' to bringin' a coupla' nogoods into market
I got paperwork on 'em in my pocket
I figure that's where you headed right
That damblasted blizzards been on our ass for the last three hours
Ain't no way we gonna make it all the way to red rock 'fore it catches us
You know I am
May I come aboard
Well smoke..
But it ain't up to me
Who's it up to
Fella' in the wagon not partial to company
Fella' in the wagon he paid for a private trip
And I'm here to tell ya'..
He paid a pretty penny for privacy
So if you wanna' go to minnie's with us...   You gotta' talk to him
Well...  That's what I'll do
Hold it black fella'
'Fore you approach  you take them two guns of yours and lay 'em on that rock over yonder
Real trustin' fella' huh
Not so much
Put 'em down
Come on ahead
I said way above your hat god dammit
Now come forward
That's far enough
Col. Something Warren right
Major marquis Warren
I know you too
You John Ruth the hangman
That be me
How longs that been
Since that steak
Eight months
I'm tryin' to get a coupla' of bounty's to red rock
So you still in business
What happened to your horse
Circumstances caused us to take the long way around
My horse couldn't make it
You don't know nothin' about this filly here
Nope
Don't even know your name
Well I guess that makes this one fortuitous wagon
I sure as hell hope so
Major marquis Warren this here is Daisy domergue
Domergue to you this is maj. Warren
She's a pepper ain't she
Now girl don't you know darkee's don't like bein'  called niggers no more
I been called worse
Now that I can believe
Heard of her
Well she ain't no John wilkes booth but...  Maybe you might of heard tell 'bout the price on her head
How much
Ten thousand dollars
Damn what she do
Kill Lily langtree
Now that ten thousand's practically in my pocket
It's why I ain't too anxious to be handin' out rides
Especially to professionals open for business
Well I certainly can appreciate that
I ain't got no designs on her
That's damn sure good enough for me
Well...  Let me see their paperwork
Like I said molasseslike
Look..
I sure hate to interrupt y'all
But we gtta' cold damn blizzard  hot on our asses we tryin' to beat to shelter
I realize that
Now shut your mouth and hold them damn horses while I think
But you leave those pistols over yonder with the driver
You ain't really gonna' let that nigger ridin' in  here is ya'
I mean maybe up there with o.B. but  how you like the sound of them bells bitch
They are real pretty ain't they
You open up your trashy mouth again I'll knock  out them front teeth for ya'
You got it
Let me hear you say: "I got it.
Well I'm gonna need some help tyin' these fella's up on the roof
Give o.B
Fifty dollars when ya' get to red rock and he'll help ya'
Well I agree with o.B
This storm's got me concerned
Goddammit to hell I'm already regretting this
Now I can't likely help ya' tie fella's to the roof with my wrist cuffed to hers
Now do you got that
Yeah I got it
Good
Translation/timings/creator by: Deluce  so what happend to your horse
He got old
I done had him for a bit
When the weather took a turn for the worse he  done what he could but he couldn't make it
Yes it is
Me an' ole lash rode a lotta' miles together
Never the less..
I'm gonna' miss 'em
Who's Daisy domergue
A no damn good murdering bitch that's who
I can see you ain't got mixed emotions 'bout bringing a woman to a rope
If by woman you mean her
So you takin' her into red rock to hang
You bet
Gonna' wait to watch it
I wanna' hear her neck snap with my own two ears
You never wait to watch 'em hang
My bounties never hang  cause I never bring 'em in alive
Never ever
We talked about this in chattanooga
Bringing desperate men in alive is a good way to get yourself dead
Can't catch me sleepin' if I don't close my eyes
No one said the job was suppose to be easy
No one said it was suppose to be that hard nether
But that little lady  is why they call him "the hangman"
But when John Ruth the hangman catches ya'  you don't die by a bullet in the back
When the hangman catches you... You hang
You overrate 'em nigger
I'll give you he got guts
But in the brains department  he like a man who took a high dive in a low well
Now Daisy  I want us to work out a signal system of communication
When I elbow you real hard in the face...  That means: Shut up
I got it
I..
And I don't mean to unduly imply intimacy
But...  Well...  You still got it
I still got what
Of course
Do you got it on you
Where
Right here
I can imagine you probably don't like to take  it in an'out of the envelope all that often
But if you wouldn't mind  I'd sure appreciate seein' that again
You right  I don't like taking it in an'out of the envelope that much
Yeah
But...  As your saving my life an' all  I suppose I could let you read it again
"Ole Mary Todd's callin' so I guess it must be time for bed"  ole Mary Todd
That gets me too
You know what this is tramp
It's a letter from Lincoln to him
They shared a correspondence during the war
They was pen pals
This is just one of the letters
What the...  O.B
Stop
Whoa easy
I didn't  drag her stikin' ass up this goddamn mountain just  for you to break her neck on the ouskirts of town
You the one handed her my goddamn letter
I didn't give it to her I gave it to you
That nigger like to bust my jaw
And when he do  I'm gonna sit back on that wagon wheel watch and laugh
How is it
But it's alright
Is that the way niggers treat their ladies
You... ain't no goddamn... lady
Hey mister Ruth
What
There's another fella' on foot up here on the road
I said there's another fella' on foot up here on the road
Considering there's a blizzard goin' on  whole lotta' fellas walkin' around wouldn't you say major
Seems to be a lot of 'em
This changes things son
Eight thousand dollars a lotta' money for a nigger
You really think I'm in cahoots wit' that fella'
Or her
Put them on
I ain't wearin' handcuffs
You put those on or you can stop worryin' about this whole thing right now
Chapter two son of a gun  hand your weapons to the driver
Little jumpy ain't you
Never mind the jokes just do it
I do
I done did it
O.B.
Ya' got 'em
I got 'em
Okay fella'  you keep holdin' that lantern in that one hand  and you keep that other hand where I can see it
I'll be a goddamn dog in the manger
Is that you Chris mannix
Not quite
You know this fella'
Only by reputation
Like I said friend  you got me at a bit of a disadvantage
Keepin' you at a disadvantage is a advantage I intend to keep
I don't want no trouble
I just wanna' ride
I'm freezin to death
You heard of the rebel renegade erskine mannix
Mannix's marauders
That's them
The scourge of south Carolina mannix marauders
That's erskine's youngest boy Chris
What brings you in my path Chris mannix
Well Mr. face  I was riding to red rock and my horse stepped in a gopher hole in the snow  fucked up his leg an' had to put 'er down
Yes I do
What
I'm the new sheriff
'Fraid not
Where is your star
Well I ain't the sheriff yet
Once I get there they swear me in but that ain't happened yet
And that's when you get your star
Yeah
And from the look of those three frozen fuckers up there  I figure you're a bounty hunter open for business
And I figure you're taking them three dead bodies into red rock to get paid
Three dead
One alive
Who's that
Who the fuck is Daisy domergue
Not a goddamn thing to nobody except me and the hangman
The hangman
You're the hangman Bob Ruth
It's John
And you..
Your're the nigger with the head...  Major marquis
My lord is that really the real head of major marquis lookin' at me now
What's goin' on y'all havin' a bounty hunters picnic
Never mind you takin' in them three dead bodies  and her to red rock to get paid ain't ya'
Yeah
The man is red rock suppose to pay you is me
The new sherrif
So if you wanna get paid you need to get me to red rock
Well execuse me for findin' it hard to belive a  town electin' you to do anything except drop dead
So I'm suppose to freeze death 'cause you find something hard to belive
No I suppose not
Put them on and come inside
Then you'll freeze
Then you'll hang
How so
Driver
I gotta hold these horses I can hear you just fine from up here
You heard me tell this fella' I'm the new sheriff of red rock right
Yeah
Red rock is my town
No sir
Sorry bushwackers I ain't entering red rock that way
When you finally get to red rock you're going  to realize every goddamn thing I said was right
And I expect you o.B.  to tell the townsfolk of red rock that John  Ruth let their new sheriff freeze to death
You let me die that's murder
Hold out your hands
O.B
One thing I know for sure  this niggerhatin' son of a gun ain't partnered up with you
Now..
I'll help protect your eight thousand  you help me protect my ten  deal
Ain't love grand
Tell ya' what Bob  the name's John
When we get to red rock I'll buy you and major marquis there dinner and booze
May way of sayin' thanks
I don't drink  with rebel renegades and I damn sure don't break bread with 'em
Well Mr. Ruth  you sound like you got a axe to grind against the cause
The cause of a renegade army
Ya' wrapped yourselves up in the rebel flag as an excuse to kill and steal
And this should interest you Warren imparticular emancipated blacks
Sounds like my kinda' fella'
I was a goner and y'all saved me
Shut up
God damnit Daisy it's comin'
Here last piece
Does he know how famous you once was
I don't think so
Black eye
Do you know who he is
Yeah
Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting  but they never did get 'em the right nigger head did they
But it wasn't for lack of tryin'
Them peckawoods left their homes and their families and come to this snowy mountain  lookin' for me and fortune
None of them found fortune
The ones you ain't ever heard of no more  they found me
Now it didn't stay 30 thousand the length of the war
But I bet even when it was five thousand  you had your share of country boys comin' to call
You know I did
Why did they have a reward on you
The confederates took exception to my capacity for killing them
After I broke out of wellenbeck  the south took my continued existence as a personal affront
So the cause put a reward on my head
No reb I ain't never heard of it
You bust out
Maj. Marquis did more than bust out
Maj. Marquis had a bright idea
So bright...  You got to wonder why nobody never thought about it before
Tell John Ruth about your bright idea
Well the whole damn place was just made out of kindling
So I burnt it down
Fortyseven men... Burnt to a crisp
Southern youth farmer's sons   cream of the crop  and I say "let 'em burn"
You joined the war to keep niggers in chains
I joined the war to kill white Southern  crackers and that means kill 'em anyway I can
Stab 'em
Drown 'em
Burn 'em
Drop a big ole' rock on their head
Whatever it took to put white Southern crackers in the ground  that's what I joined the war to do and that's what I did
To answer your question John Ruth  when major marquis burned forty seven men alive  for no more a reason then to give a nigger a run for the trees  that's when the south put a reward on the head of major marquis
And I made them trees mannix
And you best belive I ain't look back till I crossed the northern line
See once they started pullin' out all the burnt bodies at wellenbeck  seems not all of them boys were rebs
How many burnt prisoners they end up findin'
Wasn't the final yankee death count somethin' like thirtyseven
That's the thing about war mannix  people die
So ya' chalkin' it up to "war is hell" ha
Well admittedly that's a hard argument to argue with
But if memory serves  your side didn't look at it that way
I belive they accused you  of being a kill crazy nigger who only joined the war to kill white folks  and the whole blue and grey of it all didn't really much matter to ya'
And that's why they drummed your black ass outta'  the cavalry with a yellow stripe down your back
Isn't it major
Horse shit
I didn't say they could prove it
But they sure did think it out loud didn't they major
But  Warren's war record was stellar and that's what saved his ass
Are you killed yourself your share of  redskins in your day didn't ya' black major
I'll tell a' what the cavalry didn't look kindly on
And the fact that erskine mannix's little boy  would talk about anybody else's behavior  during war time makes me wanna horse laugh
Don't you say anything about my daddy  what he fought for  was dignity in defeat and against the unconditional surrender
We weren't foreign barbatians pounding on the city walls
We were your brothers
Just  how many nigger towns did y'all sack in your fight for dignity in defeat
My faire share black major
'Cuz when niggers are scared that's when white folks are safe
You gonna talk that hateful nigger talk  you ride up top wtih o.B
No no no you got me talkin' politics  I didn't wanna'
Like I said y'all I'm just happy to be alive
I..
And dream about how lucky I am
Chapter three minnie's haberdashery  get in there
Easy
What the hell's going on  we weren't expecting another stage tonight
I just got through putting the horses away
This ain't the normal line
But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard  so it looks like you're stuck with us
Are minnie and sweet Dave inside
They ain't here
He says they ain't here
He's lookin' after the place while they gone
Who are you
I'm Bob
Well whoever you are help o.B
With the horses
Get 'em outta this cold before that blizzard hit's 'em
You need it done fast you need to help
I got two of my best men on it
You heard him freeloaders get to work
Open up
Kick it open
Kick it open
Shut that door there's a goddamn blizzard out there
You gotta' nail it shut
You have to nail it shut
There's a hammer and nails by the door
You have to nail it shut
There's a hammer and nails by the door
Give me a hammer
Yeah
You need to do two pieces of wood
One ain't good enough
That fuckin' thing is busted
Not just one piece of wood
Gimme that other piece of wood
Yeah allright
Here
Jesus
Who's the idiot who broke that that Mexican fella'
Good heavens  a woman  out in this white hell
You must be frozen solid poor thing
Looks like minnie's got her a full house
When did you fella's arrive
The cowboy fella' in the courner is that your driver
No he's a passenger
The driver lit out
He said he was going to  spend the blizzard shacked up with a friend
Jesus Christ that's awful
Christ almighty what that Mexican fella' do soak his ole socks in the pot
He don't have that problem
Where's the well water
Over there
So  all three of you fellas' headed to red rock when the blizzard stopped ya' huh
Yes all three of us were on that stagecouch out there
Coffybeans
Over there
The new sheriff of red rock is traveling with us
Sheriff of red rock that'll be the day
If he is a goddamn sheriff I'm a monkey's uncle
Good
So..
The new sheriff of red rock is traveling with you
No he's lyin'  he ain't sheriff of nothin'  he's a Southern renegade
What the fuck I tell you about talkin' huh
I'll bust you in the mouth right in front of these people I don't give a fuck
John Ruth
Are you a lawman
I'm takin' her to the law
You're a bounty hunter
That's right Buster
Do you have a warrant
'Course I do
Why
How am I suppose to know  you're not a villain  kidnapping this woman without a warrant in your possession
What's your name Buster
Well..
It certainly isn't Buster
It's oswaldo mobray
Oswaldo
Well..
I got my warrant oswaldo
I take it you're Daisy domergue
Yeah it's her
It says here dead or alive
Yeah it does
Wouldn't transporting her be easier  if she were dead
No one said the job was suppose to be easy
And why is her hanging proper so important to you
Let's just say I don't like to cheat the hangman
Well I appreciate that
Allow me to properly introduce myself
I'm oswaldo mobray  the hangman in these parts
Looks like I brought you a customer
Have you ever spent two days or more locked up with one of your customers
Don't talk to my prisoner
I talk to my prisoner that's it
You got it
I got I got
You got anything in here besides coffee that can help warm us up
The bar is open follow moi
All right
All right
Come on goddamnit I'm cold
I'll feed and water the horses
I've got some stew cooking
Should be done soon
Now look...  Now matter how bad this blizzard gets  we still gotta' feed these horses and take a squat from time to time
Okay
Good idea
I'll give you a hand
No no no go inside get warm
You're doing stable work in a goddamn blizzard I offer to help and you say no
You're right mi amigo
All right follow me
We gonna' drop one every ten paces
From here to the door
Yeah
All right
Now you're wanted for murder
For the sake of my analogy let's just assume that you did it
And if... You're found guilty  the people of red rock will hang you in the town square
And as the hangman  I will perform the execution
And if all those things end up taking place  that's what civilized society calls "justice"
However  if the relatives and the loved ones of the person  you murdered were outside that door right now
And after busting down that door they drug you out  in the snow and hung you up by the neck that  we would be frontier justice
The bad part is it's apt to be wrong as right
Not in your case
But other people maybe not so much
But ultimately what's the real difference between the two
The real difference is me..
The hangman
When I hang you I  will get no satisfaction from your death
It's my job
The man who pulls the lever  that breaks your neck will be a dispassionate man
And that dispassion is the very essence of  justice
For justice delivered without dispassion  is always in danger of not being justice
Amen
Yeah well...  You got it
What'cha writing firend
Only thing I'm qualified to write about
What's that
My life story
You're writing your life story
Am I in it
You just entered
Well you like writing stories so much why don't  you tell me the story that brings you here
I am
John Ruth

I wasn't just an ass in a saddle this time  I was a partner
For the first time in my life I  made a pretty penny and eh...  Come home and spend time with my mother for Christmas

'Cuz you don't look like the coming home for Christmas type
Because I definitely am a...  Coming home for Christmas to spend time with mother type
Christmas with mother

John Ruth
For now
Just steer clear of my prisoner

You comin' into red rock to hang Lance Lawson
Precisely
Do you have the execution orders on you
May I see 'em
Who's Lance Lawson
He's a fell' been sittin' in the red rock jail about a month now
He's the fella  who shot the fella'  who was sheriff 'fore me
Precisely
What did she mean when she said  bounty hunter's nigger friend in the stable
He's got a nigger bounty hunter firend in the stable
But all that just to guard her
Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy
Five of you
Well well well looks like minnie's haberdashery  is about to get cozy for the next few days
Yes it does
Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter
The letter from Abraham Lincoln
President Abraham Lincoln
Weren't you pen pals
With the president

Yeah
The nigger in the stable has a letter from Abraham Lincoln
Say your name was again
Bob
Minnie and sweet Dave in there
What
Yeah
They ain't here
Yes they're visiting her mother
Her mother
Yes
I never knew minnie had a mother
Yeah I suppose
And she left you in charge
Si
That sure don't sound like minnie
Are you callin' me a liar
But it sounds peculiar though  what sound peculiar
Well first of minnie never struck me as the sentimental type
Along takin' trips to the north side
That sounds a whole lot like you're calling me a liar mi negro amigo
Yeah it do sound a whole lot like don't it
Minnie still serve food
Do you consider stew food
Yes
Then we serve food
She still stinkin' up the place with her "old quail" pipe tobacco
Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe
She rolls her own
Yeah I do senor Bob
Just seein' if you do
Fill me up o.B
Goddamn it
Thank you
You've got a good eye son
Well I'll be double dogged damned
General Sandy "don't give a damn" smithers
Captain Chris mannix mannix marauders
Erskine's boy
May I sit down sir
According to the Yankees it's a free country
Genaral Sandy smithers..
Boy...  Oh boy
Did my daddy talk about you
Me and my boys did our part
Just like erskine and his boys did their part
Hell yeah we did
I never knew your father son
But I always respected his resolve
Thank you for saying that general
Your respect woulda' meant the world to him
Can I get ya' some coffy
Well how about a blanked
That would be even nicer
Hell you know what you can have mine
Here we go general
If ya' don't mind me askin'
My boy
You gotta' boy that lives in red rock
My son Chester Charles smithers  he died out here a few years back
Forgive me sir
Like I said it was a few years back
He came out here to the hills of Wyoming  to make his fortune
Never to be heard from again
I bought him a symbolic plot  in the red rock cemetery
I'm here to advise the stone maker on his headstone
Was he a goner fer' sure
It's a rough life but folks can learn it
If he had done what he came here to do  he'd a come home
Close it close it
You have to hold it closed while I nail it shut
Really
Fucking hold it low
Okay
Hold it mi negro amigo
Ola mi cabron
There you go motherfucker
That's a lotta' hats senor Bob
Huh
Considering minnie's no hats indoors policy
Which  if I remember it correctly that was one of them bar of iron rules  kinda rule she'd want kept up in her absence
I'm guilty
How about we forget about the hats today  considering there's a blizzard going on and all  and make tomorrow "no hat day"
A large black dog
Labrador
Always said that Davis was a courages man
But he should have put capital in Montgomery and not Richmond
Yes sir
I agree with that the army in north Virginia would've been used in a..
I said the army of north Virginia would have been used in very different way
Shut up
Do you know that nigger sir
I don't know that nigger
But I know he's a nigger
Well that nigger just ain't any nigger
That nigger is  general sanford smithers
Battle of Baton Rouge
Inform the nigger in the cavalry officers uniform  that I had a division of confederates under my commend  in Baton Rouge
Major nigger general smithers wishes me to inform you..
I heard 'em hillbilly
Inform this old cracker that I was in Baton Rouge also
Oh that's interesting
General smithers he said that he was also in Baton Rouge
On the other  cap't mannix tell the nigger  that I don't acknowledge niggers in northern uniforms
But not one colored trooper made it to a camp did they
We had neither the time or the food
So we shot 'em where they stood
Gentlemen  gentlemen  I know Americans aren't apt  to let a little thing like an unconditional surrender get in the way of a good war
But I strongly suggest we don't restage the battle of Baton Rouge  during a blizzard in minnie's haberdashery
Now my nubian friend  while I realize passions are high that was a while ago
Once we arrive in red rock
I damn will guarantee that too
Yeah Warren that's the problem with old men
You can kick 'em down the stairs and say it's  a accident but ya' can't just shoot 'em
We divide minnie's in half
The northern side and the Southern side
With the dinner table  operating as a neutral territory
As long aas the bar's Philadelphia I agree
We still got that deal we talked about in the wagon
I help you protect your eight thousand you help me protect my ten
One of them fella's is not what he says he is
What is he
He's in cahoots with this one that's what he is
One of them maybe even two of 'em is here to see domergue goes free
And to accomplish that goal they'll kill everbody in here
And that's when they strike  huh bitch
If you say so John
Are you sure you're not just being paranoid
Our best bet is this  duplicitous fella' ain't as cool a customer as Daisy here
But waiting for an oportunity and knowing it's the right one isn't so easy
If he can't handle it he'll stop waiting
He'll try and create his opportunity
And that's when mr. Jumpy reveals himself
And what do you got to say about all this
About John Ruth's ravings
He's absolutely right
Me and one of them fella's is in cahoots
And  we're just waitin' for everybody go to sleep
That's when we gonna' kill y'all
Okay everybody  hear this
This here is Daisy domergue
That money's mine boys
Don't wanna' share it
I ain't gonna' lose it
When the sun comes out I'm taking this woman into red rock to hang
Now...  Is there anybody here...  Comitted to stopping me'...  From doing that
Nobody gotta' problem with this
Well I guess that's very fortunate for me
However I hope you all understand  I can't just take your word
When you say precautions...  Why do I feel you mean me
Because I'm gonna' take your gun son
You are
Yes I am
Just mine
The hangman got himself a gun too
I'll be dealing with his gun after I deal with yours
I feel kinda' naked without it
Oh I still got mine
I'll protect you
That's right Joe gage
Now gimmie the gun
You have to come and take  calm down
Take your hand away from your gun
Blink if you're calm
Did he blink
He blinked
Blink if your gonna' remain calm
He blinked
I'm real sorry about this son
Like I said nothing personal
Just a precaution
Pretty sneaky
Precautions must be taken because life is too sweet to lose
Hand me that little bucket
O.B.
Go to the outhouse
Take this bucket and dump it down the shit hole
Your jacket's already on
And I sorta kinda trust you
After you major
I'm gonna' cut you loose while we eat
Don't get any ideas I ain't goin' soft on ya'
You lift your ass even one inch off this seat  I'll put a bullet right in your goddamn throat
So domergue  I suppose this blizzard counts as a stroke of luck as far as you're concerned
You don't hear me complaining do ya'
How 'bout you oswaldo
How about me what
Look  considerin' all the thing I done for money I ain't one to judge
But don't you feel just the least little bad 'bout hangin' a woman
Well hell ozzy I guess I ain't never looked at it like that before
When it comes to some of them mean bastards  out therem it's the only thing does the job
You really only need to hang mean bastards
You goddamn son of a bitch
I almost died out there
You okay o.B.
I'm fine
I'll be fine
I just need to get warm
You want some stew o.B.
Stew later
That's nice
Leave me be from your horseshit
John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln letter
I tole' you jackass to heehaw somewhere else
That's right John
You did say didn't ya'
Yeah I did
Yes
Thee Abraham Lincoln
Yes
Abraham Lincoln the president of the United States..
Yes
Yes
Wrote you a letter personally
Yes
Personally
No
Personally as in: "Dear marquis"
"Dear marquis" Abraham Lincoln the president of the United States of America
Yes
May I see it
Way John tells it   y'all hada' correspondence
Yes
Way John tells it y'all's practically pen pals
Yes
And a pen pal's..
Practically a friend
John Ruth  you really think a nigger drummed outta' the  calvary with a yellow stripe down his back  was practically friends with the president of the United States of America
John Ruth I hate to be the one to break it to ya' but nobody in minnie's haberdashery  had ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln  least of all that nigger there
Course it was
You can't trust a fuckin' word that comes outta' your mouth
What's the matter John Ruth
I hurt your feelings
As a matter of fact you did
I know  I'm the only black son of a bitch you ever met so I'm gonna' cut you some slack
The only time black folks are safe  is when white folks is disarmed
And this letter  had the desired effect of disarming white folks
Call it what you want  I call it a dirty fuckin' trick
You wanna' know why I'd lie about something like that white man
Well I'll tell you like the lord tole' John  a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't have that kinda' effect on me
I might let a whore piss on it
I spit on it
Warren goddamit you leave that old man alone
Stand down you son of a bitch I shared a battle field with this man
Or would you deny me that too
May I join you
Yes you may
Damn it
So  how's life since the war
Got both my legs
I can't complain
Got a woman
Fever took her started this last winter
What was her name
Georgia girl
Augusta
Atlanta boy and a Augusta girl
I use to raise Kentucky horses
Her paw' was the owner of the breedershit where I brought of my ponies
I made good deal on her
Took the stake he gave and bought a bunch peach ochards
Set myself up pretty well
Did a hellva' lot better than my no good brothers that's for damn sure
Yeah your son came up here a few years back
You knew my boy
Yeah...  Yeah I knew 'em
Suit yourself
Didja' know my son
I know the day he died  do you
You wanna know what day that was
The day he met me
He came up here to do a little nigger head huntin'
By then the reward was so five thousand and bragging rights
But back then to battle hard rebs five thousand just to cut off a niggers head  now that's good money
So the Johnny's climbed this mountain lookin' for fortune
But there was no fortune to be found
All them fella's came up here sang a different tune  when they found themselves at the mercy of a nigger's gun  "let's just forget it
I go my way you go yours"   that's your boy Chester talkin'  you a goddamn lie
That's what they all said
Beggin' for his life
Your boy told me his whole life story
And you was in that story general
Of the bloody nigger killer of Baton Rouge..
I knew me I was gonna' have some fun
You shut your lyin' nigger lips up
He just heard tell why you here is all
It was cold the day I killed your boy
And I don't mean snwoy mountain in Wyoming cold
It was colder than that
And on that cold day  with your boy at the business end of my gun barrel..
Right down to his bare ass
Then I told him to start walkin'
I walked his naked ass for two hours 'fore his cold collapsed him
You never even knew my boy
No he didn't
He's just a sneaky nigger tryin' to getcha to go for that gun
But this time he wasn't begging to go home
He knew he'd never see his home again
And he wasn't beggin' for his life neither
'Cos he knew that was long gone
Now don't judge your boy too harshly general
You'd be surprised what a man that cold would do for a blanket
Wanna know what your boy did
I took my big black pecker outta' my pants
And I made him crawl through the snow on all fours over to it
Then I grabbed a hand full of that black hair on the back his head...  Then I stuck my big black Johnson right down his goddamn throat
And it was fulla' blood so it was warm
You bet your sweet ass it was warm
Starting to see pictures ain't ya'
Him shakin' him cryin'  me laughin'  and him not understandin'  but you understand doncha' Sandy
I never did give your boy that blanket
Even after all he did and he did everything I asked
No blanket
That blanket was just a heart breakin' liar's promise
So what you gonna' do old man
You gonna' spend the next two or three days  ignore the nigger that killed your boy  ignoring how I made him suffer
Ignoring how I made him...  Lick all over my Johnson
The dumbest thing your boy ever did...  Was to let me know..
Chapter four domergue's got a secret  about fifteen minutes has passed since we last left our characters
Joe gag volunteered to take smithers dead body outside
Straws we drawn to see who would help him...  O.B
Lost
Chris John Ruth and oswaldo  had vigorous debate about the legality of selfdefense murder they just transpired
Marquis Warren who is supremely confident about the  legality of what just transpired ignored them  sat at a table by himself and drank Brandy
Captain Chris mannix dawn the dead generals coat and  joined oswaldo in lighting the candles and lanterns
John Ruth held the door close waiting for Joe gage and o.B
To return
Bob enjoyed an manzana roja
Domergue however  hasn't moved from her spot at the community dinner table since John Ruth uncuffed her
John Ruth...  Yeah
Let's go back a bit
Your boy black dudes dingus in his mouth
Fifteen minutes ago major Warren shot general smithers in front of everybody
But fourty seconds before that something equally  as important happened but not everybody saw it
He did everything I asked no blanket
And the only one to see 'em do it...  Was domergue
That's why this chapter is called...  Domergue's got a secret
John Ruth
Yeah
Yeah
You come back with anything else but a guitar
Domergues death march you got it
Yeah yeah yeah
I got it
That's the one you like to sing in the stagecoach huh
Yeah
It's kinda' pretty
Got another verse to it
Go ahead sing it
Gimme that guitar
Turn around
No no no no no
Yeah yeah yeah yeah shut up
When you get to hell John
Tell 'em Daisy sent ya'
Oh my god
Gimme that fucking gun
Everybody get your back sides up against that back wall over yonder
Goddammit  get or don't get Joe gage
It's up to you
I'll get
Then get
Everybody turn around and put your hands on that wall
Move 'em down snowshoes
Everybody keep your mouth shut and do like I say
You move a little sudden a little strange; You gonna' get a bullet
Not a warning not a question; A bullet
You got that
Let me hear you say "I got it"
"I got it"
We have it
Chris mannix come over here on this side
Come on
Take this gun out of my holster
Point it at them
Like I said anybody does anything
Kill 'em
I don't know 'bout all that
But you ain't the killer who poisoned that coffy
'Cos you almost drunk it your own damn self
But one of 'em is
Gimme the key
Gimme the key
You motherfucking black bastard
You're gonna' die on this mountain and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do
'Meant it didn't I
And you need to understand you just killed the only  man here comitted to gettin' you to red rock alive
Now one of y'all... Is workin' with her
Or two of y'all is workin' with her
But only one of you poisoned the coffy
But John Ruth's trying to hang your woman  so you kill him... okaymaybe
But o.B
Wasn't hangin' nobody
He damn sure would
But he sure enough led over there dead now though ain't he
He damn sure is you sons of bitches
Just like any one of us who'd drank that coffy
Now those of y'all with your hands on the wall  don't practice in poison need to think about that
Think about how that coulda' you been you rollin' around on this floor
And about the men standin' next ta' ya' would be responsible
And I know who I got my money on
Not so fast Chris
We'll get there
Let's slow it down
Let's slow it way down
He did
Yeah he did didn't he
But it's the stew that's got me thinking
How long you say minnie been gone
A week
Si
See my mama used to make stew
And it always tasted the same no matter the meat
He made stew too and like my mama's
I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper  to I was a full grown man
Now I ain't had minnie's stew in six months so I ain't no expert but that  damn sure is minnie's stew
So if minnie's on the north side visiting her mama for a week  how'd she make the stew this morning
And this
This... is sweet Dave's chair
When I sat in it earlier I couldn't belive it
Nobody sits in sweet Dave's chaire
And if... he went to the north side..
What's in the chair
Just what I thought
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood
So...  Are you actually accusing me of murder
And if it's you  that means minnie and her man ain't at her mama's
They're lyin' out back there dead somewhere
Or if it's you britisch man  the real oswaldo mobray is lyin' in a ditch somewhere
And  you're just an English fella' passin' off his papers
Or we go by my theory which is the ugliest guy did it
Which makes it you Joe gage
So I take it you've deduced the coffy was  poisoned while you were murdering the old man
Well mi negro amigo during that whole incident..
I was sitting on that side of the room
I didn't say you poisoned the coffy
I said you didn't make the stew
And both of y'all murdered minnie  and sweet Dave and whoever else picked this bad luck  day to visit minnie's haberdashery this morning
And at some point y'all intented to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy
But you didn't count on the blizzard and you didn't count on the two of us
That's as far as I got
How am I doin'
So do you intend to murder me based on a far fetched nigger theory
Or can you prove it cabrone
It ain't so far fetched senior Bob
And it's a little bit more then my theory
Four months
If you would have been here two and half years ago  you'd know about the sign usta' hang above the bar
Minnie mentioned that to you
You know what that sign said senior Bob
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed"  minnie hung that sign up the day she opened this habadashery
And it hung over that bar every day till she  took down a little over two years ago
You know why she took it down
She started lettin' in dogs
So when you tell me minnie went to north side to visit her mama
Well I find that highly unlikely... but okay  maybe
But when you tell me minnie mink took the habadashery  the most precious thing to her in the whole world  and left it in hands of a goddamn Mexican
Well that's what I meant in the barn when I said: "That sure don't sound like minnie"
And if you lyin which you are  then you killed minnie  and sweet Dave
Four measly bulltes and there goes senior Bob
That still don't get us no closer...  To which one of y'all poisoned the coffy though
No it sure don't
Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy to free Daisy
If I don't hear a confession from one of you  motherfuckers quick fast and in a hurry  I'm gonna' pull this whole pot of coffy down that bitches goddamn throat
Okay time's up
Stop
Alright I did it it was me I poisoned the coffy
You gonna' die now you murderin' bastard
Major Warren please let me sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell
He's worth ten of you
Warren can I kill him
Say adios to your huevos
Major Warren
I ain't got no gun sheriff
Hey charly my how the hell are you

Warm youself up and drink some coffy
Okay

Step outside you and your friends can stretch  your legs

Well make yourself comfortable
Get warm by the fire
Stove fireplace whatever

Oh and Judy said something about the best coffy in the world
Yes I do belive Judy did say something about the best coffy in the world
But I'll tell ya what it is
It's hot and it's strong and it's good
And  in this snow it sure 'nuff warms your ass up
You don't need to sell it minnie you need make it
And you need to get your ass out there and  help charly with them bags and get Ed in here
Yes ma'am but fix the coffy
I don't know some old man
I'm just tellin' you what she said
Anyway she sent me out here to help charly she wants to talk to you
Got 'em Ed
Miss minnie
Would you roll me a cigarette
Sure honey I smoke red apple tobacco that all right
Don't mind me gentlemen I'm just watching
You know I must of had at least twelve people  teach me that goddamn game
Just never could keep the moves in my head
But if I'm not disturbing I like to watch
Hell no
I like whippin' this old man's ass in front of a audience  you ain't whippin' shit
Oh that's real nice what is that
It's French

Oui  yes

Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen that could drive a six horse team
Hell yeah kinda of a stupid question
Could you holding this for me
Rock steady madame
You gotta' very sweet accent where that from England
I take exception to that
New zeeland
Carefull madame
Is it anywhere near old Zealand
It's where I'm from it's our biggest city
It's about damn time
Best coffy on the mountain
I'll don't know 'bout all that
Stagecoach drivers like it
Most find it a mite too strong
Can't be too strong on this mountain thank you
Well what'd ya' think
He adds something not much but something
What do you think Pete
Well I must admit he does make the set up more convincing
Do we collect the bodies and Chuck 'em in the well out there
And then start unhitching the horses and get 'em in the barn and get 'em fed
Well hang on by puttin the horses away that's easy enough
Look I just started working here
Whatever minnie to make y'all mad
I had nothing to do with it
Well old man  if you was a cat what just happened here  would count as one of your nine lives
Yes
And when it comes to that pile of niggers we building out back  won't take nothin' to make you general of it
I expect no less
Not so fast old man
You might have a way out of this yet
Later today  dirty son of a gun's gonna come in here
And he's gonna have my sister with him  and he's gonna have her in chains
You know why
No
Ten thousand dollars
That's why
I'm gonna' kill that fella' and turn my sister lose
Now do you have any reason why you'd want to interfere  with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope
No
You don't
You sure you don't
I mean we did just kill minnie and sweet Dave
You and sweet Dave seemed pretty chummy over here
I just met these people
That is a good answer old man
So when they get here  you just sit your ass in this chair
And you don't do nothin'
You don't say nothin'
Hello thank you good night that's about it
Maybe your name but that's it
Hello thank you good night and...   Maybe your name
Go to sleep
And don't you say nothin' and I mean nothin'  to that bounty hunter that's got my sister
Do you understand
Yes
When it's safe I kill him free my sister and leave you be
Deal thank you
During the next four hours Jody and the boys Chuck the bodies down the well
Put away the horses
Stash weapons for further use
And waited for John Ruth and Daisy's stage to arrive
Here they come
Okay boys this is it get ready
Let's get ready
Now remember it dosen't matter if we have four men or fory  we're still gonna' be facing John Ruth chained  to my sister with a pistol pointed at her belly
But you believe that's exactly what we're gonna do
So the name of the game here is patience
Trapped here for two or three days at some point he will close his eyes  and that's when you blow the top of his head off
Remember old man my sister don't make it off this mountain alive neither do you
I'll do my best
What the hell's going on we weren't expecting another stage tonight
I just got through putting the horses away
This ain't the normal line
But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard  so it looks like you're stuck with us
I can do another one
And sweet Dave inside
They ain't here
Where's minnie and sweet Dave
He says they ain't here
He's lookin' after the place while they gone
I'm Bob
Well whoever you are help o.B
With the horses
Get 'em outta this cold before that blizzard hit's 'em
I just put those other horses away
You need it done fast you need to help
I got two of my best men on it
Come on let's go
Open up
You have to kick it open
What
Last chapter black man white hell  how you doin' old boy
They shot my nuts off they're freezin'  burining up the same time bleedin like a stuck pig
And these motherfuckers did it
That's how I'm doin'
Well my leg hurts really bad
But I think if I'm put all my weight on my right foot  I'm just bein' sarcastic I don't give a fuck about your leg
Just make yourself comfortable
Don't worry about my comfort
Shit
I can't feel my ass no more
All right
You
Fella' in the basement
You either give up by the time I count to three  or I shoot domergue in the head
One!..
two!..
I'm comin' up
Hold on there you bushwhacker sack shooter you  just open the door we tell you to come up
Now throw out your pistol
Throw it to the bed
Well he got another
I ain't got another pistol
Well you better shit another pistol out your ass
Cause if you don't throw one up here in the next two seconds we gonna' kill this bitch
See
Now...  With your hands where we can see 'em..
Slowly come on up
How ya' doin' dummy
Better now I see your ugly face
How you like you that
You bushwhacker castrator
What are you doin' he was giving up
I'm sorry honey
May I sit in the chair
Yes you may
Keep your hands flat on that table
And don't move 'em
Mannix
You sure picked the wrong time to turn into a nigger lover
You're about to be murdered in some nigger named  minnie's house and you don't even know why
Okay bitch..
I am workin with all three of them fella's..
But not cause they got butterflies in their belly 'bout me
But because we're all gang members the Jody domergue gang
That fella' y'all just killed in the basement was Jody domergue my brother
You wanna tell 'em bounty man
He's a big bad cat
He's worth fifty thousand dollars
And every member of his gang is wort at least ten
Wich finally explains why you're worth ten
And what's gonna' happen when that sun comes  out nigger so is my brother's fifteen men  comin' straight here for us
Tell 'em grouch
If we couldn't kill John Ruth and free Daisy here
Their job was to sack the town kill John Ruth and free Daisy there
Oh yeah
And Chris I'm tellin' you you ain't done anything yet we can't forgive
So...   Let's make a deal
You gonna' let that nigger speak for you Chris
Hold it Warren
Seein' as she ain't got nothin' to sell I'm  kinda curious about her sales pitch humor me
What's... your... deal
Easy
Take your gun shoot that nigger dead
Then we sit here all nice like for the next two days
When the snow melts...  We go back to Mexico and you go on to red rock to get that star pinned on your chest
Well... we can give 'em Marco
He's worth twelve thousand dollars
That's "Marco the Mexican"
Sheeit after I blew his face off Marco ain't worth a peso
If I die in the next two days which is more than likely you can have me
Under the name "English Pete hicox" I've gotta' federal  bounty of fifteen thousand dollars on my head
And it's all your Chris
You keep talkin' Pete
Joe gage who you be
Grouch douglass
You heard of him
Yeah I heard of grouch douglass
He's worth ten just like Daisy
Oh you can kill us all
But you'll never spend a cent of that bounty money  and you'll never leave this mountain alive
Because when that snow melts the rest of Jody's  gang  all fifteen of 'em that were waiting  in red rock are comin' here
If you really want all that domergue gang bounty money  you still got to get all our corpses into red rock
And that ain't gonna' be so easy
Cause I doubt you can drive a four horse team
And that wagon out there is too heavy for a two horse team
So that means you're gonna' hafta' lead a string of horses into red rock  and with that deep snow after a blizzard  you ain't gonna' be able to get away with any more then let's say one body per horse
So that's you leading a string of four horses into red rock  and with all them horses in that snow  and you all by your lonesome you're gonna be a mite poky
And you gonna' run smack dab into the domergue  gang and agin grouch how many is that
And when those fifteen killers  come across you  in possession of all of our dead bodies they  ain't just gonna' kill you and that nigger
There gonna go back to red rock and kill every son of a bitch in that town
You wanna save the town
Then shoot that nigger dead
You belive in Jesus now huh bitch
Well good 'cos 'bout meet him
Anybody else wanna' make a deal huh
The deal still stands Chris
It's still all on that nigger
Shoot 'em dead take my body  and sit out the snow with Daisy and grou  mannix
Catch 'em here
Catch 'em here
Yeah
And I get oswaldo and Joe gage
Yeah
But Jody's worth fifty thousand what 'bout his body
You gonna make a deal with this diabolical bitch
I'm not sayin' I'm gonna' make a deal with her we're just talkin'
So what about Jody's body and the fifty thousand
You've gotten greedy reb no deal
We take Jody's body back with us he got children
So I kill Warren... And we're all friends
No deal tramp
Chris you're makin' the biggest mistake of your life
When our boys get here in a coupla' days their gonna cut your nuts off
And there won't be a stick left in that town unburnt
Well I guess I should be plum scared right now huh
If you had any brains you would be
Here's the problem Daisy
In order for me to be scared of your threats  I got to believe in those fifteen extra gang members waitin' it out in red rock
And boy oh boy..
I sure don't
And you watched me pork up and didn't say shit...  And I believe...  You all what you've always been...  A lyin' bitch who will do anything...  To cheat that rope waitin' for her in red rock
Including shittin' out fifteen extra gang members  whenever you needs be
And..
I'm lookin' at 'em right here right right  now
Goddamn right
You're gonna' die on this mountain Chris
My brother leds an army of men  horse shit
My daddy led an army he led a renegade amry fightin' a lost cause
Your brother's just a owl hoot who led a gang of killers
I don't feel so good
Oh shit
You still alive white boy
Mannix
Fuck
Hey boy
Chris mannix
Wake the fuck up
Wake up white boy
I ain't dead yet you black bastard
Chris mannix I may have misjudged you
No no no don't shoot her
Why the hell not
John Ruth
John Ruth was one mighty mighty bastard
What's the Las thing...  That bastard did 'fore he died
Was save your life
We gonna' die white boy
But there's one thing left we do have a say in
And I say shootin's to good for her...  John Ruth coulda shot her anywhere anytime along the way  but John Ruth was the hangman...  And when the hangman catches ya' you don't die by no bullet
When the the hangman catches ya'...  You hang
"You only need to hang mean bastards.
"But mean bastards you need to hang"
Hang on Daisy
I wanna watch
Now that was a nice dance
That sure was pretty
Hey...  Can I see that Lincoln letter
